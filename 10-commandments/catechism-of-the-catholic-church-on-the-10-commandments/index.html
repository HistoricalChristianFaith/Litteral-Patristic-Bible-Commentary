<p><span><b>SECTION TWO<br />THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</b> </span>
<p><a name="2052"></a><b>"Teacher, what must I do . . .?"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2052</font></u></a></b> "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" To the young man who asked this question, Jesus answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the "One there is who is good," as the supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: "If you would enter life, keep the commandments." And he cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of neighbor: "You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother." Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."<sup>1</sup>
<p><a name="2053"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2053</font></u></a></b> To this first reply Jesus adds a second: "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."<sup>2</sup> This reply does not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. The Law has not been abolished,<sup>3</sup> but rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity.<sup>4</sup> The evangelical counsels are inseparable from the Commandments. 
<p><a name="2054"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2054</font></u></a></b> Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the Spirit at work in their letter. He preached a "righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees"<sup>5</sup> as well as that of the Gentiles.<sup>6</sup> He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments. "You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not kill.' . . . But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment."<sup>7</sup>
<p><a name="2055"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2055</font></u></a></b> When someone asks him, "Which commandment in the Law is the greatest?"<sup>8</sup> Jesus replies: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets."<sup>9</sup> The Decalogue must be interpreted in light of this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>The commandments: "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.<sup>10</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2056"></a><b>The Decalogue in Sacred Scripture</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2056</font></u></a></b> The word "Decalogue" means literally "ten words."<sup>11</sup> God revealed these "ten words" to his people on the holy mountain. They were written "with the finger of God,"<sup>12</sup> unlike the other commandments written by Moses.<sup>13</sup> They are pre-eminently the words of God. They are handed on to us in the books of <i>Exodus</i><sup>14</sup> and <i>Deuteronomy</i>.<sup>15</sup> Beginning with the Old Testament, the sacred books refer to the "ten words,"<sup>16</sup> but it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their full meaning will be revealed. 
<p><a name="2057"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2057</font></u></a></b> The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the Exodus, God's great liberating event at the center of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative commandments, prohibitions, or as positive precepts such as: "Honor your father and mother," the "ten words" point out the conditions of a life freed from the slavery of sin. The Decalogue is a path of life: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>If you love the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, then you shall live and multiply.<sup>17</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p>This liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the commandment about the sabbath rest, directed also to foreigners and slaves: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out thence with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.<sup>18</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2058"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2058</font></u></a></b> The "ten words" sum up and proclaim God's law: "These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them to me."<sup>19</sup> For this reason these two tables are called "the Testimony." In fact, they contain the terms of the covenant concluded between God and his people. These "tables of the Testimony" were to be deposited in "the ark."<sup>20</sup>
<p><a name="2059"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2059</font></u></a></b> The "ten words" are pronounced by God in the midst of a theophany ("The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire."<sup>21</sup>). They belong to God's revelation of himself and his glory. The gift of the Commandments is the gift of God himself and his holy will. In making his will known, God reveals himself to his people. 
<p><a name="2060"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2060</font></u></a></b> The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of the covenant God sealed with his own. In <i>Exodus</i>, the revelation of the "ten words" is granted between the proposal of the covenant<sup>22</sup> and its conclusion - after the people had committed themselves to "do" all that the Lord had said, and to "obey" it.<sup>23</sup> The Decalogue is never handed on without first recalling the covenant ("The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.").<sup>24</sup>
<p><a name="2061"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2061</font></u></a></b> The Commandments take on their full meaning within the covenant. According to Scripture, man's moral life has all its meaning in and through the covenant. The first of the "ten words" recalls that God loved his people first: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Since there was a passing from the paradise of freedom to the slavery of this world, in punishment for sin, the first phrase of the Decalogue, the first word of God's commandments, bears on freedom "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."<sup>25</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2062"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2062</font></u></a></b> The Commandments properly so-called come in the second place: they express the implications of belonging to God through the establishment of the covenant. Moral existence is a <i>response </i>to the Lord's loving initiative. It is the acknowledgement and homage given to God and a worship of thanksgiving. It is cooperation with the plan God pursues in history. 
<p><a name="2063"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2063</font></u></a></b> The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also attested to by the fact that all the obligations are stated in the first person ("I am the Lord.") and addressed by God to another personal subject ("you"). In all God's commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates the recipient. God makes his will known to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes it known to the whole people: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>The Lord prescribed love towards God and taught justice towards neighbor, so that man would be neither unjust, nor unworthy of God. Thus, through the Decalogue, God prepared man to become his friend and to live in harmony with his neighbor. . . . The words of the Decalogue remain likewise for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they have received amplification and development from the fact of the coming of the Lord in the flesh.<sup>26</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2064"></a><b>The Decalogue in the Church's Tradition</b>
<p><b>2064</b> In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example of Jesus, the tradition of the Church has acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue. 
<p><a name="2065"></a><b>2065</b> <span>Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied a predominant place in the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of expressing the commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to memorize and in positive form. They are still in use today. The catechisms of the Church have often expounded Christian morality by following the order of the Ten Commandments. </span>
<p><a name="2066"></a><b>2066</b> <span>The division and numbering of the Commandments have varied in the course of history. The present catechism follows the division of the Commandments established by St. Augustine, which has become traditional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran confessions. The Greek Fathers worked out a slightly different division, which is found in the Orthodox Churches and Reformed communities. </span>
<p><a name="2067"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2067</font></u></a></b> The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love of God and love of neighbor. The first three concern love of God, and the other seven love of neighbor. 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>As charity comprises the two commandments to which the Lord related the whole Law and the prophets . . . so the Ten Commandments were themselves given on two tablets. Three were written on one tablet and seven on the other.<sup>27</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2068"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2068</font></u></a></b> The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are obligatory for Christians and that the justified man is still bound to keep them;<sup>28</sup> the Second Vatican Council confirms: "The bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord . . . the mission of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the observance of the Commandments."<sup>29</sup>
<p><a name="2069"></a><b>The unity of the Decalogue</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2069</font></u></a></b> The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each "word" refers to each of the others and to all of them; they reciprocally condition one another. The two tables shed light on one another; they form an organic unity. To transgress one commandment is to infringe all the others.<sup>30</sup> One cannot honor another person without blessing God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all men, his creatures. The Decalogue brings man's religious and social life into unity. 
<p><a name="2070"></a><b>The Decalogue and the natural law </b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2070</font></u></a></b> The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same time they teach us the true humanity of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent in the nature of the human person. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of them. This was the Decalogue.<sup>31</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2071"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2071</font></u></a></b> The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to reason alone, have been revealed. To attain a complete and certain understanding of the requirements of the natural law, sinful humanity needed this revelation: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>A full explanation of the commandments of the Decalogue became necessary in the state of sin because the light of reason was obscured and the will had gone astray.<sup>32</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p>We know God's commandments through the divine revelation proposed to us in the Church, and through the voice of moral conscience. 
<p><a name="2072"></a><b>The obligation of the Decalogue</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2072</font></u></a></b> Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and towards his neighbor, the Ten Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, <i>grave </i>obligations. They are fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten Commandments are engraved by God in the human heart. 
<p><a name="2073"></a><b>2073</b> Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself, light. Thus abusive language is forbidden by the fifth commandment, but would be a grave offense only as a result of circumstances or the offender's intention. 
<p><a name="2074"></a><b>"Apart from me you can do nothing"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2074</font></u></a></b> Jesus says: "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."<sup>33</sup> The fruit referred to in this saying is the holiness of a life made fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe in Jesus Christ, partake of his mysteries, and keep his commandments, the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father and his brethren, our Father and our brethren. His person becomes, through the Spirit, the living and interior rule of our activity. "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."<sup>34</sup>

<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them.<sup>3</sup>

<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. "YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE"</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2084"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2084</font></u></a></b> God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful loving, and liberating action in the history of the one he addresses: "I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." The first word contains the first commandment of the Law: "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve him. . . . You shall not go after other gods."<sup>5</sup> God's first call and just demand is that man accept him and worship him. 
<p><a name="2085"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2085</font></u></a></b> The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel.<sup>6</sup> The revelation of the vocation and truth of man is linked to the revelation of God. Man's vocation is to make God manifest by acting in conformity with his creation "in the image and likeness of God": 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>There will never be another God, Trypho, and there has been no other since the world began . . . than he who made and ordered the universe. We do not think that our God is different from yours. He is the same who brought your fathers out of Egypt "by his powerful hand and his outstretched arm." We do not place our hope in some other god, for there is none, but in the same God as you do: the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<sup>7</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2086"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2086</font></u></a></b> "The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity. When we say 'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that we must necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at the beginning and end of his commandments: 'I am the LORD.'"<sup>8</sup>
<p><a name="2087"></a><b>Faith</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2087</font></u></a></b> Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love to us. St. Paul speaks of the "obedience of faith"<sup>9</sup> as our first obligation. He shows that "ignorance of God" is the principle and explanation of all moral deviations.<sup>10</sup> Our duty toward God is to believe in him and to bear witness to him. 
<p><a name="2088"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2088</font></u></a></b> The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith: 
<p><i>Voluntary doubt</i> about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. <i>Involuntary doubt</i> refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual blindness. 
<p><a name="2089"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2089</font></u></a></b> <i>Incredulity </i>is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to assent to it. "<i>Heresy </i>is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or it is likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same; <i>apostasy </i>is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; <i>schism </i>is the refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him."<sup>11</sup>
<p><a name="2090"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>Hope</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2090</font></u></a></b> When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God; it is also the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment. 
<p><a name="2091"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2091</font></u></a></b> The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, namely, despair and presumption: 
<p>By <i>despair</i>, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to his promises - and to his mercy. 
<p><a name="2092"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2092</font></u></a></b> There are two kinds of <i>presumption</i>. Either man presumes upon his own capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without help from on high), or he presumes upon God's almighty power or his mercy (hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion and glory without merit). 
<p><a name="2093"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>Charity</b>
<p><b>2093</b> Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation to respond with sincere love to divine charity. The first commandment enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures for him and because of him.<sup>12</sup>
<p><a name="2094"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2094</font></u></a></b> One can sin against God's love in various ways: 
<p>- <i>indifference </i>neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power. 
<p>- <i>ingratitude </i>fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him love for love. 
<p>- <i>lukewarmness </i>is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity. 
<p>- <i>acedia </i>or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness. 
<p>- <i>hatred of God</i> comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and inflicts punishments. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. "HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE"</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2095"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2095</font></u></a></b> The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity inform and give life to the moral virtues. Thus charity leads us to render to God what we as creatures owe him in all justice. The <i>virtue of religion</i> disposes us to have this attitude. 
<p><a name="2096"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>Adoration</b>
<p><b>2096</b> Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore God is to acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Savior, the Lord and Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful Love. "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve," says Jesus, citing <i>Deuteronomy</i>.<sup>13</sup>
<p><a name="2097"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2097</font></u></a></b> To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute submission, the "nothingness of the creature" who would not exist but for God. To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude that he has done great things and holy is his name.<sup>14</sup> The worship of the one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the slavery of sin and the idolatry of the world. 
<p><a name="2098"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>Prayer</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2098</font></u></a></b> The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first commandment are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind toward God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of praise and thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable condition for being able to obey God's commandments. "[We] ought always to pray and not lose heart."<sup>15</sup>

<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2099</font></u></a></b> It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and gratitude, supplication and communion: "Every action done so as to cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve blessedness, is a true sacrifice."<sup>16</sup>
<p><a name="2100"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2100</font></u></a></b> Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of spiritual sacrifice: "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit. . . . "<sup>17</sup> The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of neighbor.<sup>18</sup> Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice."<sup>19</sup> The only perfect sacrifice is the one that Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father's love and for our salvation.<sup>20</sup> By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we can make our lives a sacrifice to God. 
<p><a name="2101"></a><b>Promises and vows</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2101</font></u></a></b> In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make <i>promises </i>to God. Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God. 
<p><a name="2102"></a><b>2102</b> "A <i>vow </i>is a deliberate and free promise made to God concerning a possible and better good which must be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion,"<sup>21</sup> A vow is an act of <i>devotion </i>in which the Christian dedicates himself to God or promises him some good work. By fulfilling his vows he renders to God what has been promised and consecrated to Him. The <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> shows us St. Paul concerned to fulfill the vows he had made.<sup>22</sup>
<p><a name="2103"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2103</font></u></a></b> The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to practice the <i>evangelical counsels</i>:<sup>23</sup>

<p><span>The Church can, in certain cases and for proportionate reasons, dispense from vows and promises<sup>25</sup></span>

<p><a name="2105"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2105</font></u></a></b> The duty of offering God genuine worship concerns man both individually and socially. This is "the traditional Catholic teaching on the moral duty of individuals and societies toward the true religion and the one Church of Christ."<sup>30</sup> By constantly evangelizing men, the Church works toward enabling them "to infuse the Christian spirit into the mentality and mores, laws and structures of the communities in which [they] live."<sup>31</sup> The social duty of Christians is to respect and awaken in each man the love of the true and the good. It requires them to make known the worship of the one true religion which subsists in the Catholic and apostolic Church.<sup>32</sup> Christians are called to be the light of the world. Thus, the Church shows forth the kingship of Christ over all creation and in particular over human societies.<sup>33</sup>
<p><a name="2106"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2106</font></u></a></b> "Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor is anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in association with others, within due limits."<sup>34</sup> This right is based on the very nature of the human person, whose dignity enables him freely to assent to the divine truth which transcends the temporal order. For this reason it "continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation of seeking the truth and adhering to it."<sup>35</sup>
<p><a name="2107"></a><b>2107</b> <span>"If because of the circumstances of a particular people special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional organization of a state, the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom must be recognized and respected as well."<sup>36</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2108"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2108</font></u></a></b> The right to religious liberty is neither a moral license to adhere to error, nor a supposed right to error,<sup>37</sup> but rather a natural right of the human person to civil liberty, i.e., immunity, within just limits, from external constraint in religious matters by political authorities. This natural right ought to be acknowledged in the juridical order of society in such a way that it constitutes a civil right.<sup>38</sup>

<p><b><a name="III"><font color="#000000">III. "YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME"</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2110"></a><b>2110</b> The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion. 
<p><a name="2111"></a><b>Superstition</b>
<p><b>2111</b> Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition.<sup>41</sup>
<p><a name="2112"></a><b>Idolatry</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2112</font></u></a></b> The first commandment condemns <i>polytheism</i>. It requires man neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the one true God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols, [of] silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make their worshippers empty: "Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them."<sup>42</sup> God, however, is the "living God"<sup>43</sup> who gives life and intervenes in history. 
<p><a name="2113"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2113</font></u></a></b> Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, "You cannot serve God and mammon."<sup>44</sup> Many martyrs died for not adoring "the Beast"<sup>45</sup> refusing even to simulate such worship. Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God.<sup>46</sup>
<p><a name="2114"></a><b>2114</b> Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God. The commandment to worship the Lord alone integrates man and saves him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion of man's innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who "transfers his indestructible notion of God to anything other than God."<sup>47</sup>
<p><a name="2115"></a><b>Divination and magic</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2115</font></u></a></b> God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility. 
<p><a name="2116"></a><b>2116</b> All forms of <i>divination </i>are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future.<sup>48</sup> Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone. 
<p><a name="2117"></a><b>2117</b> All practices of <i>magic </i>or <i>sorcery</i>, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. <i>Spiritism </i>often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity. 
<p><a name="2118"></a><b>Irreligion</b>
<p><b>2118</b> God's first commandment condemns the main sins of irreligion: tempting God, in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony. 
<p><a name="2119"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2119</font></u></a></b> <i>Tempting God</i> consists in putting his goodness and almighty power to the test by word or deed. Thus Satan tried to induce Jesus to throw himself down from the Temple and, by this gesture, force God to act.<sup>49</sup> Jesus opposed Satan with the word of God: "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test."<sup>50</sup> The challenge contained in such tempting of God wounds the respect and trust we owe our Creator and Lord. It always harbors doubt about his love, his providence, and his power.<sup>51</sup>
<p><a name="2120"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2120</font></u></a></b> <i>Sacrilege </i>consists in profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments and other liturgical actions, as well as persons, things, or places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially when committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the true Body of Christ is made substantially present for us.<sup>52</sup>
<p><a name="2121"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2121</font></u></a></b> <i>Simony </i>is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things.<sup>53</sup> To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: "Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God's gift with money!"<sup>54</sup> Peter thus held to the words of Jesus: "You received without pay, give without pay."<sup>55</sup> It is impossible to appropriate to oneself spiritual goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they have their source in God. One can receive them only from him, without payment. 
<p><a name="2122"></a><b>2122</b> <span>The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the sacraments beyond the offerings defined by the competent authority, always being careful that the needy are not deprived of the help of the sacraments because of their poverty."<sup>56</sup> The competent authority determines these "offerings" in accordance with the principle that the Christian people ought to contribute to the support of the Church's ministers. "The laborer deserves his food."<sup>57</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2123"></a><b>Atheism</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2123</font></u></a></b> "Many . . . of our contemporaries either do not at all perceive, or explicitly reject, this intimate and vital bond of man to God. Atheism must therefore be regarded as one of the most serious problems of our time."<sup>58</sup>
<p><a name="2124"></a><b>2124</b> The name "atheism" covers many very different phenomena. One common form is the practical materialism which restricts its needs and aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism falsely considers man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme control, of his own history."<sup>59</sup> Another form of contemporary atheism looks for the liberation of man through economic and social liberation. "It holds that religion, of its very nature, thwarts such emancipation by raising man's hopes in a future life, thus both deceiving him and discouraging him from working for a better form of life on earth."<sup>60</sup>
<p><a name="2125"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2125</font></u></a></b> Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the virtue of religion.<sup>61</sup> The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion."<sup>62</sup>
<p><a name="2126"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2126</font></u></a></b> Atheism is often based on a false conception of human autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence on God.<sup>63</sup> Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity of man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in God. . . . "<sup>64</sup> "For the Church knows full well that her message is in harmony with the most secret desires of the human heart."<sup>65</sup>
<p><a name="2127"></a><b>Agnosticism</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2127</font></u></a></b> Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases the agnostic refrains from denying God; instead he postulates the existence of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing itself, and about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the agnostic makes no judgment about God's existence, declaring it impossible to prove, or even to affirm or deny. 
<p><a name="2128"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2128</font></u></a></b> Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for God, but it can equally express indifferentism, a flight from the ultimate question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience. Agnosticism is all too often equivalent to practical atheism.

<p><a name="2129"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2129</font></u></a></b> The divine injunction included the prohibition of every representation of God by the hand of man. <i>Deuteronomy </i>explains: "Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure. . . . "<sup>66</sup> It is the absolutely transcendent God who revealed himself to Israel. "He is the all," but at the same time "he is greater than all his works."<sup>67</sup> He is "the author of beauty."<sup>68</sup>
<p><a name="2130"></a><b>2130</b> Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained or permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically toward salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze serpent, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim.<sup>69</sup>

By becoming incarnate, the Son of God introduced a new "economy" of images. 
<p><a name="2132"></a><b>2132</b> The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor rendered to an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it."<sup>70</sup> The honor paid to sacred images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration due to God alone:

<p><a name="2148"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2148</font></u></a></b> <i>Blasphemy </i>is directly opposed to the second commandment. It consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly - words of hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in failing in respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's name. St. James condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by which you are called."<sup>78</sup> The prohibition of blasphemy extends to language against Christ's Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. The misuse of God's name to commit a crime can provoke others to repudiate religion. 
<p>Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name. It is in itself a grave sin.<sup>79</sup>

<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. TAKING THE NAME OF THE LORD IN VAIN</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2150"></a><b>2150</b> The second commandment<i> forbids false oaths</i>. Taking an oath or swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own truthfulness. An oath engages the Lord's name. "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve him, and swear by his name."<sup>81</sup>
<p><a name="2151"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2151</font></u></a></b> Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord, God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God's truth. A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie. 
<p><a name="2152"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2152</font></u></a></b> A person commits <i>perjury </i>when he makes a promise under oath with no intention of keeping it, or when after promising on oath he does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the Lord of all speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed is contrary to the holiness of the divine name. 
<p><a name="2153"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2153</font></u></a></b> In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you, Do not swear at all. . . . Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one."<sup>82</sup> Jesus teaches that every oath involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock. 
<p><a name="2154"></a><b>2154</b> Following St. Paul,<sup>83</sup> the tradition of the Church has understood Jesus' words as not excluding oaths made for grave and right reasons (for example, in court). "An oath, that is the invocation of the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless in truth, in judgment, and in justice."<sup>84</sup>
<p><a name="2155"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2155</font></u></a></b> The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither use it for trivial matters, nor take an oath which on the basis of the circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority unjustly requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil authorities, it may be refused. It must be refused when it is required for purposes contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial communion.

<p><a name="2156"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2156</font></u></a></b> The sacrament of Baptism is conferred "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."<sup>85</sup> In Baptism, the Lord's name sanctifies man, and the Christian receives his name in the Church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple who has lived a life of exemplary fidelity to the Lord. The patron saint provides a model of charity; we are assured of his intercession. The "baptismal name" can also express a Christian mystery or Christian virtue. "Parents, sponsors, and the pastor are to see that a name is not given which is foreign to Christian sentiment."<sup>86</sup>
<p><a name="2157"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2157</font></u></a></b> The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." The baptized person dedicates the day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which lets him act in the Spirit as a child of the Father. The sign of the cross strengthens us in temptations and difficulties. 
<p><a name="2158"></a><b>2158</b> God calls each one by name.<sup>87</sup> Everyone's name is sacred. The name is the icon of the person. It demands respect as a sign of the dignity of the one who bears it. 
<p><a name="2159"></a><b>2159</b> The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the kingdom, the mysterious and unique character of each person marked with God's name will shine forth in splendor. "To him who conquers . . . I will give a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it."<sup>88</sup> "Then I looked, and Lo, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a hundred and forty- four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads."<sup>89</sup>

<dl>
<dd><span>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work; but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work.<sup>90</sup>
<p>The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.<sup>91</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. THE SABBATH DAY</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2168"></a><b>2168</b> The third commandment of the Decalogue recalls the holiness of the sabbath: "The seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD."<sup>92</sup>
<p><a name="2169"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2169</font></u></a></b> In speaking of the sabbath Scripture recalls creation: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it."<sup>93</sup>
<p><a name="2170"></a><b>2170</b> Scripture also reveals in the Lord's day a <i>memorial of Israel's liberation</i> from bondage in Egypt: "You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out thence with mighty hand and outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day."<sup>94</sup>
<p><a name="2171"></a><b>2171</b> God entrusted the sabbath to Israel to keep as a <i>sign of the irrevocable covenant</i>.<sup>95</sup> The sabbath is for the Lord, holy and set apart for the praise of God, his work of creation, and his saving actions on behalf of Israel. 
<p><a name="2172"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2172</font></u></a></b> God's action is the model for human action. If God "rested and was refreshed" on the seventh day, man too ought to "rest" and should let others, especially the poor, "be refreshed."<sup>96</sup> The sabbath brings everyday work to a halt and provides a respite. It is a day of protest against the servitude of work and the worship of money.<sup>97</sup>
<p><a name="2173"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2173</font></u></a></b> The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the sabbath law. But Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day.<sup>98</sup> He gives this law its authentic and authoritative interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath."<sup>99</sup> With compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.<sup>100</sup> The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God.<sup>101</sup> "The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath."<sup>102</sup>
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE LORD'S DAY</font></a></b>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>This is the day which the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.<sup>103</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2174"></a><b>The day of the Resurrection: the new creation</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2174</font></u></a></b> Jesus rose from the dead "on the first day of the week."<sup>104</sup> Because it is the "first day," the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the first creation. Because it is the "eighth day" following the sabbath,<sup>105</sup> it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (<i>he kuriake hemera, dies dominica</i>) Sunday: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead.<sup>106</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2175"></a><b>Sunday - fulfillment of the sabbath</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2175</font></u></a></b> Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some aspects of Christ:<sup>107</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Those who lived according to the old order of things have come to a new hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but the Lord's Day, in which our life is blessed by him and by his death.<sup>108</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2176"></a><b>2176</b> The celebration of Sunday observes the moral commandment inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward, visible, public, and regular worship "as a sign of his universal beneficence to all."<sup>109</sup> Sunday worship fulfills the moral command of the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people. 
<p><a name="2177"></a><b>The Sunday Eucharist</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2177</font></u></a></b> The Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the Church's life. "Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the universal Church."<sup>110</sup>
<p><span>"Also to be observed are the day of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Epiphany, the Ascension of Christ, the feast of the Body and Blood of Christi, the feast of Mary the Mother of God, her Immaculate Conception, her Assumption, the feast of Saint Joseph, the feast of the Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All Saints."<sup>111</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2178"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2178</font></u></a></b> This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the beginnings of the apostolic age.<sup>112</sup> The <i>Letter to the Hebrews</i> reminds the faithful "not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some, but to encourage one another."<sup>113</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhortation: Come to Church early, approach the Lord, and confess your sins, repent in prayer. . . . Be present at the sacred and divine liturgy, conclude its prayer and do not leave before the dismissal. . . . We have often said: "This day is given to you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it."<sup>114</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2179"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2179</font></u></a></b> "A <i>parish </i>is a definite community of the Christian faithful established on a stable basis within a particular church; the pastoral care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under the authority of the diocesan bishop."<sup>115</sup> It is the place where all the faithful can be gathered together for the Sunday celebration of the Eucharist. The parish initiates the Christian people into the ordinary expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together in this celebration; it teaches Christ's saving doctrine; it practices the charity of the Lord in good works and brotherly love: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great multitude, where exclamations are cried out to God as from one great heart, and where there is something more: the union of minds, the accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayers of the priests.<sup>116</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2180"></a><b>The Sunday obligation</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2180</font></u></a></b> The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more precisely: "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to participate in the Mass."<sup>117</sup> "The precept of participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the evening of the preceding day."<sup>118</sup>
<p><a name="2181"></a><b>2181</b> The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.<sup>119</sup> Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin. 
<p><a name="2182"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2182</font></u></a></b> Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ and to his Church. The faithful give witness by this to their communion in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness and their hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 
<p><a name="2183"></a><b>2183</b> <span>"If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is specially recommended that the faithful take part in the Liturgy of the Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place according to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in prayer for an appropriate amount of time personally or in a family or, as occasion offers, in groups of families."<sup>120</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2184"></a><b>A day of grace and rest from work</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2184</font></u></a></b> Just as God "rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done,"<sup>121</sup> human life has a rhythm of work and rest. The institution of the Lord's Day helps everyone enjoy adequate rest and leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.<sup>122</sup>
<p><a name="2185"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2185</font></u></a></b> On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, the performance of the works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.<sup>123</sup> Family needs or important social service can legitimately excuse from the obligation of Sunday rest. The faithful should see to it that legitimate excuses do not lead to habits prejudicial to religion, family life, and health. 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>The charity of truth seeks holy leisure- the necessity of charity accepts just work.<sup>124</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2186"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2186</font></u></a></b> Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of their brethren who have the same needs and the same rights, yet cannot rest from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is traditionally consecrated by Christian piety to good works and humble service of the sick, the infirm, and the elderly. Christians will also sanctify Sunday by devoting time and care to their families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life. 
<p><a name="2187"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2187</font></u></a></b> <span>Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort. Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day. Traditional activities (sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public services, etc.), require some people to work on Sundays, but everyone should still take care to set aside sufficient time for leisure. With temperance and charity the faithful will see to it that they avoid the excesses and violence sometimes associated with popular leisure activities. In spite of economic constraints, public authorities should ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine worship. Employers have a similar obligation toward their employees. </span>
<p><a name="2188"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2188</font></u></a></b> In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all, Christians should seek recognition of Sundays and the Church's holy days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public example of prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as a precious contribution to the spiritual life of society. If a country's legislation or other reasons require work on Sunday, the day should nevertheless be lived as the day of our deliverance which lets us share in this "festal gathering," this "assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven."<sup>125</sup>

<p><a name="2196"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2196</font></u></a></b> In response to the question about the first of the commandments, Jesus says: "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."<sup>2</sup>
<p>The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: "He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. The commandments, <i>'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,'</i> and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."<sup>3</sup>

<p>The Lord Jesus himself recalled the force of this "commandment of God."<sup>6</sup> The Apostle teaches: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

<p><a name="2197"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2197</font></u></a></b> The fourth commandment opens the second table of the Decalogue. It shows us the order of charity. God has willed that, after him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and who have handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged to honor and respect all those whom God, for our good, has vested with his authority. 
<p><a name="2198"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2198</font></u></a></b> This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be fulfilled. It introduces the subsequent commandments which are concerned with particular respect for life, marriage, earthly goods, and speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of the social doctrine of the Church. 
<p><a name="2199"></a><b>2199</b> The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to children in their relationship to their father and mother, because this relationship is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of kinship between members of the extended family. It requires honor, affection, and gratitude toward elders and ancestors. Finally, it extends to the duties of pupils to teachers, employees to employers, subordinates to leaders, citizens to their country, and to those who administer or govern it. 
<p>This commandment includes and presupposes the duties of parents, instructors, teachers, leaders, magistrates, those who govern, all who exercise authority over others or over a community of persons. 
<p><a name="2200"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2200</font></u></a></b> Observing the fourth commandment brings its reward: "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the LORD your God gives you."<sup>8</sup> Respecting this commandment provides, along with spiritual fruits, temporal fruits of peace and prosperity. Conversely, failure to observe it brings great harm to communities and to individuals. 
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. THE FAMILY IN GOD'S PLAN</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2201"></a><b>The nature of the family</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2201</font></u></a></b> The conjugal community is established upon the consent of the spouses. Marriage and the family are ordered to the good of the spouses and to the procreation and education of children. The love of the spouses and the begetting of children create among members of the same family personal relationships and primordial responsibilities. 
<p><a name="2202"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2202</font></u></a></b> A man and a woman united in marriage, together with their children, form a family. This institution is prior to any recognition by public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It should be considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of family relationship are to be evaluated. 
<p><a name="2203"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2203</font></u></a></b> In creating man and woman, God instituted the human family and endowed it with its fundamental constitution. Its members are persons equal in dignity. For the common good of its members and of society, the family necessarily has manifold responsibilities, rights, and duties. 
<p><a name="2204"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>The Christian family</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2204</font></u></a></b> "The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and realization of ecclesial communion, and for this reason it can and should be called a <i>domestic church</i>."<sup>9</sup> It is a community of faith, hope, and charity; it assumes singular importance in the Church, as is evident in the New Testament.<sup>10</sup>
<p><a name="2205"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2205</font></u></a></b> The Christian family is a communion of persons, a sign and image of the communion of the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit. In the procreation and education of children it reflects the Father's work of creation. It is called to partake of the prayer and sacrifice of Christ. Daily prayer and the reading of the Word of God strengthen it in charity. The Christian family has an evangelizing and missionary task. 
<p><a name="2206"></a><b>2206</b> The relationships within the family bring an affinity of feelings, affections and interests, arising above all from the members' respect for one another. The family is a <i>privileged community</i> called to achieve a "sharing of thought and common deliberation by the spouses as well as their eager cooperation as parents in the children's upbringing."<sup>11</sup>
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE FAMILY AND SOCIETY</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2207"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2207</font></u></a></b> The family is the <i>original cell of social life</i>. It is the natural society in which husband and wife are called to give themselves in love and in the gift of life. Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society. The family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society. 
<p><a name="2208"></a><b>2208</b> The family should live in such a way that its members learn to care and take responsibility for the young, the old, the sick, the handicapped, and the poor. There are many families who are at times incapable of providing this help. It devolves then on other persons, other families, and, in a subsidiary way, society to provide for their needs: "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world."<sup>12</sup>
<p><a name="2209"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2209</font></u></a></b> The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social measures. Where families cannot fulfill their responsibilities, other social bodies have the duty of helping them and of supporting the institution of the family. Following the principle of subsidiarity, larger communities should take care not to usurp the family's prerogatives or interfere in its life. 
<p><a name="2210"></a><b>2210</b> The importance of the family for the life and well-being of society<sup>13</sup> entails a particular responsibility for society to support and strengthen marriage and the family. Civil authority should consider it a grave duty "to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family, to protect and foster them, to safeguard public morality, and promote domestic prosperity."<sup>14</sup>
<p><a name="2211"></a><b>2211</b> <span>The political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist it, and to ensure especially: 
<p>- the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions; 
<p>- the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of the family; 
<p>- the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on, and raise one's children in it, with the necessary means and institutions; 
<p>- the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and housing, and the right to emigrate; 
<p>- in keeping with the country's institutions, the right to medical care, assistance for the aged, and family benefits; 
<p>- the protection of security and health, especially with respect to dangers like drugs, pornography, alcoholism, etc.; 
<p>- the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have representation before civil authority.<sup>15</sup> </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></span>
<p><a name="2212"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2212</font></u></a></b> The fourth commandment <i>illuminates other relationships in society</i>. In our brothers and sisters we see the children of our parents; in our cousins, the descendants of our ancestors; in our fellow citizens, the children of our country; in the baptized, the children of our mother the Church; in every human person, a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called "our Father." In this way our relationships with our neighbors are recognized as personal in character. The neighbor is not a "unit" in the human collective; he is "someone" who by his known origins deserves particular attention and respect. 
<p><a name="2213"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2213</font></u></a></b> Human communities are <i>made up of persons</i>. Governing them well is not limited to guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties such as honoring contracts. Right relations between employers and employees, between those who govern and citizens, presuppose a natural good will in keeping with the dignity of human persons concerned for justice and fraternity. 
<p><b><a name="III"><font color="#000000">III. THE DUTIES OF FAMILY MEMBERS</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2214"></a><b>The duties of children</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2214</font></u></a></b> The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood;<sup>16</sup> this is the foundation of the honor owed to parents. The respect of children, whether minors or adults, for their father and mother<sup>17</sup> is nourished by the natural affection born of the bond uniting them. It is required by God's commandment.<sup>18</sup>
<p><a name="2215"></a><b>2215</b> Respect for parents (<i>filial piety</i>) derives from <i>gratitude </i>toward those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom, and grace. "With all your heart honor your father, and do not forget the birth pangs of your mother. Remember that through your parents you were born; what can you give back to them that equals their gift to you?"<sup>19</sup>
<p><a name="2216"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2216</font></u></a></b> Filial respect is shown by true docility and <i>obedience</i>. "My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. . . . When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you."<sup>20</sup> "A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke."<sup>21</sup>
<p><a name="2217"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2217</font></u></a></b> <span>As long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should obey his parents in all that they ask of him when it is for his good or that of the family. "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."<sup>22</sup> Children should also obey the reasonable directions of their teachers and all to whom their parents have entrusted them. But if a child is convinced in conscience that it would be morally wrong to obey a particular order, he must not do so. 
<p>As they grow up, children should continue to respect their parents. They should anticipate their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and accept their just admonitions. Obedience toward parents ceases with the emancipation of the children; not so respect, which is always owed to them. This respect has its roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. </p></span>
<p><a name="2218"></a><b>2218</b> The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their <i>responsibilities toward their parents</i>. As much as they can, they must give them material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress. Jesus recalls this duty of gratitude.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he confirmed the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever honors his father atones for sins, and whoever glorifies his mother is like one who lays up treasure. Whoever honors his father will be gladdened by his own children, and when he prays he will be heard. Whoever glorifies his father will have long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his mother.<sup>24</sup>
<p>O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as long as he lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; in all your strength do not despise him. . . . Whoever forsakes his father is like a blasphemer, and whoever angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.<sup>25</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a name="2219"></a><b>2219</b> Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also concerns <i>relationships between brothers and sisters</i>. Respect toward parents fills the home with light and warmth. "Grandchildren are the crown of the aged."<sup>26</sup> "With all humility and meekness, with patience, [support] one another in charity."<sup>27</sup>
<p><a name="2220"></a><b>2220</b> For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom they have received the gift of faith, the grace of Baptism, and life in the Church. These may include parents, grandparents, other members of the family, pastors, catechists, and other teachers or friends. "I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you."<sup>28</sup>
<p><a name="2221"></a><b>The duties of parents</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2221</font></u></a></b> The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the procreation of children, but must extend to their moral education and their spiritual formation. "The <i>role of parents in education</i> is of such importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate substitute."<sup>29</sup> The right and the duty of parents to educate their children are primordial and inalienable.<sup>30</sup>
<p><a name="2211"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2222</font></u></a></b> Parents must regard their children as <i>children of God</i> and respect them as <i>human persons</i>. Showing themselves obedient to the will of the Father in heaven, they educate their children to fulfill God's law. 
<p><a name="2223"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2223</font></u></a></b> Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children. They bear witness to this responsibility first by <i>creating a home</i> where tenderness, forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and disinterested service are the rule. The home is well suited for <i>education in the virtues</i>. This requires an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and self-mastery - the preconditions of all true freedom. Parents should teach their children to subordinate the "material and instinctual dimensions to interior and spiritual ones."<sup>31</sup> Parents have a grave responsibility to give good example to their children. By knowing how to acknowledge their own failings to their children, parents will be better able to guide and correct them: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>He who loves his son will not spare the rod. . . . He who disciplines his son will profit by him.<sup>32</sup>
<p>Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.<sup>33</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a name="2224"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2224</font></u></a></b> The home is the natural environment for initiating a human being into solidarity and communal responsibilities. Parents should teach children to avoid the compromising and degrading influences which threaten human societies. 
<p><a name="2225"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2225</font></u></a></b> Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive the responsibility and privilege of <i>evangelizing their children</i>. Parents should initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the faith of which they are the "first heralds" for their children. They should associate them from their tenderest years with the life of the Church.<sup>34</sup> A wholesome family life can foster interior dispositions that are a genuine preparation for a living faith and remain a support for it throughout one's life. 
<p><a name="2226"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2226</font></u></a></b> <i>Education in the faith</i> by the parents should begin in the child's earliest years. This already happens when family members help one another to grow in faith by the witness of a Christian life in keeping with the Gospel. Family catechesis precedes, accompanies, and enriches other forms of instruction in the faith. Parents have the mission of teaching their children to pray and to discover their vocation as children of God.<sup>35</sup> The parish is the Eucharistic community and the heart of the liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents. 
<p><a name="2227"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2227</font></u></a></b> Children in turn contribute to the <i>growth in holiness</i> of their parents.<sup>36</sup> Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect. Mutual affection suggests this. The charity of Christ demands it.<sup>37</sup>
<p><a name="2228"></a><b>2228</b> Parents' respect and affection are expressed by the care and attention they devote to bringing up their young children and <i>providing for their physical and spiritual needs</i>. As the children grow up, the same respect and devotion lead parents to educate them in the right use of their reason and freedom. 
<p><a name="2229"></a><b>2229</b> As those first responsible for the education of their children, parents have the right to <i>choose a school for them</i> which corresponds to their own convictions. This right is fundamental. As far as possible parents have the duty of choosing schools that will best help them in their task as Christian educators.<sup>38</sup> Public authorities have the duty of guaranteeing this parental right and of ensuring the concrete conditions for its exercise. 
<p><a name="2230"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2230</font></u></a></b> When they become adults, children have the right and duty to <i>choose their profession and state of life</i>. They should assume their new responsibilities within a trusting relationship with their parents, willingly asking and receiving their advice and counsel. Parents should be careful not to exert pressure on their children either in the choice of a profession or in that of a spouse. This necessary restraint does not prevent them - quite the contrary from giving their children judicious advice, particularly when they are planning to start a family. 
<p><a name="2231"></a><b>2231</b> Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or brothers and sisters, to give themselves more completely to a profession, or to serve other honorable ends. They can contribute greatly to the good of the human family.

<p><a name="2232"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2232</font></u></a></b> Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child grows to maturity and human and spiritual autonomy, so his unique vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly and forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their children to follow it. They must be convinced that the first vocation of the Christian is to <i>follow </i>Jesus: "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."<sup>39</sup>
<p><a name="2233"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2233</font></u></a></b> Becoming a disciple of Jesus means accepting the invitation to belong to <i>God's family</i>, to live in conformity with His way of life: "For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother."<sup>40</sup>
<p>Parents should welcome and respect with joy and thanksgiving the Lord's call to one of their children to follow him in virginity for the sake of the Kingdom in the consecrated life or in priestly ministry.

<p><a name="2234"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2234</font></u></a></b> God's fourth commandment also enjoins us to honor all who for our good have received authority in society from God. It clarifies the duties of those who exercise authority as well as those who benefit from it. 
<p><a name="2235"></a><b>Duties of civil authorities</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2235</font></u></a></b> Those who exercise authority should do so as a service. "Whoever would be great among you must be your servant."<sup>41</sup> The exercise of authority is measured morally in terms of its divine origin, its reasonable nature and its specific object. No one can command or establish what is contrary to the dignity of persons and the natural law. 
<p><a name="2236"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2236</font></u></a></b> The exercise of authority is meant to give outward expression to a just hierarchy of values in order to facilitate the exercise of freedom and responsibility by all. Those in authority should practice distributive justice wisely, taking account of the needs and contribution of each, with a view to harmony and peace. They should take care that the regulations and measures they adopt are not a source of temptation by setting personal interest against that of the community.<sup>42</sup>
<p><a name="2237"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2237</font></u></a></b> <i>Political authorities</i> are obliged to respect the fundamental rights of the human person. They will dispense justice humanely by respecting the rights of everyone, especially of families and the disadvantaged. 
<p>The political rights attached to citizenship can and should be granted according to the requirements of the common good. They cannot be suspended by public authorities without legitimate and proportionate reasons. Political rights are meant to be exercised for the common good of the nation and the human community.

Live as free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live as servants of God."<sup>44</sup> Their loyal collaboration includes the right, and at times the duty, to voice their just criticisms of that which seems harmful to the dignity of persons and to the good of the community. 
<p><a name="2239"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2239</font></u></a></b> It is the <i>duty of citizens</i> to contribute along with the civil authorities to the good of society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidarity, and freedom. The love and service of <i>one's country</i> follow from the duty of gratitude and belong to the order of charity.

<p><span>Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the immigrants' duties toward their country of adoption.

<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2259"></a><b>The witness of sacred history</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2259</font></u></a></b> In the account of Abel's murder by his brother Cain,<sup>57</sup> Scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man, consequences of original sin, from the beginning of human history. Man has become the enemy of his fellow man. God declares the wickedness of this fratricide: "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand."<sup>58</sup>
<p><a name="2260"></a><b>2260</b> The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with reminders of God's gift of human life and man's murderous violence: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning. . . . Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image.<sup>59</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p>The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign of life.<sup>60</sup> This teaching remains necessary for all time. 
<p><a name="2261"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2261</font></u></a></b> Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous."<sup>61</sup> The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere. 
<p><a name="2262"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2262</font></u></a></b> In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, "You shall not kill,"<sup>62</sup> and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies.<sup>63</sup> He did not defend himself and told Peter to leave his sword in its sheath.<sup>64</sup>
<p><a name="2263"></a><b>Legitimate defense</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2263</font></u></a></b> The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an exception to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that constitutes intentional killing. "The act of self-defense can have a double effect: the preservation of one's own life; and the killing of the aggressor. . . . The one is intended, the other is not."<sup>65</sup>
<p><a name="2264"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2264</font></u></a></b> Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one's own right to life. Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>If a man in self-defense uses more than necessary violence, it will be unlawful: whereas if he repels force with moderation, his defense will be lawful. . . . Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of moderate self-defense to avoid killing the other man, since one is bound to take more care of one's own life than of another's.<sup>66</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2265"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2265</font></u></a></b> Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility. 
<p><a name="2266"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2266</font></u></a></b> The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to people's rights and to the basic rules of civil society correspond to the requirement of safeguarding the common good. Legitimate public authority has the right and duty to inflict punishment proportionate to the gravity of the offense. Punishment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense. When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of expiation. Punishment then, in addition to defending public order and protecting people's safety, has a medicinal purpose: as far as possible, it must contribute to the correction of the guilty party.<sup>67</sup>
<p><a name="2267"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2267</font></u></a></b> Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. 
<p>If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity to the dignity of the human person. 
<p>Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm - without definitely taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity "are very rare, if not practically nonexistent."<sup>68</sup>
<p><a name="2268"></a><b>Intentional homicide</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2268</font></u></a></b> The fifth commandment forbids <i>direct and intentional killing</i> as gravely sinful. The murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance.<sup>69</sup>
<p><span>Infanticide,<sup>70</sup> fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse are especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any murder, even if commanded by public authority. </span>
<p><a name="2269"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2269</font></u></a></b> The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the intention of <i>indirectly </i>bringing about a person's death. The moral law prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave reason, as well as refusing assistance to a person in danger. 
<p><span>The acceptance by human society of murderous famines, without efforts to remedy them, is a scandalous injustice and a grave offense. Those whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the hunger and death of their brethren in the human family indirectly commit homicide, which is imputable to them.<sup>71</sup> </span>
<p><i>Unintentional </i>killing is not morally imputable. But one is not exonerated from grave offense if, without proportionate reasons, he has acted in a way that brings about someone's death, even without the intention to do so. 
<p><a name="2270"></a><b>Abortion</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2270</font></u></a></b> Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.<sup>72</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.<sup>73</sup>
<p>My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.<sup>74</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a name="2271"></a><b>2271</b> Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish.<sup>75</sup>
<p>God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.<sup>76</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a name="2272"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2272</font></u></a></b> Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication <i>latae sententiae</i>,"<sup>77</sup> "by the very commission of the offense,"<sup>78</sup> and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law.<sup>79</sup> The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society. 
<p><a name="2273"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2273</font></u></a></b> The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a <i>constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation</i>: 
<p><span>"The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority. These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents; nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state; they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin. Among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard every human being's right to life and physical integrity from the moment of conception until death."<sup>80</sup>
<p>"The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them, the state is denying the equality of all before the law. When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined. . . . As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be ensured for the unborn child from the moment of conception, the law must provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the child's rights."<sup>81</sup> </p></span>
<p><a name="2274"></a><b>2274</b> Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. 
<p><span><i>Prenatal diagnosis</i> is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."<sup>82</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2275"></a><b>2275</b> <span>"One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it, but are directed toward its healing the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual survival."<sup>83</sup>
<p>"It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as disposable biological material."<sup>84</sup>
<p>"Certain attempts to <i>influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance </i>are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities. Such manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his integrity and identity"<sup>85</sup> which are unique and unrepeatable. </p></p></span>
<p><a name="2276"></a><b>Euthanasia</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2276</font></u></a></b> Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special respect. Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to lead lives as normal as possible. 
<p><a name="2277"></a><b>2277</b> Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying persons. It is morally unacceptable. 
<p><span>Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator. The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be forbidden and excluded. </span>
<p><a name="2278"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2278</font></u></a></b> <span>Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate; it is the refusal of "over-zealous" treatment. Here one does not will to cause death; one's inability to impede it is merely accepted. The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able or, if not, by those legally entitled to act for the patient, whose reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be respected. </span>
<p><a name="2279"></a><b>2279</b> <span>Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted. The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at the risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means, but only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity. As such it should be encouraged. </span>
<p><a name="2280"></a><b>Suicide</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2280</font></u></a></b> Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to him. It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life. We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us. It is not ours to dispose of. 
<p><a name="2281"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2281</font></u></a></b> Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God. 
<p><a name="2282"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2282</font></u></a></b> If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law. 
<p>Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide. 
<p><a name="2283"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2283</font></u></a></b> We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF PERSONS</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2284"></a><b>Respect for the souls of others: scandal</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2284</font></u></a></b> Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense. 
<p><a name="2285"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2285</font></u></a></b> Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."<sup>86</sup> Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep's clothing.<sup>87</sup>
<p><a name="2286"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2286</font></u></a></b> Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or opinion. 
<p><span>Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious practice, or to "social conditions that, intentionally or not, make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically impossible."<sup>88</sup> This is also true of business leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their children to anger,<sup>89</sup> or manipulators of public opinion who turn it away from moral values. </span>
<p><a name="2287"></a><b>2287</b> Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. "Temptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come!"<sup>90</sup>
<p><a name="2288"></a><b>Respect for health</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2288</font></u></a></b> Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by God. We must take reasonable care of them, taking into account the needs of others and the common good. 
<p><i>Concern for the health</i> of its citizens requires that society help in the attainment of living-conditions that allow them to grow and reach maturity: food and clothing, housing, health care, basic education, employment, and social assistance. 
<p><a name="2289"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2289</font></u></a></b> If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not make it an absolute value. It rejects a neo-pagan notion that tends to promote the <i>cult of the body</i>, to sacrifice everything for it's sake, to idolize physical perfection and success at sports. By its selective preference of the strong over the weak, such a conception can lead to the perversion of human relationships. 
<p><a name="2290"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2290</font></u></a></b> The virtue of temperance disposes us to <i>avoid every kind of excess</i>: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. 
<p><a name="2291"></a><b>2291</b> The <i>use of drugs</i> inflicts very grave damage on human health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense. Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs are scandalous practices. They constitute direct co-operation in evil, since they encourage people to practices gravely contrary to the moral law. 
<p><a name="2292"></a><b>Respect for the person and scientific research</b>
<p><b>2292</b> Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human individuals or groups can contribute to healing the sick and the advancement of public health. 
<p><a name="2293"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2293</font></u></a></b> <span>Basic scientific research, as well as applied research, is a significant expression of man's dominion over creation. Science and technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man and promote his integral development for the benefit of all. By themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress. Science and technology are ordered to man, from whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits. </span>
<p><a name="2294"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2294</font></u></a></b> <span>It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research and its applications. On the other hand, guiding principles cannot be inferred from simple technical efficiency, or from the usefulness accruing to some at the expense of others or, even worse, from prevailing ideologies. Science and technology by their very nature require unconditional respect for fundamental moral criteria. They must be at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, of his true and integral good, in conformity with the plan and the will of God. </span>
<p><a name="2295"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2295</font></u></a></b> Research or experimentation on the human being cannot legitimate acts that are in themselves contrary to the dignity of persons and to the moral law. The subjects' potential consent does not justify such acts. Experimentation on human beings is not morally legitimate if it exposes the subject's life or physical and psychological integrity to disproportionate or avoidable risks. Experimentation on human beings does not conform to the dignity of the person if it takes place without the informed consent of the subject or those who legitimately speak for him. 
<p><a name="2296"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2296</font></u></a></b> <span><i>Organ transplants</i> are in conformity with the moral law if the physical and psychological dangers and risks to the donor are proportionate to the good sought for the recipient. Organ donation after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as a expression of generous solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the donor or his proxy has not given explicit consent. Moreover, it is not morally admissible to bring about the disabling mutilation or death of a human being, even in order to delay the death of other persons. </span>

<p><b>2297</b> <i>Kidnapping </i>and <i>hostage taking</i> bring on a reign of terror; by means of threats they subject their victims to intolerable pressures. They are morally wrong. <i>Terrorism </i>threatens, wounds, and kills indiscriminately; it is gravely against justice and charity. <i>Torture </i>which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity.

Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. </span>

<p><i>Anger </i>is a desire for revenge. "To desire vengeance in order to do evil to someone who should be punished is illicit," but it is praiseworthy to impose restitution "to correct vices and maintain justice."<sup>95</sup> If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin. The Lord says, "Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment."<sup>96</sup>
<p><a name="2303"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2303</font></u></a></b> Deliberate <i>hatred </i>is contrary to charity.

Peace is not merely the absence of war, and it is not limited to maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries. Peace cannot be attained on earth without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication among men, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is "the tranquillity of order."<sup>98</sup> Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity.<sup>99</sup>

They bear legitimate witness to the gravity of the physical and moral risks of recourse to violence, with all its destruction and death.<sup>104</sup>
<p><a name="2307"></a><b>Avoiding war</b>
<p><b>2307</b> The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of human life. Because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war, the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war.<sup>105</sup>
<p><a name="2308"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2308</font></u></a></b> All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war. 
<p>However, "as long as the danger of war persists and there is no international authority with the necessary competence and power, governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed."<sup>106</sup>
<p><a name="2309"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2309</font></u></a></b> The strict conditions for <i>legitimate defense by military force</i> require rigorous consideration. The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same time: 
<p>- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain; 
<p>- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective; 
<p>- there must be serious prospects of success; 
<p>- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modem means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition. 
<p><span>These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the "just war" doctrine.<br /></span>
<p>The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good. 
<p><a name="2310"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2310</font></u></a></b> Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose on citizens the <i>obligations necessary for national defense</i>.

<p><a name="2311"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2311</font></u></a></b> Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms; these are nonetheless obliged to serve the human community in some other way.<sup>108</sup>
<p><a name="2312"></a><b>2312</b> The Church and human reason both assert the permanent validity of the <i>moral law during armed conflict</i>. "The mere fact that war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything becomes licit between the warring parties."<sup>109</sup>
<p><a name="2313"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2313</font></u></a></b> Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be respected and treated humanely. 
<p>Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out. Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that command genocide. 
<p><a name="2314"></a><b>2314</b> "Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation."<sup>110</sup> A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic, biological, or chemical weapons - to commit such crimes. 
<p><a name="2315"></a><b>2315</b> The <i>accumulation of arms</i> strikes many as a paradoxically suitable way of deterring potential adversaries from war. They see it as the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations. This method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations. The <i>arms race</i> does not ensure peace. Far from eliminating the causes of war, it risks aggravating them. Spending enormous sums to produce ever new types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy populations;<sup>111</sup> it thwarts the development of peoples. <i>Over-armament</i> multiplies reasons for conflict and increases the danger of escalation.

God inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the <i>vocation</i>, and thus the capacity and responsibility, <i>of love</i> and communion."<sup>115</sup>
<p>"God created man in his own image . . . male and female he created them";<sup>116</sup> He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply";<sup>117</sup> "When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created."<sup>118</sup>
<p><a name="2332"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2332</font></u></a></b> <i>Sexuality </i>affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others. 
<p><a name="2333"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2333</font></u></a></b> Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual <i>identity</i>. Physical, moral, and spiritual <i>difference </i>and <i>complementarity </i>are oriented toward the goods of marriage and the flourishing of family life. The harmony of the couple and of society depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs, and mutual support between the sexes are lived out. 
<p><a name="2334"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2334</font></u></a></b> "In creating men 'male and female,' God gives man and woman an equal personal dignity."<sup>119</sup> "Man is a person, man and woman equally so, since both were created in the image and likeness of the personal God."<sup>120</sup>
<p><a name="2335"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2335</font></u></a></b> Each of the two sexes is an image of the power and tenderness of God, with equal dignity though in a different way.

<p><a name="2336"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2336</font></u></a></b> Jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins.

But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."<sup>123</sup> What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.<sup>124</sup>
<p>The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment as encompassing the whole of human sexuality. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE VOCATION TO CHASTITY</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2337"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2337</font></u></a></b> Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being. Sexuality, in which man's belonging to the bodily and biological world is expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is integrated into the relationship of one person to another, in the complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman. 
<p>The virtue of chastity therefore involves the integrity of the person and the integrality of the gift. 
<p><a name="2338"></a><b>The integrity of the person</b>
<p><b>2338</b> The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the person; it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It tolerates neither a double life nor duplicity in speech.<sup>125</sup>
<p><a name="2339"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2339</font></u></a></b> Chastity includes an <i>apprenticeship in self-mastery</i> which is a training in human freedom. The alternative is clear: either man governs his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be dominated by them and becomes unhappy.<sup>126</sup> "Man's dignity therefore requires him to act out of conscious and free choice, as moved and drawn in a personal way from within, and not by blind impulses in himself or by mere external constraint. Man gains such dignity when, ridding himself of all slavery to the passions, he presses forward to his goal by freely choosing what is good and, by his diligence and skill, effectively secures for himself the means suited to this end."<sup>127</sup>
<p><a name="2340"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2340</font></u></a></b> Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal promises and resist temptations will want to adopt the means for doing so: self-knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations that confront him, obedience to God's commandments, exercise of the moral virtues, and fidelity to prayer. "Indeed it is through chastity that we are gathered together and led back to the unity from which we were fragmented into multiplicity."<sup>128</sup>
<p><a name="2341"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2341</font></u></a></b> The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of <i>temperance</i>, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the senses with reason. 
<p><a name="2342"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2342</font></u></a></b> Self-mastery is a<i> long and exacting work</i>. One can never consider it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all stages of life.<sup>129</sup> The effort required can be more intense in certain periods, such as when the personality is being formed during childhood and adolescence. 
<p><a name="2343"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2343</font></u></a></b> Chastity has <i>laws of growth</i> which progress through stages marked by imperfection and too often by sin. "Man . . . day by day builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows, loves, and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth."<sup>130</sup>
<p><a name="2344"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2344</font></u></a></b> Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also involves a <i>cultural effort</i>, for there is "an interdependence between personal betterment and the improvement of society."<sup>131</sup> Chastity presupposes respect for the rights of the person, in particular the right to receive information and an education that respect the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life. 
<p><a name="2345"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2345</font></u></a></b> Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, a <i>grace</i>, a fruit of spiritual effort.<sup>132</sup> The Holy Spirit enables one whom the water of Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of Christ.<sup>133</sup>
<p><a name="2346"></a><b>The integrality of the gift of self</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2346</font></u></a></b> Charity is the <i>form </i>of all the virtues. Under its influence, chastity appears as a school of the gift of the person. Self-mastery is ordered to the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to become a witness to his neighbor of God's fidelity and loving kindness. 
<p><a name="2347"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2347</font></u></a></b> The virtue of chastity blossoms in <i>friendship</i>. It shows the disciple how to follow and imitate him who has chosen us as his friends,<sup>134</sup> who has given himself totally to us and allows us to participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality. 
<p>Chastity is expressed notably in <i>friendship with one's neighbor</i>. Whether it develops between persons of the same or opposite sex, friendship represents a great good for all. It leads to spiritual communion. 
<p><a name="2348"></a><b>The various forms of chastity</b>
<p><b>2348</b> All the baptized are called to chastity. The Christian has "put on Christ,"<sup>135</sup> the model for all chastity. All Christ's faithful are called to lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states of life. At the moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to lead his affective life in chastity. 
<p><a name="2349"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2349</font></u></a></b> "People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited to their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the moral law, whether they are married or single."<sup>136</sup> Married people are called to live conjugal chastity; others practice chastity in continence:

<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2351</font></u></a></b> <i>Lust </i>is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure. Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes. 
<p><a name="2352"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2352</font></u></a></b> By <i>masturbation </i>is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. "Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action."<sup>138</sup> "The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose." For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved."<sup>139</sup>
<p>To form an equitable judgment about the subjects' moral responsibility and to guide pastoral action, one must take into account the affective immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety or other psychological or social factors that lessen, if not even reduce to a minimum, moral culpability. 
<p><a name="2353"></a><b>2353</b> <i>Fornication </i>is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children.

<p><a name="2354"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2354</font></u></a></b> <i>Pornography </i>consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials. 
<p><a name="2355"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2355</font></u></a></b> <i>Prostitution </i>does injury to the dignity of the person who engages in it, reducing the person to an instrument of sexual pleasure. The one who pays sins gravely against himself: he violates the chastity to which his Baptism pledged him and defiles his body, the temple of the Holy Spirit.<sup>140</sup> Prostitution is a social scourge. It usually involves women, but also men, children, and adolescents (The latter two cases involve the added sin of scandal.). While it is always gravely sinful to engage in prostitution, the imputability of the offense can be attenuated by destitution, blackmail, or social pressure. 
<p><a name="2356"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2356</font></u></a></b> <i>Rape </i>is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by parents (incest) or those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them. 
<p><a name="2357"></a><b>Chastity and homosexuality</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2357</font></u></a></b> Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,<sup>141</sup> tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."<sup>142</sup> They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. 
<p><a name="2358"></a><b>2358</b> The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition. 
<p><a name="2359"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2359</font></u></a></b> Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.

You made Adam, and for him you made his wife Eve as a helper and support. From the two of them the race of mankind has sprung.

<p><a name="2363"></a><b>2363</b> The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family. 
<p>The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and fecundity. 
<p><a name="2364"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>Conjugal fidelity</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2364</font></u></a></b> The married couple forms "the intimate partnership of life and love established by the Creator and governed by his laws; it is rooted in the conjugal covenant, that is, in their irrevocable personal consent."<sup>147</sup> Both give themselves definitively and totally to one another. They are no longer two; from now on they form one flesh. The covenant they freely contracted imposes on the spouses the obligation to preserve it as unique and indissoluble.<sup>148</sup> "What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."<sup>149</sup>
<p><a name="2365"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2365</font></u></a></b> Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one's given word. God is faithful.

<p><a name="2366"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b>The fecundity of marriage</b>
<p><b>2366</b> Fecundity is a gift, an <i>end of marriage</i>, for conjugal love naturally tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, which is "on the side of life,"<sup>151</sup> teaches that "it is necessary that each and every marriage act remain ordered <i>per se</i> to the procreation of human life."<sup>152</sup> "This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act."<sup>153</sup>
<p><a name="2367"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2367</font></u></a></b> Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and fatherhood of God.<sup>154</sup> "Married couples should regard it as their proper mission to transmit human life and to educate their children; they should realize that they are thereby <i>cooperating with</i> the love of <i>God the Creator</i> and are, in a certain sense, its interpreters. They will fulfill this duty with a sense of human and Christian responsibility."<sup>155</sup>
<p><a name="2368"></a><b>2368</b> A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the <i>regulation of procreation</i>. For just reasons, spouses may wish to space the births of their children. It is their duty to make certain that their desire is not motivated by selfishness but is in conformity with the generosity appropriate to responsible parenthood. Moreover, they should conform their behavior to the objective criteria of morality: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>When it is a question of harmonizing married love with the responsible transmission of life, the morality of the behavior does not depend on sincere intention and evaluation of motives alone; but it must be determined by objective criteria, criteria drawn from the nature of the person and his acts criteria that respect the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love; this is possible only if the virtue of married chastity is practiced with sincerity of heart.<sup>156</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2369"></a><b>2369</b> "By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted vocation to parenthood."<sup>157</sup>
<p><a name="2370"></a><b>2370</b> Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the objective criteria of morality.<sup>158</sup> These methods respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, and favor the education of an authentic freedom. In contrast, "every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible" is intrinsically evil:<sup>159</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving of husband and wife is overlaid, through contraception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not giving oneself totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive refusal to be open to life but also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love, which is called upon to give itself in personal totality. . . . The difference, both anthropological and moral, between contraception and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in the final analysis two irreconcilable concepts of the human person and of human sexuality.<sup>160</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2371"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2371</font></u></a></b> "Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of transmitting it are not limited by the horizons of this life only: their true evaluation and full significance can be understood only in reference to <i>man's eternal destiny</i>."<sup>161</sup>
<p><a name="2372"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2372</font></u></a></b> <span>The state has a responsibility for its citizens' well-being. In this capacity it is legitimate for it to intervene to orient the demography of the population. This can be done by means of objective and respectful information, but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. The state may not legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the primary responsibility for the procreation and education of their children.<sup>162</sup> In this area, it is not authorized to employ means contrary to the moral law. </span>
<p><a name="2373"></a><b>The gift of a child</b>
<p><b>2373</b> Sacred Scripture and the Church's traditional practice see in <i>large families</i> a sign of God's blessing and the parents' generosity.<sup>163</sup>
<p><a name="2374"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2374</font></u></a></b> Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly. "What will you give me," asks Abraham of God, "for I continue childless?"<sup>164</sup> And Rachel cries to her husband Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall die!"<sup>165</sup>
<p><a name="2375"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2375</font></u></a></b> Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged, on condition that it is placed "at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good according to the design and will of God."<sup>166</sup>
<p><a name="2376"></a><b>2376</b> <span>Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques (heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the child's right to be born of a father and mother known to him and bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses' "right to become a father and a mother only through each other."<sup>167</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2377"></a><b>2377</b> <span>Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children."<sup>168</sup> "Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses' union . . . . Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person."<sup>169</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2378"></a><b>2378</b> A child is not something <i>owed </i>to one, but is a <i>gift</i>. The "supreme gift of marriage" is a human person. A child may not be considered a piece of property, an idea to which an alleged "right to a child" would lead. In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right "to be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents," and "the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his conception."<sup>170</sup>
<p><a name="2379"></a><b>2379</b> The Gospel shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. Spouses who still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate medical procedures should unite themselves with the Lord's Cross, the source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their generosity by adopting abandoned children or performing demanding services for others. 
<p><b><a name="IV"><font color="#000000">IV. OFFENSES AGAINST THE DIGNITY OF MARRIAGE</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2380"></a><b>Adultery</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2380</font></u></a></b> <i>Adultery </i>refers to marital infidelity. When two partners, of whom at least one is married to another party, have sexual relations - even transient ones - they commit adultery. Christ condemns even adultery of mere desire.<sup>171</sup> The sixth commandment and the New Testament forbid adultery absolutely.<sup>172</sup> The prophets denounce the gravity of adultery; they see it as an image of the sin of idolatry.<sup>173</sup>
<p><a name="2381"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2381</font></u></a></b> Adultery is an injustice. He who commits adultery fails in his commitment. He does injury to the sign of the covenant which the marriage bond is, transgresses the rights of the other spouse, and undermines the institution of marriage by breaking the contract on which it is based. He compromises the good of human generation and the welfare of children who need their parents' stable union. 
<p><a name="2382"></a><b>Divorce</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2382</font></u></a></b> The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the Creator who willed that marriage be indissoluble.<sup>174</sup> He abrogates the accommodations that had slipped into the old Law.<sup>175</sup>
<p>Between the baptized, "a ratified and consummated marriage cannot be dissolved by any human power or for any reason other than death."<sup>176</sup>
<p><a name="2383"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2383</font></u></a></b> The <i>separation </i>of spouses while maintaining the marriage bond can be legitimate in certain cases provided for by canon law.<sup>177</sup>
<p><span>If civil divorce remains the only possible way of ensuring certain legal rights, the care of the children, or the protection of inheritance, it can be tolerated and does not constitute a moral offense. </span>
<p><a name="2384"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2384</font></u></a></b> <i>Divorce </i>is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to break the contract, to which the spouses freely consented, to live with each other till death. Divorce does injury to the covenant of salvation, of which sacramental marriage is the sign. Contracting a new union, even if it is recognized by civil law, adds to the gravity of the rupture: the remarried spouse is then in a situation of public and permanent adultery: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>If a husband, separated from his wife, approaches another woman, he is an adulterer because he makes that woman commit adultery, and the woman who lives with him is an adulteress, because she has drawn another's husband to herself.<sup>178</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2385"></a><b>2385</b> Divorce is immoral also because it introduces disorder into the family and into society. This disorder brings grave harm to the deserted spouse, to children traumatized by the separation of their parents and often torn between them, and because of its contagious effect which makes it truly a plague on society. 
<p><a name="2386"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2386</font></u></a></b> It can happen that one of the spouses is the innocent victim of a divorce decreed by civil law; this spouse therefore has not contravened the moral law. There is a considerable difference between a spouse who has sincerely tried to be faithful to the sacrament of marriage and is unjustly abandoned, and one who through his own grave fault destroys a canonically valid marriage.<sup>179</sup>
<p><a name="2387"></a><b>Other offenses against the dignity of marriage</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2387</font></u></a></b> The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he has shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However <i>polygamy </i>is not in accord with the moral law." [Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God which was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive."<sup>180</sup> The Christian who has previously lived in polygamy has a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in regard to his former wives and his children. 
<p><a name="2388"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2388</font></u></a></b> <i>Incest </i>designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws within a degree that prohibits marriage between them.<sup>181</sup> St. Paul stigmatizes this especially grave offense: "It is actually reported that there is immorality among you . . . for a man is living with his father's wife. . . . In the name of the Lord Jesus . . . you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh. . . . "<sup>182</sup> Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward animality. 
<p><a name="2389"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2389</font></u></a></b> Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care. The offense is compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and moral integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and the violation of responsibility for their upbringing. 
<p><a name="2390"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2390</font></u></a></b> In a so-called <i>free union</i>, a man and a woman refuse to give juridical and public form to a liaison involving sexual intimacy. 
<p><span>The expression "free union" is fallacious: what can "union" mean when the partners make no commitment to one another, each exhibiting a lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future? </span>
<p>The expression covers a number of different situations: concubinage, rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term commitments.<sup>183</sup> All these situations offend against the dignity of marriage; they destroy the very idea of the family; they weaken the sense of fidelity. They are contrary to the moral law. The sexual act must take place exclusively within marriage. Outside of marriage it always constitutes a grave sin and excludes one from sacramental communion. 
<p><a name="2391"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2391</font></u></a></b> Some today claim a <i>"right to a trial marriage"</i> where there is an intention of getting married later. However firm the purpose of those who engage in premature sexual relations may be, "the fact is that such liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and fidelity in a relationship between a man and a woman, nor, especially, can they protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim."<sup>184</sup> Carnal union is morally legitimate only when a definitive community of life between a man and woman has been established. Human love does not tolerate "trial marriages." It demands a total and definitive gift of persons to one another.<sup>185</sup>

<p><a name="2401"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2401</font></u></a></b> The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care of earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goods and respect for the right to private property. Christian life strives to order this world's goods to God and to fraternal charity. 
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. THE UNIVERSAL DESTINATION AND THE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF GOODS</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2402"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2402</font></u></a></b> In the beginning God entrusted the earth and its resources to the common stewardship of mankind to take care of them, master them by labor, and enjoy their fruits.<sup>187</sup> The goods of creation are destined for the whole human race. However, the earth is divided up among men to assure the security of their lives, endangered by poverty and threatened by violence. The appropriation of property is legitimate for guaranteeing the freedom and dignity of persons and for helping each of them to meet his basic needs and the needs of those in his charge. It should allow for a natural solidarity to develop between men. 
<p><a name="2403"></a><b>2403</b> The <i>right to private property</i>, acquired or received in a just way, does not do away with the original gift of the earth to the whole of mankind. The <i>universal destination of goods</i> remains primordial, even if the promotion of the common good requires respect for the right to private property and its exercise. 
<p><a name="2404"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2404</font></u></a></b> "In his use of things man should regard the external goods he legitimately owns not merely as exclusive to himself but common to others also, in the sense that they can benefit others as well as himself."<sup>188</sup> The ownership of any property makes its holder a steward of Providence, with the task of making it fruitful and communicating its benefits to others, first of all his family. 
<p><a name="2405"></a><b>2405</b> <span>Goods of production - material or immaterial - such as land, factories, practical or artistic skills, oblige their possessors to employ them in ways that will benefit the greatest number. Those who hold goods for use and consumption should use them with moderation, reserving the better part for guests, for the sick and the poor. </span>
<p><a name="2406"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2406</font></u></a></b> <i>Political authority</i> has the right and duty to regulate the legitimate exercise of the right to ownership for the sake of the common good.<sup>189</sup>
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. RESPECT FOR PERSONS AND THEIR GOODS</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2407"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2407</font></u></a></b> In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires the practice of the virtue of <i>temperance</i>, so as to moderate attachment to this world's goods; the practice of the virtue of <i>justice</i>, to preserve our neighbor's rights and render him what is his due; and the practice of <i>solidarity</i>, in accordance with the golden rule and in keeping with the generosity of the Lord, who "though he was rich, yet for your sake . . . became poor so that by his poverty, you might become rich."<sup>190</sup>
<p><a name="2408"></a><b>Respect for the goods of others</b>
<p><b>2408</b> The seventh commandment forbids <i>theft</i>, that is, usurping another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There is no theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to reason and the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and urgent necessity when the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at one's disposal and use the property of others.<sup>191</sup>
<p><a name="2409"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2409</font></u></a></b> Even if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another.<sup>192</sup>
<p><span>The following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation. </span>
<p><a name="2410"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2410</font></u></a></b> <i>Promises </i>must be kept and <i>contracts </i>strictly observed to the extent that the commitments made in them are morally just. A significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed to and executed in good faith. 
<p><a name="2411"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2411</font></u></a></b> Contracts are subject to <i>commutative justice</i> which regulates exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible. 
<p><span>One distinguishes <i>commutative </i>justice from <i>legal </i>justice which concerns what the citizen owes in fairness to the community, and from <i>distributive </i>justice which regulates what the community owes its citizens in proportion to their contributions and needs. </span>
<p><a name="2412"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2412</font></u></a></b> In virtue of commutative justice, <i>reparation for injustice</i> committed requires the restitution of stolen goods to their owner: 
<p><span>Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: "If I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold."<sup>193</sup> Those who, directly or indirectly, have taken possession of the goods of another, are obliged to make restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money, if the goods have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their owner would have legitimately obtained from them. Likewise, all who in some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly benefited from it - for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or received the stolen goods - are obliged to make restitution in proportion to their responsibility and to their share of what was stolen. </span>
<p><a name="2413"></a><b>2413</b> <span><i>Games of chance</i> (card games, etc.) or <i>wagers </i>are not in themselves contrary to justice. They become morally unacceptable when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his needs and those of others. The passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement. Unfair wagers and cheating at games constitute grave matter, unless the damage inflicted is so slight that the one who suffers it cannot reasonably consider it significant. </span>
<p><a name="2414"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2414</font></u></a></b> The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that for any reason - selfish or ideological, commercial, or totalitarian - lead to the <i>enslavement of human beings</i>, to their being bought, sold and exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal dignity. It is a sin against the dignity of persons and their fundamental rights to reduce them by violence to their productive value or to a source of profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat his Christian slave "no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, . . . both in the flesh and in the Lord."<sup>194</sup>
<p><a name="2415"></a><b>Respect for the integrity of creation</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2415</font></u></a></b> The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.<sup>195</sup> Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.<sup>196</sup>
<p><a name="2416"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2416</font></u></a></b> <i>Animals </i>are God's creatures. He surrounds them with his providential care. By their mere existence they bless him and give him glory.<sup>197</sup> Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri treated animals. 
<p><a name="2417"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2417</font></u></a></b> God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom he created in his own image.<sup>198</sup> Hence it is legitimate to use animals for food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man in his work and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on animals is a morally acceptable practice if it remains within reasonable limits and contributes to caring for or saving human lives. 
<p><a name="2418"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2418</font></u></a></b> It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly. It is likewise unworthy to spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can love animals; one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons. 
<p><b><a name="III"><font color="#000000">III. THE SOCIAL DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2419"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2419</font></u></a></b> "Christian revelation . . . promotes deeper understanding of the laws of social living."<sup>199</sup> The Church receives from the Gospel the full revelation of the truth about man. When she fulfills her mission of proclaiming the Gospel, she bears witness to man, in the name of Christ, to his dignity and his vocation to the communion of persons. She teaches him the demands of justice and peace in conformity with divine wisdom. 
<p><a name="2420"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2420</font></u></a></b> The Church makes a moral judgment about economic and social matters, "when the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of souls requires it."<sup>200</sup> In the moral order she bears a mission distinct from that of political authorities: the Church is concerned with the temporal aspects of the common good because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, our ultimate end. She strives to inspire right attitudes with respect to earthly goods and in socio-economic relationships. 
<p><a name="2421"></a><b>2421</b> <span>The social doctrine of the Church developed in the nineteenth century when the Gospel encountered modern industrial society with its new structures for the production of consumer goods, its new concept of society, the state and authority, and its new forms of labor and ownership. The development of the doctrine of the Church on economic and social matters attests the permanent value of the Church's teaching at the same time as it attests the true meaning of her Tradition, always living and active.<sup>201</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2422"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2422</font></u></a></b> The Church's social teaching comprises a body of doctrine, which is articulated as the Church interprets events in the course of history, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the whole of what has been revealed by Jesus Christ.<sup>202</sup> This teaching can be more easily accepted by men of good will, the more the faithful let themselves be guided by it. 
<p><a name="2423"></a><b>2423</b> The Church's social teaching proposes principles for reflection; it provides criteria for judgment; it gives guidelines for action: 
<p><span>Any system in which social relationships are determined entirely by economic factors is contrary to the nature of the human person and his acts.<sup>203</sup> </span>
<p><a name="2424"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2424</font></u></a></b> <span>A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of the many conflicts which disturb the social order.<sup>204</sup>
<p>A system that "subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of groups to the collective organization of production" is contrary to human dignity.<sup>205</sup> Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and contributes to the spread of atheism. "You cannot serve God and mammon."<sup>206</sup> </p></span>
<p><a name="2425"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2425</font></u></a></b> <span>The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies associated in modem times with "communism" or "socialism." She has likewise refused to accept, in the practice of "capitalism," individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human labor.<sup>207</sup> Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace fails social justice, for "there are many human needs which cannot be satisfied by the market."<sup>208</sup> Reasonable regulation of the marketplace and economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy of values and a view to the common good, is to be commended. </span>
<p><b><a name="IV"><font color="#000000">IV. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2426"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2426</font></u></a></b> The development of economic activity and growth in production are meant to provide for the needs of human beings. Economic life is not meant solely to multiply goods produced and increase profit or power; it is ordered first of all to the service of persons, of the whole man, and of the entire human community. Economic activity, conducted according to its own proper methods, is to be exercised within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social justice so as to correspond to God's plan for man.<sup>209</sup>
<p><a name="2427"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2427</font></u></a></b> <i>Human work</i> proceeds directly from persons created in the image of God and called to prolong the work of creation by subduing the earth, both with and for one another.<sup>210</sup> Hence work is a duty: "If any one will not work, let him not eat."<sup>211</sup> Work honors the Creator's gifts and the talents received from him. It can also be redemptive. By enduring the hardship of work<sup>212</sup> in union with Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth and the one crucified on Calvary, man collaborates in a certain fashion with the Son of God in his redemptive work. He shows himself to be a disciple of Christ by carrying the cross, daily, in the work he is called to accomplish.<sup>213</sup> Work can be a means of sanctification and a way of animating earthly realities with the Spirit of Christ. 
<p><a name="2428"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2428</font></u></a></b> In work, the person exercises and fulfills in part the potential inscribed in his nature. The primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author and its beneficiary. Work is for man, not man for work.<sup>214</sup>
<p>Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of providing for his life and that of his family, and of serving the human community. 
<p><a name="2429"></a><b>2429</b> Everyone has the <i>right of economic initiative</i>; everyone should make legitimate use of his talents to contribute to the abundance that will benefit all and to harvest the just fruits of his labor. He should seek to observe regulations issued by legitimate authority for the sake of the common good.<sup>215</sup>
<p><a name="2430"></a><b>2430</b> <i>Economic life</i> brings into play different interests, often opposed to one another. This explains why the conflicts that characterize it arise.<sup>216</sup> Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts by negotiation that respects the rights and duties of each social partner: those responsible for business enterprises, representatives of wage- earners (for example, trade unions), and public authorities when appropriate. 
<p><a name="2431"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2431</font></u></a></b> The <i>responsibility of the state</i>. "Economic activity, especially the activity of a market economy, cannot be conducted in an institutional, juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it presupposes sure guarantees of individual freedom and private property, as well as a stable currency and efficient public services. Hence the principal task of the state is to guarantee this security, so that those who work and produce can enjoy the fruits of their labors and thus feel encouraged to work efficiently and honestly. . . . Another task of the state is that of overseeing and directing the exercise of human rights in the economic sector. However, primary responsibility in this area belongs not to the state but to individuals and to the various groups and associations which make up society."<sup>217</sup>
<p><a name="2432"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2432</font></u></a></b> Those <i>responsible for business enterprises</i> are responsible to society for the economic and ecological effects of their operations.<sup>218</sup> They have an obligation to consider the good of persons and not only the increase of profits. Profits are necessary, however. They make possible the investments that ensure the future of a business and they guarantee employment. 
<p><a name="2433"></a><b>2433</b> <i>Access to employment</i> and to professions must be open to all without unjust discrimination: men and women, healthy and disabled, natives and immigrants.<sup>219</sup> For its part society should, according to circumstances, help citizens find work and employment.<sup>220</sup>
<p><a name="2434"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2434</font></u></a></b> A<i> just wage</i> is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold it can be a grave injustice.<sup>221</sup> In determining fair pay both the needs and the contributions of each person must be taken into account. "Remuneration for work should guarantee man the opportunity to provide a dignified livelihood for himself and his family on the material, social, cultural and spiritual level, taking into account the role and the productivity of each, the state of the business, and the common good."<sup>222</sup> Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to justify morally the amount to be received in wages. 
<p><a name="2435"></a><b>2435</b> Recourse to a <i>strike </i>is morally legitimate when it cannot be avoided, or at least when it is necessary to obtain a proportionate benefit. It becomes morally unacceptable when accompanied by violence, or when objectives are included that are not directly linked to working conditions or are contrary to the common good. 
<p><a name="2436"></a><b>2436</b> It is unjust not to pay the social security contributions required by legitimate authority. 
<p><i>Unemployment </i>almost always wounds its victim's dignity and threatens the equilibrium of his life. Besides the harm done to him personally, it entails many risks for his family.<sup>223</sup>
<p><b><a name="V"><font color="#000000">V. JUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2437"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2437</font></u></a></b> On the international level, inequality of resources and economic capability is such that it creates a real "gap" between nations.<sup>224</sup> On the one side there are those nations possessing and developing the means of growth and, on the other, those accumulating debts. 
<p><a name="2438"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2438</font></u></a></b> Various causes of a religious, political, economic, and financial nature today give "the social question a worldwide dimension."<sup>225</sup> There must be solidarity among nations which are already politically interdependent. It is even more essential when it is a question of dismantling the "perverse mechanisms" that impede the development of the less advanced countries.<sup>226</sup> In place of abusive if not usurious financial systems, iniquitous commercial relations among nations, and the arms race, there must be substituted a common effort to mobilize resources toward objectives of moral, cultural, and economic development, "redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values."<sup>227</sup>
<p><a name="2439"></a><b>2439</b> <i>Rich nations</i> have a grave moral responsibility toward those which are unable to ensure the means of their development by themselves or have been prevented from doing so by tragic historical events. It is a duty in solidarity and charity; it is also an obligation in justice if the prosperity of the rich nations has come from resources that have not been paid for fairly. 
<p><a name="2440"></a><b>2440</b> <i>Direct aid</i> is an appropriate response to immediate, extraordinary needs caused by natural catastrophes, epidemics, and the like. But it does not suffice to repair the grave damage resulting from destitution or to provide a lasting solution to a country's needs. It is also necessary to <i>reform </i>international economic and financial <i>institutions </i>so that they will better promote equitable relationships with less advanced countries.<sup>228</sup> The efforts of poor countries working for growth and liberation must be supported.<sup>229</sup> This doctrine must be applied especially in the area of agricultural labor. Peasants, especially in the Third World, form the overwhelming majority of the poor. 
<p><a name="2441"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2441</font></u></a></b> An increased sense of God and increased self-awareness are fundamental to any <i>full development of human society</i>. This development multiplies material goods and puts them at the service of the person and his freedom. It reduces dire poverty and economic exploitation. It makes for growth in respect for cultural identities and openness to the transcendent.<sup>230</sup>
<p><a name="2442"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2442</font></u></a></b> It is not the role of the Pastors of the Church to intervene directly in the political structuring and organization of social life. This task is part of the vocation of the <i>lay faithful</i>, acting on their own initiative with their fellow citizens. Social action can assume various concrete forms. It should always have the common good in view and be in conformity with the message of the Gospel and the teaching of the Church. It is the role of the laity "to animate temporal realities with Christian commitment, by which they show that they are witnesses and agents of peace and justice."<sup>231</sup>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> <b><a name="VI"><font color="#000000">VI. LOVE FOR THE POOR</font></a></b>

<dl>

<p><a name="2464"></a><b>2464</b> The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in our relations with others. This moral prescription flows from the vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God who is the truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth express by word or deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they undermine the foundations of the covenant. 
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. LIVING IN THE TRUTH</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2465"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2465</font></u></a></b> The Old Testament attests that <i>God is the source of all truth</i>. His Word is truth. His Law is truth. His "faithfulness endures to all generations."<sup>255</sup> Since God is "true," the members of his people are called to live in the truth.<sup>256</sup>
<p><a name="2466"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2466</font></u></a></b> In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made manifest. "Full of grace and truth," he came as the "light of the world," <i>he is the Truth</i>.<sup>257</sup> "Whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness."<sup>258</sup> The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know "the truth [that] will make you free" and that sanctifies.<sup>259</sup> To follow Jesus is to live in "the Spirit of truth," whom the Father sends in his name and who leads "into all the truth."<sup>260</sup> To his disciples Jesus teaches the unconditional love of truth: "Let what you say be simply 'Yes or No.'"<sup>261</sup>
<p><a name="2467"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2467</font></u></a></b> Man tends by nature toward the truth. He is obliged to honor and bear witness to it: "It is in accordance with their dignity that all men, because they are persons . . . are both impelled by their nature and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they come to know it and direct their whole lives in accordance with the demands of truth."<sup>262</sup>
<p><a name="2468"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2468</font></u></a></b> Truth as uprightness in human action and speech is called <i>truthfulness</i>, sincerity, or candor. Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. 
<p><a name="2469"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2469</font></u></a></b> "Men could not live with one another if there were not mutual confidence that they were being truthful to one another."<sup>263</sup> The virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps to the just mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails honesty and discretion. In justice, "as a matter of honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth."<sup>264</sup>
<p><a name="2470"></a><b>2470</b> The disciple of Christ consents to "live in the truth," that is, in the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding in his truth. "If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth."<sup>265</sup>
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2471"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2471</font></u></a></b> Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he "has come into the world, to bear witness to the truth."<sup>266</sup> The Christian is not to "be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord."<sup>267</sup> In situations that require witness to the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation, after the example of St. Paul before his judges. We must keep "a clear conscience toward God and toward men."<sup>268</sup>
<p><a name="2472"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2472</font></u></a></b> The duty of Christians to take part in the life of the Church impels them to act as <i>witnesses of the Gospel</i> and of the obligations that flow from it. This witness is a transmission of the faith in words and deeds. Witness is an act of justice that establishes the truth or makes it known.<sup>269</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>All Christians by the example of their lives and the witness of their word, wherever they live, have an obligation to manifest the new man which they have put on in Baptism and to reveal the power of the Holy Spirit by whom they were strengthened at Confirmation. <sup>270</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2473"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2473</font></u></a></b> <i>Martyrdom </i>is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith: it means bearing witness even unto death. The martyr bears witness to Christ who died and rose, to whom he is united by charity. He bears witness to the truth of the faith and of Christian doctrine. He endures death through an act of fortitude. "Let me become the food of the beasts, through whom it will be given me to reach God."<sup>271</sup>
<p><a name="2474"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2474</font></u></a></b> The Church has painstakingly collected the records of those who persevered to the end in witnessing to their faith. These are the acts of the Martyrs. They form the archives of truth written in letters of blood: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Neither the pleasures of the world nor the kingdoms of this age will be of any use to me. It is better for me to die [in order to unite myself] to Christ Jesus than to reign over the ends of the earth. I seek him who died for us; I desire him who rose for us. My birth is approaching. . .<sup>272</sup>
<p>I bless you for having judged me worthy from this day and this hour to be counted among your martyrs. . . . You have kept your promise, God of faithfulness and truth. For this reason and for everything, I praise you, I bless you, I glorify you through the eternal and heavenly High Priest, Jesus Christ, your beloved Son. Through him, who is with you and the Holy Spirit, may glory be given to you, now and in the ages to come. Amen.<sup>273</sup> </p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><b><a name="III"><font color="#000000">III. OFFENSES AGAINST TRUTH</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2475"></a><b>2475</b> Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."<sup>274</sup> By "putting away falsehood," they are to "put away all malice and all guile and insincerity and envy and all slander."<sup>275</sup>
<p><a name="2476"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2476</font></u></a></b> <i>False witness and perjury</i>. When it is made publicly, a statement contrary to the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it becomes false witness.<sup>276</sup> When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts such as these contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, or the increased punishment of the accused.<sup>277</sup> They gravely compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of judicial decisions. 
<p><a name="2477"></a><b>2477</b> <i>Respect for the reputation</i> of persons forbids every attitude and word likely to cause them unjust injury.<sup>278</sup> He becomes guilty: 
<p>- of <i>rash judgment</i> who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor; 
<p>- of <i>detraction </i>who, without objectively valid reason, discloses another's faults and failings to persons who did not know them;<sup>279</sup>
<p>- of <i>calumny </i>who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them. 
<p><a name="2478"></a><b>2478</b> To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to interpret insofar as possible his neighbor's thoughts, words, and deeds in a favorable way: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Every good Christian ought to be more ready to give a favorable interpretation to another's statement than to condemn it. But if he cannot do so, let him ask how the other understands it. And if the latter understands it badly, let the former correct him with love. If that does not suffice, let the Christian try all suitable ways to bring the other to a correct interpretation so that he may be saved.<sup>280</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2479"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2479</font></u></a></b> Detraction and calumny destroy the <i>reputation and honor of one's neighbor</i>. Honor is the social witness given to human dignity, and everyone enjoys a natural right to the honor of his name and reputation and to respect. Thus, detraction and calumny offend against the virtues of justice and charity. 
<p><a name="2480"></a><b>2480</b> Every word or attitude is forbidden which by <i>flattery, adulation, or complaisance</i> encourages and confirms another in malicious acts and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of service nor friendship justifies duplicitous speech. Adulation is a venial sin when it only seeks to be agreeable, to avoid evil, to meet a need, or to obtain legitimate advantages. 
<p><a name="2481"></a><b>2481</b> <i>Boasting </i>or bragging is an offense against truth. So is <i>irony </i>aimed at disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing some aspect of his behavior. 
<p><a name="2482"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2482</font></u></a></b> "A <i>lie </i>consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of deceiving."<sup>281</sup> The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil: "You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies."<sup>282</sup>
<p><a name="2483"></a><b>2483</b> Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord. 
<p><a name="2484"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2484</font></u></a></b> The <i>gravity of a lie</i> is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by its victims. If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial sin, it becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity. 
<p><a name="2485"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2485</font></u></a></b> By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. The deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. The culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences for those who are led astray. 
<p><a name="2486"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2486</font></u></a></b> Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears apart the fabric of social relationships. 
<p><a name="2487"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2487</font></u></a></b> Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the <i>duty of reparation</i>, even if its author has been forgiven. When it is impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be made secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be directly compensated, he must be given moral satisfaction in the name of charity. This duty of reparation also concerns offenses against another's reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes material, must be evaluated in terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It obliges in conscience. 
<p><b><a name="IV"><font color="#000000">IV. RESPECT FOR THE TRUTH</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2488"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2488</font></u></a></b> The <i>right to the communication</i> of the truth is not unconditional. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether or not it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. 
<p><a name="2489"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2489</font></u></a></b> Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every <i>request for information or communication</i>. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have the right to know it.<sup>283</sup>

<p><a name="2500"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2500</font></u></a></b> The practice of goodness is accompanied by spontaneous spiritual joy and moral beauty. Likewise, truth carries with it the joy and splendor of spiritual beauty. Truth is beautiful in itself. Truth in words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created and uncreated reality, is necessary to man, who is endowed with intellect. But truth can also find other complementary forms of human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony of the cosmos-which both the child and the scientist discover-"from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator," "for the author of beauty created them."<sup>290</sup>

<dd><span>[Wisdom] is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness.<sup>291</sup> For [wisdom] is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior, for it is succeeded by the night, but against wisdom evil does not prevail.<sup>292</sup> I became enamored of her beauty.<sup>293</sup> </span></dd></dl>

Indeed, art is a distinctively human form of expression; beyond the search for the necessities of life which is common to all living creatures, art is a freely given superabundance of the human being's inner riches. Arising from talent given by the Creator and from man's own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom, uniting knowledge and skill,<sup>295</sup> to give form to the truth of reality in a language accessible to sight or hearing. To the extent that it is inspired by truth and love of beings, art bears a certain likeness to God's activity in what he has created. Like any other human activity, art is not an absolute end in itself, but is ordered to and ennobled by the ultimate end of man.<sup>296</sup>
<p><a name="2502"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2502</font></u></a></b> <i>Sacred art</i> is true and beautiful when its form corresponds to its particular vocation: evoking and glorifying, in faith and adoration, the transcendent mystery of God - the surpassing invisible beauty of truth and love visible in Christ, who "reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature," in whom "the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."<sup>297</sup> This spiritual beauty of God is reflected in the most holy Virgin Mother of God, the angels, and saints. Genuine sacred art draws man to adoration, to prayer, and to the love of God, Creator and Savior, the Holy One and Sanctifier. 
<p><a name="2503"></a><b>2503</b> For this reason bishops, personally or through delegates, should see to the promotion of sacred art, old and new, in all its forms and, with the same religious care, remove from the liturgy and from places of worship everything which is not in conformity with the truth of faith and the authentic beauty of sacred art.<sup>298</sup>

<p><span>CHAPTER TWO<br />"YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF"</span>
<p><b>ARTICLE 9<br />THE NINTH COMMANDMENT</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dd>You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor's.<sup>299</sup>
<p>Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<sup>300</sup> </p></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2514"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2514</font></u></a></b> St. John distinguishes three kinds of covetousness or concupiscence: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.<sup>301</sup> In the Catholic catechetical tradition, the ninth commandment forbids carnal concupiscence; the tenth forbids coveting another's goods. 
<p><a name="2515"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2515</font></u></a></b> Etymologically, "concupiscence" can refer to any intense form of human desire. Christian theology has given it a particular meaning: the movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the operation of the human reason. The apostle St. Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the "flesh" against the "spirit."<sup>302</sup> Concupiscence stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's moral faculties and, without being in itself an offense, inclines man to commit sins.<sup>303</sup>
<p><a name="2516"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2516</font></u></a></b> Because man is a <i>composite being, spirit and body</i>, there already exists a certain tension in him; a certain struggle of tendencies between "spirit" and "flesh" develops. But in fact this struggle belongs to the heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin and at the same time a confirmation of it. It is part of the daily experience of the spiritual battle: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>For the Apostle it is not a matter of despising and condemning the body which with the spiritual soul constitutes man's nature and personal subjectivity. Rather, he is concerned with the morally <i>good or bad</i> works, or better, the permanent dispositions - virtues and vices - which are the fruit of <i>submission </i>(in the first case) or of <i>resistance </i>(in the second case) to <i>the saving action of the Holy Spirit</i>. For this reason the Apostle writes: "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."<sup>304</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. PURIFICATION OF THE HEART</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2517"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2517</font></u></a></b> The heart is the seat of moral personality: "Out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication. . . . "<sup>305</sup> The struggle against carnal covetousness entails purifying the heart and practicing temperance: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Remain simple and innocent, and you will be like little children who do not know the evil that destroys man's life.<sup>306</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2518"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2518</font></u></a></b> The sixth beatitude proclaims, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."<sup>307</sup> "Pure in heart" refers to those who have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity;<sup>308</sup> chastity or sexual rectitude;<sup>309</sup> love of truth and orthodoxy of faith.<sup>310</sup> There is a connection between purity of heart, of body, and of faith: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed "so that by believing they may obey God, by obeying may live well, by living well may purify their hearts, and with pure hearts may understand what they believe."<sup>311</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2519"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2519</font></u></a></b> The "pure in heart" are promised that they will see God face to face and be like him.<sup>312</sup> Purity of heart is the precondition of the vision of God. Even now it enables us to see <i>according </i>to God, to accept others as "neighbors"; it lets us perceive the human body - ours and our neighbor's - as a temple of the Holy Spirit, a manifestation of divine beauty. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE BATTLE FOR PURITY</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2520"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2520</font></u></a></b> Baptism confers on its recipient the grace of purification from all sins. But the baptized must continue to struggle against concupiscence of the flesh and disordered desires. With God's grace he will prevail 
<p>- by the <i>virtue </i>and <i>gift of chastity</i>, for chastity lets us love with upright and undivided heart; 
<p>- by <i>purity of intention</i> which consists in seeking the true end of man: with simplicity of vision, the baptized person seeks to find and to fulfill God's will in everything;<sup>313</sup>
<p>- by <i>purity of vision</i>, external and internal; by discipline of feelings and imagination; by refusing all complicity in impure thoughts that incline us to turn aside from the path of God's commandments: "Appearance arouses yearning in fools";<sup>314</sup>
<p>- by <i>prayer</i>: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>I thought that continence arose from one's own powers, which I did not recognize in myself. I was foolish enough not to know . . . that no one can be continent unless you grant it. For you would surely have granted it if my inner groaning had reached your ears and I with firm faith had cast my cares on you.<sup>315</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2521"></a><b>2521</b> Purity requires <i>modesty</i>, an integral part of temperance. Modesty protects the intimate center of the person. It means refusing to unveil what should remain hidden. It is ordered to chastity to whose sensitivity it bears witness. It guides how one looks at others and behaves toward them in conformity with the dignity of persons and their solidarity. 
<p><a name="2522"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2522</font></u></a></b> Modesty protects the mystery of persons and their love. It encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships; it requires that the conditions for the definitive giving and commitment of man and woman to one another be fulfilled. Modesty is decency. It inspires one's choice of clothing. It keeps silence or reserve where there is evident risk of unhealthy curiosity. It is discreet. 
<p><a name="2523"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2523</font></u></a></b> <span>There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It protests, for example, against the voyeuristic explorations of the human body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of certain media that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty inspires a way of life which makes it possible to resist the allurements of fashion and the pressures of prevailing ideologies. </span>
<p><a name="2524"></a><b>2524</b> <span>The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another. Everywhere, however, modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening consciousness of being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means awakening in them respect for the human person. </span>
<p><a name="2525"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2525</font></u></a></b> Christian purity requires a <i>purification of the social climate</i>. It requires of the communications media that their presentations show concern for respect and restraint. Purity of heart brings freedom from widespread eroticism and avoids entertainment inclined to voyeurism and illusion. 
<p><a name="2526"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2526</font></u></a></b> So called <i>moral permissiveness</i> rests on an erroneous conception of human freedom; the necessary precondition for the development of true freedom is to let oneself be educated in the moral law. Those in charge of education can reasonably be expected to give young people instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the moral and spiritual dignity of man. 
<p><a name="2527"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2527</font></u></a></b> "The Good News of Christ continually renews the life and culture of fallen man; it combats and removes the error and evil which flow from the ever-present attraction of sin. It never ceases to purify and elevate the morality of peoples. It takes the spiritual qualities and endowments of every age and nation, and with supernatural riches it causes them to blossom, as it were, from within; it fortifies, completes, and restores them in Christ."<sup>316</sup>

<p><a name="2534"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2534</font></u></a></b> The tenth commandment unfolds and completes the ninth, which is concerned with concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids coveting the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, and fraud, which the seventh commandment forbids. "Lust of the eyes" leads to the violence and injustice forbidden by the fifth commandment.<sup>319</sup> Avarice, like fornication, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three prescriptions of the Law.<sup>320</sup> The tenth commandment concerns the intentions of the heart; with the ninth, it summarizes all the precepts of the Law. 
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. THE DISORDER OF COVETOUS DESIRES</font></a></b>
<p><a name="2535"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2535</font></u></a></b> The sensitive appetite leads us to desire pleasant things we do not have, e.g., the desire to eat when we are hungry or to warm ourselves when we are cold. These desires are good in themselves; but often they exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not ours and belongs to another or is owed to him. 
<p><a name="2536"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2536</font></u></a></b> The tenth commandment forbids greed and the desire to amass earthly goods without limit. It forbids avarice arising from a passion for riches and their attendant power. It also forbids the desire to commit injustice by harming our neighbor in his temporal goods: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>When the Law says, "You shall not covet," these words mean that we should banish our desires for whatever does not belong to us. Our thirst for another's goods is immense, infinite, never quenched. Thus it is written: "He who loves money never has money enough."<sup>321</sup> </span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="2537"></a><b>2537</b> It is not a violation of this commandment to desire to obtain things that belong to one's neighbor, provided this is done by just means.

<p>The God of the promises always warned man against seduction by what from the beginning has seemed "good for food . . . a delight to the eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise."<sup>330</sup>
<p><a name="2542"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2542</font></u></a></b> The Law entrusted to Israel never sufficed to justify those subject to it; it even became the instrument of "lust."<sup>331</sup> The gap between wanting and doing points to the conflict between God's Law which is the "law of my mind," and another law "making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members."<sup>332</sup>

<p><a name="2544"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2544</font></u></a></b> Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them "renounce all that [they have]" for his sake and that of the Gospel.<sup>335</sup> Shortly before his passion he gave them the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.<sup>336</sup> The precept of detachment from riches is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. 
<p><a name="2545"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">2545</font></u></a></b> All Christ's faithful are to "direct their affections rightly, lest they be hindered in their pursuit of perfect charity by the use of worldly things and by an adherence to riches which is contrary to the spirit of evangelical poverty."<sup>337</sup>

God himself will be virtue's reward; he gives virtue and has promised to give himself as the best and greatest reward that could exist. . . . "I shall be their God and they will be my people. . . .

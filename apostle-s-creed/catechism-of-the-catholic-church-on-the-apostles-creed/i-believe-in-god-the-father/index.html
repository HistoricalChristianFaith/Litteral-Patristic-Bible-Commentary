<p><span><b>SECTION TWO<br />THE PROFESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH</b> </span>
<p><span>CHAPTER ONE<br />I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER</span>
<p><a name="198"></a><b>198</b> Our profession of faith begins with <i>God</i>, for God is the First and the Last,<sup>1</sup> the beginning and the end of everything. The Credo begins with God the <i>Father</i>, for the Father is the first divine person of the Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of heaven and earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God's works. 
<p><b>ARTICLE I<br />"I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"</b>
<p><span>Paragraph 1. I Believe in God</span>
<p><a name="199"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">199</font></u></a></b> "I believe in God": this first affirmation of the Apostles' Creed is also the most fundamental. The whole Creed speaks of God, and when it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in relation to God. The other articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining Commandments make the first explicit. The other articles help us to know God better as he revealed himself progressively to men. "The faithful first profess their belief in God."<sup>2</sup>
<p><a name="I"><b><font color="#000000">I. "I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD"</font></b></a>
<p><a name="200"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">200</font></u></a></b> These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed begins. The confession of God's oneness, which has its roots in the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the profession of God's existence and is equally fundamental. God is unique; there is only one God: "The Christian faith confesses that God is one in nature, substance and essence."<sup>3</sup>
<p><a name="201"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">201</font></u></a></b> To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."<sup>4</sup> Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all nations to turn to him, the one and only God: "Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.. . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. 'Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength.'"<sup>5</sup>
<p><a name="202"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">202</font></u></a></b> Jesus himself affirms that God is "the one Lord" whom you must love "with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength".<sup>6</sup> At the same time Jesus gives us to understand that he himself is "the Lord".<sup>7</sup> To confess that Jesus is Lord is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not contrary to belief in the One God. Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit as "Lord and giver of life" introduce any division into the One God: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there is only one true God, eternal infinite (immensus) and unchangeable, incomprehensible, almighty and ineffable, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or nature entirely simple.<sup>8</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="II"><b><font color="#000000">II. GOD REVEALS HIS NAME</font></b></a>
<p><a name="203"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">203</font></u></a></b> God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his name known to them. A name expresses a person's essence and identity and the meaning of this person's life. God has a name; he is not an anonymous force. To disclose one's name is to make oneself known to others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by becoming accessible, capable of being known more intimately and addressed personally. 
<p><a name="204"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">204</font></u></a></b> God revealed himself progressively and under different names to his people, but the revelation that proved to be the fundamental one for both the Old and the New Covenants was the revelation of the divine name to Moses in the theophany of the burning bush, on the threshold of the Exodus and of the covenant on Sinai. 
<p><a name="205"></a><b>The living God</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">205</font></u></a></b> God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that burns without being consumed: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."<sup>9</sup> God is the God of the fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs in their wanderings. He is the faithful and compassionate God who remembers them and his promises; he comes to free their descendants from slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time, can do this and wills to do it, the God who will put his almighty power to work for this plan. 
<p><b>"I Am who I Am"</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?" God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you'. . . this is my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations."<sup>10</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="206"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">206</font></u></a></b> In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH ("I AM HE WHO IS", "I AM WHO AM" or "I AM WHO I AM"), God says who he is and by what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is - infinitely above everything that we can understand or say: he is the "hidden God", his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes himself close to men.<sup>11</sup>
<p><a name="207"></a><b>207</b> By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past ("I am the God of your father"), as for the future ("I will be with you").<sup>12</sup> God, who reveals his name as "I AM", reveals himself as the God who is always there, present to his people in order to save them. 
<p><a name="208"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">208</font></u></a></b> Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence, man discovers his own insignificance. Before the burning bush, Moses takes off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of God's holiness.<sup>13</sup> Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah cries out: "Woe is me! I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips."<sup>14</sup> Before the divine signs wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."<sup>15</sup> But because God is holy, he can forgive the man who realizes that he is a sinner before him: "I will not execute my fierce anger. . . for I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst."<sup>16</sup> The apostle John says likewise: "We shall. . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything."<sup>17</sup>
<p><a name="209"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">209</font></u></a></b> <span>Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not pronounce his name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed name (YHWH) is replaced by the divine title "LORD" (in Hebrew <i>Adonai</i>, in Greek <i>Kyrios</i>). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus will be acclaimed: "Jesus is LORD."</span>
<p><a name="210"></a><b>"A God merciful and gracious"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">210</font></u></a></b> After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from God to worship the golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of intercession and agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, thus demonstrating his love.<sup>18</sup> When Moses asks to see his glory, God responds "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name 'the LORD' [YHWH]."<sup>19</sup> Then the LORD passes before Moses and proclaims, "YHWH, YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness"; Moses then confesses that the LORD is a forgiving God.<sup>20</sup>
<p><a name="211"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">211</font></u></a></b> The divine name, "I Am" or "He Is", expresses God's faithfulness: despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punishment it deserves, he keeps "steadfast love for thousands".<sup>21</sup> By going so far as to give up his own Son for us, God reveals that he is "rich in mercy".<sup>22</sup> By giving his life to free us from sin, Jesus reveals that he himself bears the divine name: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will realize that "I AM"."<sup>23</sup>
<p><a name="212"></a><b>God alone IS</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">212</font></u></a></b> Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and deepen realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the divine name. God is unique; there are no other gods besides him.<sup>24</sup> He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth: "They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a garment. . . .but you are the same, and your years have no end."<sup>25</sup> In God "there is no variation or shadow due to change."<sup>26</sup> God is "HE WHO IS", from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains ever faithful to himself and to his promises. 
<p><a name="213"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">213</font></u></a></b> The revelation of the ineffable name "I AM WHO AM" contains then the truth that God alone IS. The Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church's Tradition, understood the divine name in this sense: God is the fullness of Being and of every perfection, without origin and without end. All creatures receive all that they are and have from him; but he alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything that he is. 
<p><a name="III"><b><font color="#000000">III. GOD, "HE WHO IS", IS TRUTH AND LOVE</font></b></a>
<p><a name="214"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">214</font></u></a></b> God, "HE WHO IS", revealed himself to Israel as the one "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness".<sup>27</sup> These two terms express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works God displays, not only his kindness, goodness, grace and steadfast love, but also his trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness and truth. "I give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness."<sup>28</sup> He is the Truth, for "God is light and in him there is no darkness"; "God is love", as the apostle John teaches.<sup>29</sup>
<p><a name="215"></a><b>God is Truth</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">215</font></u></a></b> "The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever."<sup>30</sup> "And now, O LORD God, you are God, and your words are true";<sup>31</sup> this is why God's promises always come true.<sup>32</sup> God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive. This is why one can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of his word in all things. The beginning of sin and of man's fall was due to a lie of the tempter who induced doubt of God's word, kindness and faithfulness. 
<p><a name="216"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">216</font></u></a></b> God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created order and governs the world.<sup>33</sup> God, who alone made heaven and earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created thing in relation to himself.<sup>34</sup>
<p><a name="217"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">217</font></u></a></b> God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching that comes from God is "true instruction".<sup>35</sup> When he sends his Son into the world it will be "to bear witness to the truth":<sup>36</sup> "We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true."<sup>37</sup>
<p><a name="218"></a><b>God is Love</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">218</font></u></a></b> In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive for choosing them from among all peoples as his special possession: his sheer gratuitous love.<sup>38</sup> And thanks to the prophets Israel understood that it was again out of love that God never stopped saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.<sup>39</sup>
<p><a name="219"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">219</font></u></a></b> God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his son. His love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her children. God loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be victorious over even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most precious gift: "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son."<sup>40</sup>
<p><a name="220"></a><b>220</b> God's love is "everlasting":<sup>41</sup> "For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you."<sup>42</sup> Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you."<sup>43</sup>
<p><a name="221"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">221</font></u></a></b> But St. John goes even further when he affirms that "God is love":<sup>44</sup> God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost secret:<sup>45</sup> God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange.

<p><span>Paragraph 2. The Father</span>
<p><a name="232"></a><a name="I"><b><font color="#000000">I. "IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT"</font></b></a>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">232</font></u></a></b> Christians are baptized "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"<sup>53</sup> Before receiving the sacrament, they respond to a three-part question when asked to confess the Father, the Son and the Spirit: "I do." "The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity."<sup>54</sup>
<p><a name="233"></a><b>233</b> Christians are baptized in the <i>name </i>of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in their <i>names</i>,<sup>55</sup> for there is only one God, the almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy Trinity. 
<p><a name="234"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">234</font></u></a></b> The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching in the "hierarchy of the truths of faith".<sup>56</sup> The whole history of salvation is identical with the history of the way and the means by which the one true God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men "and reconciles and unites with himself those who turn away from sin".<sup>57</sup>
<p><a name="235"></a><b>235</b> This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was revealed, (II) how the Church has articulated the doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and (III) how, by the divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfills the "plan of his loving goodness" of creation, redemption and sanctification. 
<p><a name="236"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">236</font></u></a></b> <span>The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology (<i>theologia</i>) and economy (<i>oikonomia</i>). "Theology" refers to the mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the <i>oikonomia </i>the <i>theologia </i>is revealed to us; but conversely, the <i>theologia </i>illuminates the whole oikonomia. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.<br /></span>
<p><a name="237"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">237</font></u></a></b> The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the "mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God".<sup>58</sup> To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel's faith before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE REVELATION OF GOD AS TRINITY</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="238"></a><b>The Father revealed by the Son</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">238</font></u></a></b> Many religions invoke God as "Father". The deity is often considered the "father of gods and of men". In Israel, God is called "Father" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.<sup>59</sup> Even more, God is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel, "his first-born son".<sup>60</sup> God is also called the Father of the king of Israel. Most especially he is "the Father of the poor", of the orphaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection.<sup>61</sup>
<p><a name="239"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">239</font></u></a></b> <span>By calling God "Father", the language of faith indicates two main things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for all his children. God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the image of motherhood,<sup>62</sup> which emphasizes God's immanence, the intimacy between Creator and creature. The language of faith thus draws on the human experience of parents, who are in a way the first representatives of God for man. But this experience also tells us that human parents are fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God. He also transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, although he is their origin and standard:<sup>63</sup> no one is father as God is Father.<br /></span>
<p><a name="240"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">240</font></u></a></b> Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father in relation to his only Son, who is eternally Son only in relation to his Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."<sup>64</sup>
<p><a name="241"></a><b>241</b> For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"; as "the image of the invisible God"; as the "radiance of the glory of God and the very stamp of his nature".<sup>65</sup>
<p><a name="242"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">242</font></u></a></b> Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is "consubstantial" with the Father, that is, one only God with him.<sup>66</sup> The second ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed "the only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father".<sup>67</sup>
<p><b>The Father and the Son revealed by the Spirit</b>
<p><a name="243"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">243</font></u></a></b> Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of "another Paraclete" (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since creation, having previously "spoken through the prophets", the Spirit will now be with and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them "into all the truth".<sup>68</sup> The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another divine person with Jesus and the Father. 
<p><a name="244"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">244</font></u></a></b> The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in time. The Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had returned to the Father.<sup>69</sup> The sending of the person of the Spirit after Jesus' glorification<sup>70</sup> reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy Trinity. 
<p><a name="245"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">245</font></u></a></b> The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by the second ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): "We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father."<sup>71</sup> By this confession, the Church recognizes the Father as "the source and origin of the whole divinity".<sup>72</sup> But the eternal origin of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin: "The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and equal with the Father and the Son, of the same substance and also of the same nature. . . Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father alone,. . . but the Spirit of both the Father and the Son."<sup>73</sup> The Creed of the Church from the Council of Constantinople confesses: "With the Father and the Son, he is worshipped and glorified."<sup>74</sup>
<p><a name="246"></a><b>246</b> The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit "proceeds from the Father <i>and the Son (filioque)</i>". The Council of Florence in 1438 explains: "The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (<i>simul</i>) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration. . . . And, since the Father has through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son."<sup>75</sup>
<p><a name="247"></a><b>247</b> <span>The affirmation of the <i>filioque </i>does not appear in the Creed confessed in 381 at Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it dogmatically in 447,<sup>76</sup> even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon, came to recognize and receive the Symbol of 381. The use of this formula in the Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin liturgy (between the eighth and eleventh centuries). The introduction of the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox Churches.<br /></span>
<p><a name="248"></a><b>248</b> <span>At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he "who proceeds from the Father", it affirms that he <i>comes from</i> the Father <i>through </i>the Son.<sup>77</sup> The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (<i>filioque</i>). It says this, "legitimately and with good reason",<sup>78</sup> for the eternal order of the divine persons in their consubstantial communion implies that the Father, as "the principle without principle",<sup>79</sup> is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.<sup>80</sup> This legitimate complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.<br /></span>

<p><a name="249"></a><b>The formation of the Trinitarian dogma</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">249</font></u></a></b> From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally by means of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal faith, formulated in the preaching, catechesis and prayer of the Church. Such formulations are already found in the apostolic writings, such as this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."<sup>81</sup>
<p><a name="250"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">250</font></u></a></b> During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify her Trinitarian faith, both to deepen her own understanding of the faith and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the theological work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the Christian people's sense of the faith. 
<p><a name="251"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">251</font></u></a></b> <span>In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to develop her own terminology with the help of certain notions of philosophical origin: "substance", "person" or "hypostasis", "relation" and so on. In doing this, she did not submit the faith to human wisdom, but gave a new and unprecedented meaning to these terms, which from then on would be used to signify an ineffable mystery, "infinitely beyond all that we can humanly understand".<sup>82</sup></span>
<p><a name="252"></a><b>252</b> The Church uses (I) the term "substance" (rendered also at times by "essence" or "nature") to designate the divine being in its unity, (II) the term "person" or "hypostasis" to designate the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III) the term "relation" to designate the fact that their distinction lies in the relationship of each to the others. 
<p><a name="253"></a><b>The dogma of the Holy Trinity</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">253</font></u></a></b> <i>The Trinity is One</i>. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".<sup>83</sup> The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire: "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e. by nature one God."<sup>84</sup> In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature."<sup>85</sup>
<p><a name="254"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">254</font></u></a></b> <i>The divine persons are really distinct from one another</i>. "God is one but not solitary."<sup>86</sup> "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son."<sup>87</sup> They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."<sup>88</sup> The divine Unity is Triune. 
<p><a name="255"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">255</font></u></a></b> <i>The divine persons are relative to one another</i>. Because it does not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one another: "In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one nature or substance."<sup>89</sup> Indeed "everything (in them) is one where there is no opposition of relationship."<sup>90</sup> "Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son."<sup>91</sup>

<p><a name="257"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">257</font></u></a></b> "O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!"<sup>93</sup> God is eternal blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the glory of his blessed life. Such is the "plan of his loving kindness", conceived by the Father before the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: "He destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son", through "the spirit of sonship".<sup>94</sup> This plan is a "grace [which] was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began", stemming immediately from Trinitarian love.<sup>95</sup> It unfolds in the work of creation, the whole history of salvation after the fall, and the missions of the Son and the Spirit, which are continued in the mission of the Church.<sup>96</sup>
<p><a name="258"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">258</font></u></a></b> The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too does it have only one and the same operation: "The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle."<sup>97</sup> However, each divine person performs the common work according to his unique personal property. Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament, "one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are".<sup>98</sup> It is above all the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that show forth the properties of the divine persons. 
<p><a name="259"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">259</font></u></a></b> Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine economy makes known both what is proper to the divine persons, and their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life is a communion with each of the divine persons, without in any way separating them. Everyone who glorifies the Father does so through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does so because the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him.<sup>99</sup>
<p><a name="260"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">260</font></u></a></b> The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of God's creatures into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.<sup>100</sup> But even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy Trinity: "If a man loves me", says the Lord, "he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him":<sup>101</sup> <br />

<dd><span>O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble my peace or make me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest.

<p><b><a name="brief"><font color="#000000">IN BRIEF</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="261"></a><b>261</b> The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian life. God alone can make it known to us by revealing himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 
<p><a name="262"></a><b>262</b> The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, which means that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is one and the same God. 
<p><a name="263"></a><b>263</b> The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son (<i>Jn </i>14:26) and by the Son "from the Father" (<i>Jn </i>15:26), reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. "With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified" (Nicene Creed). 
<p><a name="264"></a><b>264</b> "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from the communion of both the Father and the Son" (St. Augustine, <i>De Trin</i>. 15, 26, 47: PL 42, 1095). 
<p><a name="265"></a><b>265</b> By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit", we are called to share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light (cf. Paul VI, <i>CPG</i> § 9). 
<p><a name="266"></a><b>266</b> "Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal" (Athanasian Creed: DS 75; ND 16). 
<p><a name="267"></a><b>267</b> Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do. But within the single divine operation each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, especially in the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

<p><span>Paragraph 3. The Almighty</span>
<p><a name="268"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">268</font></u></a></b> Of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is named in the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our lives. We believe that his might is <i>universal</i>, for God who created everything also rules everything and can do everything. God's power is loving, for he is our Father, and <i>mysterious</i>, for only faith can discern it when it "is made perfect in weakness".<sup>103</sup>
<p><a name="269"></a><b>"He does whatever he pleases"<sup>104</sup></b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">269</font></u></a></b> The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal power of God. He is called the "Mighty One of Jacob", the "LORD of hosts", the "strong and mighty" one. If God is almighty "in heaven and on earth", it is because he made them.<sup>105</sup> Nothing is impossible with God, who disposes his works according to his will.<sup>106</sup> He is the Lord of the universe, whose order he established and which remains wholly subject to him and at his disposal. He is master of history, governing hearts and events in keeping with his will: "It is always in your power to show great strength, and who can withstand the strength of your arm?<sup>107</sup>
<p><a name="270"></a><b>"You are merciful to all, for you can do all things"<sup>108</sup></b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">270</font></u></a></b> God is the <i>Father </i>Almighty, whose fatherhood and power shed light on one another: God reveals his fatherly omnipotence by the way he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he gives us ("I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty"):<sup>109</sup> finally by his infinite mercy, for he displays his power at its height by freely forgiving sins. 
<p><a name="271"></a><b>271</b> God's almighty power is in no way arbitrary: "In God, power, essence, will, intellect, wisdom, and justice are all identical. Nothing therefore can be in God's power which could not be in his just will or his wise intellect."<sup>110</sup>
<p><a name="272"></a><b>The mystery of God's apparent powerlessness</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">272</font></u></a></b> Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by the experience of evil and suffering. God can sometimes seem to be absent and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysterious way God the Father has revealed his almighty power in the voluntary humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he conquered evil. Christ crucified is thus "the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."<sup>111</sup> It is in Christ's Resurrection and exaltation that the Father has shown forth "the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe".<sup>112</sup>
<p><a name="273"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">273</font></u></a></b> Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's almighty power. This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to draw to itself Christ's power.<sup>113</sup> The Virgin Mary is the supreme model of this faith, for she believed that "nothing will be impossible with God", and was able to magnify the Lord: "For he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name."<sup>114</sup>
<p><a name="274"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">274</font></u></a></b> "Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God. Once our reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that [the Creed] will afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be great and marvelous things, far above the ordinary laws of nature."<sup>115</sup>
<p><b><a name="brief"><font color="#000000">IN BRIEF</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="275"></a><b>275</b> With Job, the just man, we confess: "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted" (<i>Job </i>42:2). 
<p><a name="276"></a><b>276</b> Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses her prayer to the "almighty and eternal God" ("omnipotens sempiterne Deus. .."), believing firmly that "nothing will be impossible with God" (<i>Gen </i>18:14; <i>Lk </i>1:37; <i>Mt </i>19:26). 
<p><a name="277"></a><b>277</b> God shows forth his almighty power by converting us from our sins and restoring us to his friendship by grace. "God, you show your almighty power above all in your mercy and forgiveness. . ." (<i>Roman Missal</i>, 26th Sunday, Opening Prayer). 
<p><a name="278"></a><b>278</b> If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how can we believe that the Father could create us, the Son redeem us and the Holy Spirit sanctify us?

<p><span>Paragraph 4. The Creator </span>
<p><a name="279"></a><b>279</b> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."<sup>116</sup> Holy Scripture begins with these solemn words. The profession of faith takes them up when it confesses that God the Father almighty is "Creator of heaven and earth" (<i>Apostles' Creed</i>), "of all that is, seen and unseen" (<i>Nicene Creed</i>). We shall speak first of the Creator, then of creation and finally of the fall into sin from which Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to raise us up again. 
<p><a name="280"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">280</font></u></a></b> Creation is the foundation of "all God's saving plans," the "beginning of the history of salvation"<sup>117</sup> that culminates in Christ. Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the mystery of creation and reveals the end for which "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth": from the beginning, God envisaged the glory of the new creation in Christ.<sup>118</sup>
<p><a name="281"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">281</font></u></a></b> <span>And so the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the new creation in Christ, begin with the creation account; likewise in the Byzantine liturgy, the account of creation always constitutes the first reading at the vigils of the great feasts of the Lord. According to ancient witnesses the instruction of catechumens for Baptism followed the same itinerary.<sup>119</sup></span>
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. CATECHESIS ON CREATION</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="282"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">282</font></u></a></b> Catechesis on creation is of major importance. It concerns the very foundations of human and Christian life: for it makes explicit the response of the Christian faith to the basic question that men of all times have asked themselves:<sup>120</sup> "Where do we come from?" "Where are we going?" "What is our origin?" "What is our end?" "Where does everything that exists come from and where is it going?" The two questions, the first about the origin and the second about the end, are inseparable. They are decisive for the meaning and orientation of our life and actions. 
<p><a name="283"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">283</font></u></a></b> <span>The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers. With Solomon they can say: "It is he who gave me unerring knowledge of what exists, to know the structure of the world and the activity of the elements. . . for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me."<sup>121</sup></span>
<p><a name="284"></a><b>284</b> <span>The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of discovering the meaning of such an origin: is the universe governed by chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent, intelligent and good Being called "God"? And if the world does come from God's wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where does it come from? Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it?</span>
<p><a name="285"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">285</font></u></a></b> <span>Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by responses to the question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient religions and cultures produced many myths concerning origins. Some philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God, or that the development of the world is the development of God (Pantheism). Others have said that the world is a necessary emanation arising from God and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, locked, in permanent conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism). According to some of these conceptions, the world (at least the physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected or left behind (Gnosticism). Some admit that the world was made by God, but as by a watch-maker who, once he has made a watch, abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent origin for the world, but see it as merely the interplay of matter that has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts bear witness to the permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is distinctively human.<br /></span>
<p><a name="286"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">286</font></u></a></b> Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response to the question of origins. The existence of God the Creator can be known with certainty through his works, by the light of human reason,<sup>122</sup> even if this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by error. This is why faith comes to confirm and enlighten reason in the correct understanding of this truth: "By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear."<sup>123</sup>
<p><a name="287"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">287</font></u></a></b> The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that God in his tenderness wanted to reveal to his People everything that is salutary to know on the subject. Beyond the natural knowledge that every man can have of the Creator,<sup>124</sup> God progressively revealed to Israel the mystery of creation. He who chose the patriarchs, who brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by choosing Israel created and formed it, this same God reveals himself as the One to whom belong all the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he is the One who alone "made heaven and earth".<sup>125</sup>
<p><a name="288"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">288</font></u></a></b> Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation and forging of the covenant of the one God with his People. Creation is revealed as the first step towards this covenant, the first and universal witness to God's all-powerful love.<sup>126</sup> And so, the truth of creation is also expressed with growing vigor in the message of the prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy, and in the wisdom sayings of the Chosen People.<sup>127</sup>
<p><a name="289"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">289</font></u></a></b> Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three chapters of Genesis occupy a unique place. From a literary standpoint these texts may have had diverse sources. The inspired authors have placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express in their solemn language the truths of creation - its origin and its end in God, its order and goodness, the vocation of man, and finally the drama of sin and the hope of salvation. Read in the light of Christ, within the unity of Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the Church, these texts remain the principal source for catechesis on the mysteries of the "beginning": creation, fall, and promise of salvation.

<p><a name="290"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">290</font></u></a></b> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth":<sup>128</sup> three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture: the eternal God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he alone is Creator (the verb "create" - Hebrew <i>bara</i> - always has God for its subject). The totality of what exists (expressed by the formula "the heavens and the earth") depends on the One who gives it being. 
<p><a name="291"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">291</font></u></a></b> "In the beginning was the Word. . . and the Word was God. . . all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made."<sup>129</sup> The New Testament reveals that God created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him "all things were created, in heaven and on earth.. . all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."<sup>130</sup> The Church's faith likewise confesses the creative action of the Holy Spirit, the "giver of life", "the Creator Spirit" (<i>Veni, Creator Spiritus</i>), the "source of every good".<sup>131</sup>
<p><a name="292"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">292</font></u></a></b> The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant reveals the creative action of the Son and the Spirit,<sup>132</sup> inseparably one with that of the Father. This creative co-operation is clearly affirmed in the Church's rule of faith: "There exists but one God. . . he is the Father, God, the Creator, the author, the giver of order. He made all things by <i>himself</i>, that is, by his Word and by his Wisdom", "by the Son and the Spirit" who, so to speak, are "his hands".<sup>133</sup> Creation is the common work of the Holy Trinity. 
<p><b><a name="III"><font color="#000000">III. "THE WORLD WAS CREATED FOR THE GLORY OF GOD"</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="293"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">293</font></u></a></b> Scripture and Tradition never cease to teach and celebrate this fundamental truth: "The world was made for the glory of God."<sup>134</sup> St. Bonaventure explains that God created all things "not to increase his glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it",<sup>135</sup> for God has no other reason for creating than his love and goodness: "Creatures came into existence when the key of love opened his hand."<sup>136</sup> The First Vatican Council explains: 
<p><span>
<dl>
<dd>This one, true God, of his own goodness and "almighty power", not for increasing his own beatitude, nor for attaining his perfection, but in order to manifest this perfection through the benefits which he bestows on creatures, with absolute freedom of counsel "and from the beginning of time, made out of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal. . ."<sup>137</sup></dd></dl></span>
<p><a name="294"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">294</font></u></a></b> The glory of God consists in the realization of this manifestation and communication of his goodness, for which the world was created. God made us "to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, <i>to the praise of his glorious grace</i>",<sup>138</sup> for "the glory of God is man fully alive; moreover man's life is the vision of God: if God's revelation through creation has already obtained life for all the beings that dwell on earth, how much more will the Word's manifestation of the Father obtain life for those who see God."<sup>139</sup> The ultimate purpose of creation is that God "who is the creator of all things may at last become "all in all", thus simultaneously assuring his own glory and our beatitude."<sup>140</sup>
<p><b><a name="IV"><font color="#000000">IV. THE MYSTERY OF CREATION</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="295"></a><b>God creates by wisdom and love</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">295</font></u></a></b> We believe that God created the world according to his wisdom.<sup>141</sup> It is not the product of any necessity whatever, nor of blind fate or chance. We believe that it proceeds from God's free will; he wanted to make his creatures share in his being, wisdom and goodness: "For you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."<sup>142</sup> Therefore the Psalmist exclaims: "O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all"; and "The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has made."<sup>143</sup>
<p><a name="296"></a><b>God creates "out of nothing"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">296</font></u></a></b> We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from the divine substance.<sup>144</sup> God creates freely "out of nothing":<sup>145</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>If God had drawn the world from pre-existent matter, what would be so extraordinary in that? A human artisan makes from a given material whatever he wants, while God shows his power by starting from nothing to make all he wants.<sup>146</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="297"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">297</font></u></a></b> Scripture bears witness to faith in creation "out of nothing" as a truth full of promise and hope. Thus the mother of seven sons encourages them for martyrdom: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws. . . Look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.<sup>147</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="298"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">298</font></u></a></b> Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also, through the Holy Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure heart in them,<sup>148</sup> and bodily life to the dead through the Resurrection. God "gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist."<sup>149</sup> And since God was able to make light shine in darkness by his Word, he can also give the light of faith to those who do not yet know him.<sup>150</sup>
<p><a name="299"></a><b>God creates an ordered and good world</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">299</font></u></a></b> Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered: "You have arranged all things by measure and number and weight."<sup>151</sup> The universe, created in and by the eternal Word, the "image of the invisible God", is destined for and addressed to man, himself created in the "image of God" and called to a personal relationship with God.<sup>152</sup> Our human understanding, which shares in the light of the divine intellect, can understand what God tells us by means of his creation, though not without great effort and only in a spirit of humility and respect before the Creator and his work.<sup>153</sup> Because creation comes forth from God's goodness, it shares in that goodness - "And God saw that it was good. . . very good"<sup>154</sup>- for God willed creation as a gift addressed to man, an inheritance destined for and entrusted to him. On many occasions the Church has had to defend the goodness of creation, including that of the physical world.<sup>155</sup>
<p><a name="300"></a><b>God transcends creation and is present to it.</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">300</font></u></a></b> God is infinitely greater than all his works: "You have set your glory above the heavens."<sup>156</sup> Indeed, God's "greatness is unsearchable".<sup>157</sup> But because he is the free and sovereign Creator, the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures' inmost being: "In him we live and move and have our being."<sup>158</sup> In the words of St. Augustine, God is "higher than my highest and more inward than my innermost self".<sup>159</sup>
<p><a name="301"></a><b>God upholds and sustains creation.</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">301</font></u></a></b> With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. He not only gives them being and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and brings them to their final end. Recognizing this utter dependence with respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and confidence: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>For you love all things that exist, and detest none of the things that you have made; for you would not have made anything if you had hated it. How would anything have endured, if you had not willed it? Or how would anything not called forth by you have been preserved? You spare all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the living.<sup>160</sup></span></dd></dl></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></span>
<p><b><a name="V"><font color="#000000">V. GOD CARRIES OUT HIS PLAN: DIVINE PROVIDENCE</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="302"></a><b>302</b> Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator. The universe was created "in a state of journeying" (<i>in statu viae</i>) toward an ultimate perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call "divine providence" the dispositions by which God guides his creation toward this perfection: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>By his providence God protects and governs all things which he has made, "reaching mightily from one end of the earth to the other, and ordering all things well". For "all are open and laid bare to his eyes", even those things which are yet to come into existence through the free action of creatures.<sup>161</sup></span></dd></dl></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></span>
<p><a name="303"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">303</font></u></a></b> The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude of divine providence is concrete and immediate; God cares for all, from the least things to the great events of the world and its history. The sacred books powerfully affirm God's absolute sovereignty over the course of events: "Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases."<sup>162</sup> And so it is with Christ, "who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens".<sup>163</sup> As the book of Proverbs states: "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established."<sup>164</sup>
<p><a name="304"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">304</font></u></a></b> <span>And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any secondary causes. This is not a "primitive mode of speech", but a profound way of recalling God's primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the world,<sup>165</sup> and so of educating his people to trust in him. The prayer of the Psalms is the great school of this trust.<sup>166</sup></span>
<p><a name="305"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">305</font></u></a></b> Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our heavenly Father who takes care of his children's smallest needs: "Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?". . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well."<sup>167</sup>
<p><a name="306"></a><b>Providence and secondary causes</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">306</font></u></a></b> God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out he also makes use of his creatures' co-operation. This use is not a sign of weakness, but rather a token of almighty God's greatness and goodness. For God grants his creatures not only their existence, but also the dignity of acting on their own, of being causes and principles for each other, and thus of co-operating in the accomplishment of his plan. 
<p><a name="307"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">307</font></u></a></b> To human beings God even gives the power of freely sharing in his providence by entrusting them with the responsibility of "subduing" the earth and having dominion over it.<sup>168</sup> God thus enables men to be intelligent and free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to perfect its harmony for their own good and that of their neighbors. Though often unconscious collaborators with God's will, they can also enter deliberately into the divine plan by their actions, their prayers and their sufferings.<sup>169</sup> They then fully become "God's fellow workers" and co-workers for his kingdom.<sup>170</sup>
<p><a name="308"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">308</font></u></a></b> The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the first cause who operates in and through secondary causes: "For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."<sup>171</sup> Far from diminishing the creature's dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for "without a Creator the creature vanishes."<sup>172</sup> Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God's grace.<sup>173</sup>
<p><a name="309"></a><b>Providence and the scandal of evil.</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">309</font></u></a></b> If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in advance. <i>There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil.</i>
<p><a name="310"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">310</font></u></a></b> But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil could exist in it? With infinite power God could always create something better.<sup>174</sup> But with infinite wisdom and goodness God freely willed to create a world "in a state of journeying" towards its ultimate perfection. In God's plan this process of becoming involves the appearance of certain beings and the disappearance of others, the existence of the more perfect alongside the less perfect, both constructive and destructive forces of nature. With physical good there exists also <i>physical evil</i> as long as creation has not reached perfection.<sup>175</sup>
<p><a name="311"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">311</font></u></a></b> Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey toward their ultimate destinies by their free choice and preferential love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have sinned. Thus has <i>moral evil</i>, incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered the world. God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral evil.<sup>176</sup> He permits it, however, because he respects the freedom of his creatures and, mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>For almighty God. . ., because he is supremely good, would never allow any evil whatsoever to exist in his works if he were not so all-powerful and good as to cause good to emerge from evil itself.<sup>177</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="312"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">312</font></u></a></b> In time we can discover that God in his almighty providence can bring a good from the consequences of an evil, even a moral evil, caused by his creatures: "It was not you", said Joseph to his brothers, "who sent me here, but God. . . You meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive."<sup>178</sup> From the greatest moral evil ever committed - the rejection and murder of God's only Son, caused by the sins of all men - God, by his grace that "abounded all the more",<sup>179</sup> brought the greatest of goods: the glorification of Christ and our redemption. But for all that, evil never becomes a good. 
<p><a name="313"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">313</font></u></a></b> "We know that in everything God works for good for those who love him."<sup>180</sup> The constant witness of the saints confirms this truth: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>St. Catherine of Siena said to "those who are scandalized and rebel against what happens to them": "Everything comes from love, all is ordained for the salvation of man, God does nothing without this goal in mind."<sup>181</sup>
<p>St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled his daughter: "Nothing can come but that that God wills. And I make me very sure that whatsoever that be, seem it never so bad in sight, it shall indeed be the best."<sup>182</sup>
<p>Dame Julian of Norwich: "Here I was taught by the grace of God that I should steadfastly keep me in the faith. . . and that at the same time I should take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord shewed in this time - that 'all manner [of] thing shall be well.'"<sup>183</sup><br /></p></p></span></dd></dl></p>
<p><a name="314"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">314</font></u></a></b> We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history. But the ways of his providence are often unknown to us. Only at the end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we see God "face to face",<sup>184</sup> will we fully know the ways by which - even through the dramas of evil and sin - God has guided his creation to that definitive sabbath rest<sup>185</sup> for which he created heaven and earth. 
<p><b><a name="brief"><font color="#000000">IN BRIEF</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="315"></a><b>315</b> In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the first and universal witness to his almighty love and his wisdom, the first proclamation of the "plan of his loving goodness", which finds its goal in the new creation in Christ. 
<p><a name="316"></a><b>316</b> Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father in particular, it is equally a truth of faith that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of creation. 
<p><a name="317"></a><b>317</b> God alone created the universe, freely, directly and without any help. 
<p><a name="318"></a><b>318</b> No creature has the infinite power necessary to "create" in the proper sense of the word, that is, to produce and give being to that which had in no way possessed it (to call into existence "out of nothing") (cf DS 3624). 
<p><a name="319"></a><b>319</b> God created the world to show forth and communicate his glory. That his creatures should share in his truth, goodness and beauty - this is the glory for which God created them. 
<p><a name="320"></a><b>320</b> God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his Word, the Son "upholding the universe by his word of power" (<i>Heb</i> 1:3), and by his Creator Spirit, the giver of life. 
<p><a name="321"></a><b>321</b> Divine providence consists of the dispositions by which God guides all his creatures with wisdom and love to their ultimate end. 
<p><a name="322"></a><b>322</b> Christ invites us to filial trust in the providence of our heavenly Father (cf. <i>Mt </i>6:26-34), and St. Peter the apostle repeats: "Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you" (I <i>Pt </i>5:7; cf. <i>Ps</i> 55:23). 
<p><a name="323"></a><b>323</b> Divine providence works also through the actions of creatures. To human beings God grants the ability to cooperate freely with his plans. 
<p><a name="324"></a><b>324</b> The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil is a mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus Christ who died and rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives us the certainty that God would not permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very evil, by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.

<p><span>Paragraph 5. Heaven and Earth </span>
<p><a name="325"></a><b>325</b> The Apostles' Creed professes that God is "creator of heaven and earth". The Nicene Creed makes it explicit that this profession includes "all that is, seen and unseen". 
<p><a name="326"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">326</font></u></a></b> The Scriptural expression "heaven and earth" means all that exists, creation in its entirety. It also indicates the bond, deep within creation, that both unites heaven and earth and distinguishes the one from the other: "the earth" is the world of men, while "heaven" or "the heavens" can designate both the firmament and God's own "place" - "our Father in heaven" and consequently the "heaven" too which is eschatological glory. Finally, "heaven" refers to the saints and the "place" of the spiritual creatures, the angels, who surround God.<sup>186</sup>
<p><a name="327"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">327</font></u></a></b> The profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) affirms that God "from the beginning of time made at once (<i>simul</i>) out of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal, that is, the angelic and the earthly, and then (<i>deinde</i>) the human creature, who as it were shares in both orders, being composed of spirit and body."<sup>187</sup>
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. THE ANGELS</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="328"></a><b>The existence of angels - a truth of faith</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">328</font></u></a></b> The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred Scripture usually calls "angels" is a truth of faith. The witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition. 
<p><a name="329"></a><b>Who are they?</b>
<p><b>329</b> St. Augustine says: "'Angel' is the name of their office, not of their nature. If you seek the name of their nature, it is 'spirit'; if you seek the name of their office, it is 'angel': from what they are, 'spirit', from what they do, 'angel.'"<sup>188</sup> With their whole beings the angels are <i>servants </i>and messengers of God. Because they "always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven" they are the "mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word".<sup>189</sup>
<p><a name="330"></a><b>330</b> As purely <i>spiritual </i>creatures angels have intelligence and will: they are personal and immortal creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible creatures, as the splendor of their glory bears witness.<sup>190</sup>
<p><a name="331"></a><b>Christ "with all his angels"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">331</font></u></a></b> Christ is the center of the angelic world. They are <i>his </i>angels: "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him. . "<sup>191</sup> They belong to him because they were created <i>through </i>and <i>for </i>him: "for in him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities - all things were created through him and for him."<sup>192</sup> They belong to him still more because he has made them messengers of his saving plan: "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?"<sup>193</sup>
<p><a name="332"></a><b>332</b> Angels have been present since creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from afar or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the earthly paradise; protected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed Abraham's hand; communicated the law by their ministry; led the People of God; announced births and callings; and assisted the prophets, just to cite a few examples.<sup>194</sup> Finally, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of the Precursor and that of Jesus himself.<sup>195</sup>
<p><a name="333"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">333</font></u></a></b> From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels. When God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all God's angels worship him.'"<sup>196</sup> Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise: "Glory to God in the highest!"<sup>197</sup> They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been.<sup>198</sup> Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection.<sup>199</sup> They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his judgement.<sup>200</sup>
<p><a name="334"></a><b>The angels in the life of the Church</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">334</font></u></a></b> In the meantime, the whole life of the Church benefits from the mysterious and powerful help of angels.<sup>201</sup>
<p><a name="335"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">335</font></u></a></b> In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-holy God. She invokes their assistance (in the funeral liturgy's <i>In Paradisum deducant te angeli</i>. . .["May the angels lead you into Paradise. . ."]). Moreover, in the "Cherubic Hymn" of the Byzantine Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels more particularly (St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, and the guardian angels). 
<p><a name="336"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">336</font></u></a></b> From its beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their watchful care and intercession.<sup>202</sup> "Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life."<sup>203</sup> Already here on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of angels and men united in God. 
<p><b><a name="II"><font color="#000000">II. THE VISIBLE WORLD</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="337"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">337</font></u></a></b> God himself created the visible world in all its richness, diversity and order. Scripture presents the work of the Creator symbolically as a succession of six days of divine "work", concluded by the "rest" of the seventh day.<sup>204</sup> On the subject of creation, the sacred text teaches the truths revealed by God for our salvation,<sup>205</sup> permitting us to "recognize the inner nature, the value and the ordering of the whole of creation to the praise of God."<sup>206</sup>
<p><a name="338"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">338</font></u></a></b> <i>Nothing exists that does not owe its existence to God the Creator</i>. The world began when God's word drew it out of nothingness; all existent beings, all of nature, and all human history are rooted in this primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was constituted and time begun.<sup>207</sup>
<p><a name="339"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">339</font></u></a></b> <i>Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and perfection</i>. For each one of the works of the "six days" it is said: "And God saw that it was good." "By the very nature of creation, material being is endowed with its own stability, truth and excellence, its own order and laws."<sup>208</sup> Each of the various creatures, willed in its own being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom and goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which would be in contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. 
<p><a name="340"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">340</font></u></a></b> God wills the <i>interdependence of creatures</i>. The sun and the moon, the cedar and the little flower, the eagle and the sparrow: the spectacle of their countless diversities and inequalities tells us that no creature is self-sufficient. Creatures exist only in dependence on each other, to complete each other, in the service of each other. 
<p><a name="341"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">341</font></u></a></b> The <i>beauty of the universe</i>: The order and harmony of the created world results from the diversity of beings and from the relationships which exist among them. Man discovers them progressively as the laws of nature. They call forth the admiration of scholars. The beauty of creation reflects the infinite beauty of the Creator and ought to inspire the respect and submission of man's intellect and will. 
<p><a name="342"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">342</font></u></a></b> The <i>hierarchy of creatures</i> is expressed by the order of the "six days", from the less perfect to the more perfect. God loves all his creatures<sup>209</sup> and takes care of each one, even the sparrow. Nevertheless, Jesus said: "You are of more value than many sparrows", or again: "Of how much more value is a man than a sheep!"<sup>210</sup>
<p><a name="343"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">343</font></u></a></b> <i>Man is the summit</i> of the Creator's work, as the inspired account expresses by clearly distinguishing the creation of man from that of the other creatures.<sup>211</sup>
<p><a name="344"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">344</font></u></a></b> There is a <i>solidarity among all creatures</i> arising from the fact that all have the same Creator and are all ordered to his glory: May you be praised, O Lord, in all your creatures, especially brother sun, by whom you give us light for the day; he is beautiful, radiating great splendor, and offering us a symbol of you, the Most High. . . 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>May you be praised, my Lord, for sister water, who is very useful and humble, precious and chaste. . . <br />May you be praised, my Lord, for sister earth, our mother, who bears and feeds us, and produces the variety of fruits and dappled flowers and grasses. . . <br />Praise and bless my Lord, give thanks and serve him in all humility.<sup>212</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="345"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">345</font></u></a></b> <i>The sabbath - the end of the work of the six days</i>. The sacred text says that "on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done", that the "heavens and the earth were finished", and that God "rested" on this day and sanctified and blessed it.<sup>213</sup> These inspired words are rich in profitable instruction: 
<p><a name="346"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">346</font></u></a></b> <span>In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that remain firm, on which the believer can rely with confidence, for they are the sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God's covenant.<sup>214</sup> For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation, and respect the laws which the Creator has written into it.<br /></span>
<p><a name="347"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">347</font></u></a></b> <span>Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore for the worship and adoration of God. Worship is inscribed in the order of creation.<sup>215</sup> As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take precedence over "the work of God", that is, solemn worship.<sup>216</sup> This indicates the right order of human concerns.<br /></span>
<p><a name="348"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">348</font></u></a></b> <span>The sabbath is at the heart of Israel's law. To keep the commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as expressed in his work of creation.<br /></span>
<p><a name="349"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">349</font></u></a></b> The <i>eighth day</i>. But for us a new day has dawned: the day of Christ's Resurrection. The seventh day completes the first creation. The eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of creation culminates in the greater work of redemption. The first creation finds its meaning and its summit in the new creation in Christ, the splendor of which surpasses that of the first creation.<sup>217</sup>
<p><b><a name="brief"><font color="#000000">IN BRIEF</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="350"></a><b>350</b> Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God without ceasing and who serve his saving plans for other creatures: "The angels work together for the benefit of us all" (St. Thomas Aquinas, <i>STh</i> I, 114, 3, <i>ad </i>3). 
<p><a name="351"></a><b>351</b> The angels surround Christ their Lord. They serve him especially in the accomplishment of his saving mission to men. 
<p><a name="352"></a><b>352</b> The Church venerates the angels who help her on her earthly pilgrimage and protect every human being. 
<p><a name="353"></a><b>353</b> God willed the diversity of his creatures and their own particular goodness, their interdependence and their order. He destined all material creatures for the good of the human race. Man, and through him all creation, is destined for the glory of God. 
<p><a name="354"></a><b>354</b> Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations which derive from the nature of things is a principle of wisdom and a foundation for morality.

<p><span>Paragraph 6. Man </span>
<p><a name="355"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">355</font></u></a></b> "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them."<sup>218</sup> Man occupies a unique place in creation: (I) he is "in the image of God"; (II) in his own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III) he is created "male and female"; (IV) God established him in his friendship. 
<p><b><a name="I"><font color="#000000">I. "IN THE IMAGE OF GOD"</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="356"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">356</font></u></a></b> Of all visible creatures only man is "able to know and love his creator".<sup>219</sup> He is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for its own sake",<sup>220</sup> and he alone is called to share, by knowledge and love, in God's own life. It was for this end that he was created, and this is the fundamental reason for his dignity: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>What made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the incalculable love by which you have looked on your creature in yourself! You are taken with love for her; for by love indeed you created her, by love you have given her a being capable of tasting your eternal Good.<sup>221</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="357"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">357</font></u></a></b> Being in the image of God the human individual possesses the dignity of a person, who is not just something, but someone. He is capable of self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely giving himself and entering into communion with other persons. And he is called by grace to a covenant with his Creator, to offer him a response of faith and love that no other creature can give in his stead. 
<p><a name="358"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">358</font></u></a></b> God created everything for man,<sup>222</sup> but man in turn was created to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him: 
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honor? It is man that great and wonderful living creature, more precious in the eyes of God than all other creatures! For him the heavens and the earth, the sea and all the rest of creation exist. God attached so much importance to his salvation that he did not spare his own Son for the sake of man. Nor does he ever cease to work, trying every possible means, until he has raised man up to himself and made him sit at his right hand.<sup>223</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="359"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">359</font></u></a></b> "In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man truly becomes clear."<sup>224</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>St. Paul tells us that the human race takes its origin from two men: Adam and Christ. . . The first man, Adam, he says, became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. The first Adam was made by the last Adam, from whom he also received his soul, to give him life. . . The second Adam stamped his image on the first Adam when he created him. That is why he took on himself the role and the name of the first Adam, in order that he might not lose what he had made in his own image. The first Adam, the last Adam: the first had a beginning, the last knows no end. The last Adam is indeed the first; as he himself says: "I am the first and the last."<sup>225</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="360"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">360</font></u></a></b> Because of its common origin <i>the human race forms a unity</i>, for "from one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth":<sup>226</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>O wondrous vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in God. . . in the unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end: God himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for attaining this end;. . . in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for all.<sup>227</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>

<p><a name="362"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">362</font></u></a></b> The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and spiritual. The biblical account expresses this reality in symbolic language when it affirms that "then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."<sup>229</sup> Man, whole and entire, is therefore <i>willed </i>by God. 
<p><a name="363"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">363</font></u></a></b> In Sacred Scripture the term "soul" often refers to human <i>life </i>or the entire human <i>person</i>.<sup>230</sup> But "soul" also refers to the innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him,<sup>231</sup> that by which he is most especially in God's image: "soul" signifies the <i>spiritual principle</i> in man. 
<p><a name="364"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">364</font></u></a></b> The human body shares in the dignity of "the image of God": it is a human body precisely because it is animated by a spiritual soul, and it is the whole human person that is intended to become, in the body of Christ, a temple of the Spirit:<sup>232</sup>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><span>Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity. Through his very bodily condition he sums up in himself the elements of the material world. Through him they are thus brought to their highest perfection and can raise their voice in praise freely given to the Creator. For this reason man may not despise his bodily life. Rather he is obliged to regard his body as good and to hold it in honor since God has created it and will raise it up on the last day. <sup>233</sup><br /></span></dd></dl>
<p><a name="365"></a><b>365</b> The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to consider the soul to be the "form" of the body:<sup>234</sup> i.e., it is because of its spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living, human body; spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united, but rather their union forms a single nature. 
<p><a name="366"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">366</font></u></a></b> The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God - it is not "produced" by the parents - and also that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final Resurrection.<sup>235</sup>
<p><a name="367"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">367</font></u></a></b> Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul for instance prays that God may sanctify his people "wholly", with "spirit and soul and body" kept sound and blameless at the Lord's coming.<sup>236</sup> The Church teaches that this distinction does not introduce a duality into the soul.<sup>237</sup> "Spirit" signifies that from creation man is ordered to a supernatural end and that his soul can gratuitously be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with God.<sup>238</sup>
<p><a name="368"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">368</font></u></a></b> The spiritual tradition of the Church also emphasizes the <i>heart</i>, in the biblical sense of the depths of one's being, where the person decides for or against God.<sup>239</sup>
<p><b><a name="III"><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">*</font></u></a> III. "MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM"<a></a></a></b><font color="#000000"> </font>
<p><a name="369"></a><b>Equality and difference willed by God</b>
<p><b>369</b> <span>Man and woman have been <i>created</i>, which is to say, <i>willed </i>by God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on the other, in their respective beings as man and woman. "Being man" or "being woman" is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.<sup>240</sup> Man and woman are both with one and the same dignity "in the image of God". In their "being-man" and "being-woman", they reflect the Creator's wisdom and goodness.<br /></span>
<p><a name="370"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">370</font></u></a></b> In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband.<sup>241</sup>
<p><a name="371"></a><b>"Each for the other" - "A unity in two"</b>
<p><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">371</font></u></a></b> God created man and woman together and willed each for the other. The Word of God gives us to understand this through various features of the sacred text. "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper fit for him."<sup>242</sup> None of the animals can be man's partner.<sup>243</sup> The woman God "fashions" from the man's rib and brings to him elicits on the man's part a cry of wonder, an exclamation of love and communion: "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."<sup>244</sup> Man discovers woman as another "I", sharing the same humanity. 
<p><a name="372"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">372</font></u></a></b> Man and woman were made "for each other" - not that God left them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion of persons, in which each can be "helpmate" to the other, for they are equal as persons ("bone of my bones. . .") and complementary as masculine and feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming "one flesh",<sup>245</sup> they can transmit human life: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."<sup>246</sup> By transmitting human life to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents cooperate in a unique way in the Creator's work.<sup>247</sup>
<p><a name="373"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">373</font></u></a></b> In God's plan man and woman have the vocation of "subduing" the earth<sup>248</sup> as stewards of God. This sovereignty is not to be an arbitrary and destructive domination. God calls man and woman, made in the image of the Creator "who loves everything that exists",<sup>249</sup> to share in his providence toward other creatures; hence their responsibility for the world God has entrusted to them. 
<p><b><a name="IV"><font color="#000000">IV. MAN IN PARADISE</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="374"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">374</font></u></a></b> The first man was not only created good, but was also established in friendship with his Creator and in harmony with himself and with the creation around him, in a state that would be surpassed only by the glory of the new creation in Christ. 
<p><a name="375"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">375</font></u></a></b> The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical language in an authentic way, in the light of the New Testament and Tradition, teaches that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were constituted in an original "state of holiness and justice".<sup>250</sup> This grace of original holiness was "to share in. . .divine life".<sup>251</sup>
<p><a name="376"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">376</font></u></a></b> By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life were confirmed. As long as he remained in the divine intimacy, man would not have to suffer or die.<sup>252</sup> The inner harmony of the human person, the harmony between man and woman,<sup>253</sup> and finally the harmony between the first couple and all creation, comprised the state called "original justice". 
<p><a name="377"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">377</font></u></a></b> The "mastery" over the world that God offered man from the beginning was realized above all within man himself: <i>mastery of self</i>. The first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole being because he was free from the triple concupiscence<sup>254</sup> that subjugates him to the pleasures of the senses, covetousness for earthly goods, and self-assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason. 
<p><a name="378"></a><b><a href="javascript:void(0);"><u><font color="#0000ff">378</font></u></a></b> The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places him in the garden.<sup>255</sup> There he lives "to till it and keep it". Work is not yet a burden,<sup>256</sup> but rather the collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation. 
<p><a name="379"></a><b>379</b> This entire harmony of original justice, foreseen for man in God's plan, will be lost by the sin of our first parents. 
<p><b><a name="brief"><font color="#000000">IN BRIEF</font></a> </b>
<p><a name="380"></a><b>380</b> "Father,. . . you formed man in your own likeness and set him over the whole world to serve you, his creator, and to rule over all creatures" (<i>Roman Missal</i>, EP IV, 118). 
<p><a name="381"></a><b>381</b> Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God's Son made man, the "image of the invisible God" (<i>Col </i>1:15), so that Christ shall be the first-born of a multitude of brothers and sisters (cf. <i>Eph </i>1:3-6; <i>Rom </i>8:29). 
<p><a name="382"></a><b>382</b> "Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity" (<i>GS</i> 14 § 1). The doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is created immediately by God. 
<p><a name="383"></a><b>383</b> "God did not create man a solitary being. From the beginning, "male and female he created them" (<i>Gen </i>1:27). This partnership of man and woman constitutes the first form of communion between persons" (<i>GS</i> 12 § 4). 
<p><a name="384"></a><b>384</b> Revelation makes known to us the state of original holiness and justice of man and woman before sin: from their friendship with God flowed the happiness of their existence in paradise.

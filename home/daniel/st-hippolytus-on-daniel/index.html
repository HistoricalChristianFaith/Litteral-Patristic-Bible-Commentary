<h3><a name="TOC-First-fragment-Preface-"></a>First fragment (Preface)</h3>
<p>As I wish to give an accurate account of the times of the captivity of the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, and to discuss the prophecies contained in the visions of the blessed Daniel, (as well as) his manner of life from his boyhood in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, I too shall proceed to bear my testimony to that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and righteous man, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, who not only declared the visions of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> the king in those times, but also trained youths of like mind with himself, and raised up faithful witnesses in the world. He is horn, then, in the time of the prophetic ministry of the blessed Jeremiah, and in the reign of Jehoiakim or Eliakim. Along with the other captives, he is carried off a prisoner to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>. Now there are born to the blessed Josiah these five sons— Jehoahaz, Eliakim, Johanan, Zedekiah, or Jeconiah, and Sadum. And on his father's death, Jehoahaz is anointed as king by the people at the age of twenty-three years. Against him comes up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>-Necho, in the third month of his reign; and he takes him (Jehoahaz) prisoner, and carries him into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and imposes tribute on the land to the extent of one hundred talents of silver and ten talents of gold. And in his stead he sets up his brother Eliakim as king over the land, whose name also he changed to Jehoiakim, and who was then eleven years old. Against him came up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, and carries him off prisoner to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, taking with him also some of the vessels of the house in Jerusalem. Thrown into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> as a friend of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>, and as one set up by him over the kingdom, he is released at length in the thirty-seventh year by Evil-Merodach king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>; and he cut his hair short, and was counsellor to him, and ate at his table until the day that he died. On his removal, his son Jehoiakim reigns three years. And against him came up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a>, and transports him and ten thousand of the men of his people to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, and sets up in his stead his father's brother, whose name he changed also to Zedekiah; and after making agreement with him by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> and treaty, he returns to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>. This (Zedekiah), after a reign of eleven years, revolted from him and went over to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a> king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. And in the tenth year <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> came against him from (he land of the Chaldeans, and surrounded the city with a stockade, and environed it all round, and completely shut it up. In this way the larger number of them perished by famine, and others perished by the sword, and some were taken prisoners, and the city was burned with fire, and the temple and the wall were destroyed. And the army of the Chaldeans seized all the treasure that was found in the house of the Lord, and all the vessels of gold and silver; and all the brass, Nebuzaradan, chief of the slaughterers, stripped off, and carried it to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>. And the army of the Chaldeans pursued Zedekiah himself as he fled by night along with seven hundred men, and surprised him in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08339a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jericho</font></u></a>, and brought him to the king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a> at Reblatha. And the king pronounced judgment upon him in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, because he had violated the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> of the Lord, and the agreement he had made with him; and he slew his sons before his face, and put out Zedekiah's eyes. And he cast him into chains of iron, and carried him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>; and there he remained grinding at the mill until the day of his death. And when he died, they took his body and cast it behind the wall of Nineveh. In his case is fulfilled the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> of Jeremiah, saying, <q>(As) I live, says the Lord, though Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah should become the signet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck you thence; and I will give you into the hands of them that seek your life, of them whose face you fear, even into the hands of the Chaldeans. And I will cast you out, and your mother that bare you, into a country where you were not born; and there you shall die. But to the land which they desire in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, I will not send you back. Dishonoured is Jeconias, like an unserviceable vessel, of which there is no use, since he is cast out and expelled into a land which he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not. O earth, hear the word of the Lord. Write this man, a man excommunicate; for no man of his seed shall prosper (grow up), sitting upon the throne of David, ruling any more in Judah.</q> Thus the captivity in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a> befell them after the exodus from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. When the whole people, then, was transported, and the city made desolate. and the sanctuary destroyed, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled which He spoke by the mouth of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> Jeremiah, saying, <q>The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy years; </q>then we find that the blessed Daniel prophesied in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, and appeared as the vindicator of Susanna.</p></div>

<h3><a name="TOC-Second-fragment-Of-the-visions"></a>Second fragment (Of the visions</h3>
<p>The interpretation by Hippolytus, (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02581b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bishop</font></u></a>) of Rome, of the visions of Daniel and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a>, taken in conjunction. </p>
<p>1. In speaking of a <q>lioness from the sea,</q> he meant the rising of the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, and that this was the <q>golden head of the image.</q> And in speaking of its <q>eagle wings,</q> be meant that king <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> was exalted and that his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> was lifted up against God. Then he says <q>its wings were plucked off,</q> i.e., that his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> was destroyed; for he was driven out of his kingdom. And the words, <q>A man's heart was given it, and it was made stand upon the feet of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>,</q> mean that he came to himself again, and recognised that he was but a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and gave the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Then after the lioness he sees a second beast, <q>like a bear,</q> which signified the Persians. For after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylonians</font></u></a> the Persians obtained the power. And in saying that <q>it had three ribs in its mouth,</q> he pointed to the three nations, Persians, Medes, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylonians</font></u></a>, which were expressed in the image by the silver after the gold. Then comes the third beast, <q>a leopard,</q> which means the Greeks; for after the Persians, Alexander of Macedon had the power, when Darius was overthrown, which was also indicated by the brass in the image. And in saying that the beast <q>had four wings of a fowl, and four heads,</q> he showed most clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was parted into four divisions. For in speaking of four heads, he meant the four kings that arose out of it. For Alexander, when dying, divided his kingdom into four parts. Then he says, <q>The fourth beast (was) dreadful and terrible: it had iron teeth, and claws of brass.</q> Who, then, are meant by this but the Romans, whose kingdom, the kingdom that still stands, is expressed by the iron? <q>for,</q> says he, <q>its legs are of iron.</q></p>
<p>2. After this, then, what remains, beloved, but the toes of the feet of the image, in which <q>part shall be of iron and part of clay mixed together? </q>By the toes of the feet he meant, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10663b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystically</font></u></a>, the ten kings that rise out of that kingdom. As Daniel says, <q>I considered the beast; and, lo, (there were) ten horns behind, among which shall come up another little horn springing from them; </q>by which none other is meant than the antichrist that is to rise; and he shall set up the kingdom of Judah. And in saying that <q>three horns</q> were <q>plucked up by the roots</q> by this one, he indicates the three kings of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, Libya, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05566a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ethiopia</font></u></a>, whom this one will slay in the array of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>. And when he has conquered all, he will prove himself a terrible and savage tyrant, and will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> tribulation and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecution</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, exalting himself against them. And after him, it remains that <q>the stone</q> shall come from heaven which <q>smote the image</q> and shivered it, and subverted all the kingdoms, and gave the kingdom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> of the Most High. This <q>became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</q></p>
<p>3. As these things, then, are destined to come to pass, and as the toes of the image turn out to be democracies, and the ten horns of the beast are distributed among ten kings, let us look at what is before us more carefully, and scan it, as it were, with open eye. The <q>golden head of the image</q> is identical with the <q>lioness,</q> by which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylonians</font></u></a> were represented. <q>The golden shoulders and the arms of silver</q> are the same with the <q>bear,</q> by which the Persians and Medes are meant. <q>The belly and thighs of brass</q> are the <q>leopard,</q> by which the Greeks who ruled from Alexander onwards are intended. The <q>legs of iron</q> are the <q>dreadful and terrible beast,</q> by which the Romans who hold the empire now are meant. The <q>toes of clay and iron</q> are the <q>ten horns</q> which are to be. The <q>one other little horn springing up in their midst</q> is the <q>antichrist.</q> The stone that <q>smites the image and breaks it in pieces,</q> and that filled the whole earth, is Christ, who comes from heaven and brings judgment on the world.</p>
<p>4. But that we may not leave our subject at this point undemonstrated, we are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> to discuss the matter of the times, of which a man should not speak hastily, because they are a light to him. For as the times are noted from the foundation of the world, and reckoned from Adam, they set clearly before us the matter with which our inquiry deals. For the first appearance of our Lord in the flesh took place in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02533a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Bethlehem</font></u></a>, under Augustus, in the year 5500; and He suffered in the thirty-third year. And 6, 000 years must needs be accomplished, in order that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> may come, the rest, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> day <q>on which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> rested from all His works.</q> For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> is the type and emblem of the future kingdom of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, when they <q>shall reign with Christ,</q> when He comes from heaven, as John says in his Apocalypse: for <q>a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.</q> Since, then, in six days God made all things, it follows that 6, 000 years must be fulfilled. And they are not yet fulfilled, as John says: <q>five are fallen; one is,</q> that is, the sixth; <q>the other is not yet come.</q> </p>
<p>5. In mentioning the <q>other,</q> moreover, he specifies the seventh, in which there is rest. But some one may be ready to say, How will you prove to me that the Saviour was born in the year 5500? Learn that easily, O man; for the things that took place of old in the wilderness, under <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, in the case of the tabernacle, were constituted types and emblems of spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, in order that, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> came in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> in these last days, you might be able to perceive that these things were fulfilled. For He says to him, <q>And you shall make the ark of imperishable wood, and shall overlay it with pure gold within and without; and you shall make the length of it two cubits and a half, and the breadth thereof one cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half the height; </q>which measures, when summed up together, make five cubits and a half, so that the 5500 years might be signified thereby.</p>
<p>6. At that time, then, the Saviour appeared and showed His own body to the world, (born) of the Virgin, who was the <q>ark overlaid with pure gold,</q> with the Word within and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> without; so that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is demonstrated, and the <q>ark</q> made manifest. From the birth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, then, we must reckon the 500 years that remain to make up the 6000, and thus the end shall be. And that the Saviour appeared in the world, bearing the imperishable ark, His own body, at a time which was the fifth and half, John declares: <q>Now it was the sixth hour,</q> he says, intimating by that, one-half of the day. But a day with the Lord is 10000 years; and the half of that, therefore, is 500 years. For it was not meet that He should appear earlier, for the burden of the law still endured, nor yet when the sixth day was fulfilled (for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> is changed), but on the fifth and half, in order that in the remaining half time the gospel might be preached to the whole world, and that when the sixth day was completed He might end the present life.</p>
<p>7. Since, then, the Persians held the mastery for 330 years, and after them the Greeks, who were yet more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, held it for 300 years, of necessity the fourth beast, as being strong and mightier than all that were before it, will reign 500 years. When the times are fulfilled, and the ten horns spring from the beast in the last (times), then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a> will appear among them. When he makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, and persecutes them, then may we expect the manifestation of the Lord from heaven.</p>
<p>8. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> having thus instructed us with all exactness as to the certainty of the things that are to be, broke off from his present subject, and passed again to the kingdom of the Persians and Greeks, recounting to us another vision which took place, and was fulfilled in its proper time; in order that, by establishing our belief in this, he might be able to present us to God as readier <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> in the things that are to be. Accordingly, what he had narrated in the first vision, he again recounts in detail for the edification of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faithful</font></u></a>. For by the <q>ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward,</q> he means Darius, the king of the Persians, who overcame all the nations; <q>for,</q> says he, <q>these beasts shall not stand before him.</q> And by the <q>he-goat that came from the west,</q> he means Alexander the Macedonian, the king of the Greeks; and in that he <q>came against that very ram, and was moved with choler, and smote him upon the face, and shivered him, and cast him upon the ground, and stamped upon him,</q> this expresses just what has happened.</p>
<p>9. For Alexander waged <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against Darius, and overcame him, and made himself master of the whole sovereignty, after routing and destroying his camp. Then, after the exaltation of the he-goat, his horn— the great one, namely— was broken; and there arose four horns under it, toward the four winds of heaven. For, when Alexander had made himself master of all the land of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>, and had reduced its people into subjection, he thereupon died, after dividing his kingdom into four principalities, as has been shown above. And from that time <q>one horn was exalted, and grew great, even to the power of heaven; and by him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>was disturbed, and righteousness cast down to the ground.</q></p>
<p>10. For Antiochus arose, surnamed Epiphanes, who was of the line of Alexander. And after he had reigned in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Syria</font></u></a>, and brought under him all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, he went up to Jerusalem, and entered the sanctuary, and seized all the treasures in the house of the Lord, and the golden candlestick, and the table, and the altar, and made a great slaughter in the land; even as it is written: <q>And the sanctuary shall be trodden under foot, unto evening and unto morning, a thousand and three hundred days.</q> For it happened that the sanctuary remained desolate during that period, three years and a half, that the thousand and three hundred days might be fulfilled; until Judas Maccabaeus arose after the death of his father Matthias, and withstood him, and destroyed the encampment of Antiochus, and delivered the city, and recovered the sanctuary, and restored it in strict accordance with the law.</p>
<p>11. Since, then, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> Gabriel also recounted these things to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, as they have been understood by us, as they have also taken place, and as they have been all clearly described in the books of the Maccabees, let us see further what he says on the other weeks. For when he read the book of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08334a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah the prophet</font></u></a>, in which it was written that the sanctuary would be desolate seventy years, he made confession with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fastings</font></u></a> and supplications, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> that the people might return sooner from their captivity to the city Jerusalem. Thus, then, he speaks in his account: <q>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was king over the realm of the Chaldeans, I Daniel understood in the books the number of the years, as the word of the Lord had come to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08334a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah the prophet</font></u></a>, for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem in seventy years,</q> etc.</p>
<p>12. After his confession and supplication, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> says to him, <q>You are a man greatly beloved: </q>for you desire to see things of which you shall be informed by me; and in their own time these things will be fulfilled; and he touched me, saying, <q>Seventy weeks are determined upon your people, and upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> city, to seal up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> and to blot out transgressions, and to seal up vision and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, and to anoint the Most Holy; and you shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> and understand, that from the going forth of words for the answer, and for the building of Jerusalem, unto Christ the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks.</q></p>
<p>13. Having mentioned therefore seventy weeks, and having divided them into two parts, in order that what was spoken by him to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> might be better understood, he proceeds thus, <q>Unto Christ the Prince shall be seven weeks,</q> which make forty-nine years. It was in the twenty-first year that Daniel saw these things in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>. Hence, the forty-nine years added to the twenty-one, make up the seventy years, of which the blessed Jeremiah spoke: <q>The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy years from the captivity that befell them under <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a>; and after these things the people will return, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> and offering will be presented, when Christ is their Prince.</q> </p>
<p>14. Now of what Christ does he speak, but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> the son of Josedech, who returned at that time along with the people, and offered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> according to the law, in the seventieth year, when the sanctuary was built? For all the kings and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> were styled Christs, because they were anointed with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> oil, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> of old prepared. These, then, bore the name of the Lord in their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, showing aforetime the type, and presenting the image until the perfect King and Priest appeared from heaven, who alone did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the Father; as also it is written in Kings: <q>And I will raise me up a faithful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, that shall do all things according to my heart.</q> </p>
<p>15. In order, then, to show the time when He is to come whom the blessed Daniel desired to see, he says, <q>And after seven weeks there are other threescore and two weeks,</q> which period embraces the space of 434 years. For after the return of the people from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a> under the leadership of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> the son of Josedech, and Ezra the scribe, and Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of David, there were 434 years unto the coming of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, in order that the Priest of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> might be manifested in the world, and that He who takes away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of the world might be evidently set forth, as John speaks concerning Him: <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that takes away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> of the world!</q> And in like manner Gabriel says: <q>To blot out transgressions, and make reconciliation for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q> But who has blotted out our transgressions? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> the apostle teaches us, saying, <q>He is our peace who made both one; </q>and then, <q>Blotting out the handwriting of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> that was against us.</q> </p>
<p>16. That transgressions, therefore, are blotted out, and that reconciliation is made for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, is shown by this. But who are they who have reconciliation made for their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, but they who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in His name, and propitiate His countenance by good works? And that after the return of the people from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a> there was a space of 434 years, until the time of the birth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, may be easily understood. For, since the first covenant was given to the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> after a period of 434 years, it follows that the second covenant also should be defined by the same space of time, in order that it might be expected by the people and easily recognised by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faithful</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>17. And for this reason Gabriel says: <q>And to anoint the Most Holy.</q> And the Most Holy is none else but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> alone, who, when He came and manifested Himself, said to them, <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of the Lord</font></u></a> is upon me, because He has anointed me; </q>and so forth. Whosoever, therefore, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> on the heavenly Priest, were cleansed by that same Priest, and their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> were blotted out. And whosoever <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> it not on Him, despising Him as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, had their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> sealed, as those which could not be taken away; whence the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>, foreseeing that not all should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him, said, <q>To finish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and to seal up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q> For as many as continued to disbelieve Him, even to the end, had their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> not finished, but sealed to be kept for judgment. But as many as will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him as One able to remit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, have their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> blotted out. Wherefore he says: <q>And to seal up vision and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>18. For when He came who is the fulfilling of the law and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> (for the law and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> were till John), it was necessary that the things spoken by them should be confirmed (sealed), in order that at the coming of the Lord all things loosed should be brought to light, and that things bound of old should now be loosed by Him, as the Lord said Himself to the rulers of the people, when they were indignant at the cure on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a>: <q>You hypocrites, does not each one of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, being a daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, whom <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> has bound these eighteen years, be loosed on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a>? </q>Whomsoever, therefore, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> bound in chains, these did the Lord on His coming loose from the bonds of death, having bound our strong adversary and delivered humanity. As also Isaiah says: <q>Then will He say to those in chains, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.</q> </p>
<p>19. And that the things spoken of old by the law and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> were all sealed, and that they were unknown to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, Isaiah declares when he says: <q>And they will deliver the book that is sealed to one that is learned, and will say to him, Read this; and he will say, I cannot read it, for it is sealed.</q> It was meet and necessary that the things spoken of old by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> should be sealed to the unbelieving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>, who thought that they understood the letter of the law, and be opened to the believing. The things, therefore, which of old were sealed, are now by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God the Lord all open to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>20. For He was Himself the perfect Seal, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> is the key: <q>He who opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens,</q> as John says. And again, the same says: <q>And I saw, on the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals; and I saw an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? </q>and so forth. <q>And I beheld in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, a Lamb standing slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne. And when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four-and-twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having harps and golden vials full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07716a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">incense</font></u></a>, which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>. And they sing a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for You were slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Your blood.</q> He took the book, therefore, and loosed it, in order that the things spoken concerning Him of old in secret, might now be proclaimed with boldness upon the house-tops. </p>
<p>21. For this reason, then, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> says to Daniel, <q>Seal the words, for the vision is until the end of the time.</q> But to Christ it was not said <q>seal,</q> but <q>loose</q> the things bound of old; in order that, by His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, we might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> upon Him whom He has sent for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, Jesus our Lord. He says, therefore, <q>They shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall; </q>which in reality took place. For the people returned and built the city, and the temple, and the wall round about. Then he says: <q>After threescore and two weeks the times will be fulfilled, and one week will make a covenant with many; and in the midst (half) of the week <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> and oblation will be removed, and in the temple will be the abomination of desolations.</q></p>
<p>22. For when the threescore and two weeks are fulfilled, and Christ has come, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> is preached in every place, the times being then accomplished, there will remain only one week, the last, in which Elias will appear, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Enoch</font></u></a>, and in the midst of it the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01046a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">abomination of desolation</font></u></a> will be manifested, viz., <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>, announcing desolation to the world. And when he comes, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> and oblation will be removed, which now are offered to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in every place by the nations. These things being thus recounted, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> again describes another vision to us. For he had no other care save to be accurately instructed in all things that are to be, and to prove himself an instructor in such.</p>
<p>23. He says then: <q>In the third year of Cyrus king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>, a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was Belshazzar; and the word was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, and great power and understanding were given him in the vision. In those days I Daniel was mourning three weeks of days. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three weeks of days were fulfilled. On the fourth day of the first month I humbled myself,</q> says he, <q>one and twenty days,</q> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a> to the living <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and asking of Him the revelation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>. And the Father in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> heard me, and sent His own Word, to show what should happen by Him. And that took place, indeed, by the great river. For it was meet that the Son should be manifested there, where also He was to remove <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>24. <q>And I lifted up my eyes,</q> he says, <q>and, behold, a man clothed in linen.</q> In the first vision he says, <q>Behold, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> Gabriel (was) sent.</q> Here, however, it is not so; but he sees the Lord, not yet indeed as perfect man, but with the appearance and form of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, as he says: <q>And, behold, a man clothed in linen.</q> For in being clothed in a various-coloured coat, he indicated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10663b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystically</font></u></a> the variety of the graces of our calling. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priestly</font></u></a> coat was made up of different colours, as various nations waited for Christ's coming, in order that we might be made up (as one body) of many colours. <q>And his loins were girded with the gold of Ophaz.</q></p>
<p>25. Now the word <q>Ophaz,</q> which is a word transferred from Hebrew to Greek, denotes pure gold. With a pure girdle, therefore, he was girded round the loins. For the Word was to bear us all, binding us like a girdle round His body, in His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. The complete body was His, but we are members in His body, united together, and sustained by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Word</font></u></a> Himself. <q>And his body was like Tharses.</q> Now <q>Tharses,</q> by interpretation, is <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05566a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ethiopians</font></u></a>.</q> For that it would be difficult to recognise Him, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> had thus already announced beforehand, intimating that He would be manifested in the flesh in the world, but that many would find it difficult to recognise Him. <q>And his face as lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire; </q>for it was meet that the fiery and judicial power of the Word should be signified aforetime, in the exercise of which He will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the fire (of His judgment) to light with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> upon the impious, and consume them.</p>
<p>26. He added also these words: <q>And his arms and his feet like polished brass; </q>to denote the first calling of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and the second calling like it, viz. of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. <q>For the last shall be as the first; for I will set your rulers as at the beginning, and your leaders as before. And His voice was as the voice of a great multitude.</q> For all we who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him in these days utter things oracular, as speaking by His mouth the things appointed by Him.</p>
<p>27. And after a little He says to him: <q>Do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> wherefore I come unto you? And now will I return to fight with the prince of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>. But I will show you that which is noted in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>: and there is none that holds with me in these things but Michael your prince, and I left him there. For from the day that you gave your countenance to be afflicted before the Lord your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> was heard, and I was sent to fight with the prince of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>: </q>for a certain counsel was formed not to send the people away: <q>that therefore your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> might be speedily granted, I withstood him, and left Michael there.</q></p>
<p>28. And who was he that spoke, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> who was given to the people, as he says in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10582c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">law of Moses</font></u></a>: <q>I will not go with you, because the people is stiff-necked; but my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> shall go before along with you? </q>This (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>) withstood <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> at the inn, when he was bringing the child uncircumcised into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. For it was not allowed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, who was the eider (or legate) and mediator of the law, and who proclaimed the covenant of the fathers, to introduce a child uncircumcised, lest he should be deemed a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophet</font></u></a> and deceiver by the people. <q>And now,</q> says he, <q>will I show the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> to you.</q> Could the Truth have shown anything else but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>29. He says therefore to him: <q>Behold, there shall stand up three kings in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>: and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and when he has got possession of his riches, he shall stand up against all the realms of Grecia. And a mighty king shall stand up, and shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will; and when his kingdom stands, it shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven.</q> These things we have already discussed above, when we discoursed upon the four beasts. But since Scripture now again sets them forth explicitly, we must also discourse upon them a second time, that we may not leave Scripture unused and unexplained.</p>
<p>30. <q>There shall stand up yet three kings,</q> he says, <q>in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all.</q> This has been fulfilled. For after Cyrus arose Darius, and then Artaxerxes. These were the three kings; (and) the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> is fulfilled. <q>And the fourth shall be far richer than they all.</q> Who is that but Darius, who reigned and made himself <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>—who was rich, and assailed all the realms of Greece? Against him rose Alexander of Macedon, who destroyed his kingdom; and after he had reduced the Persians, his own kingdom was divided toward the four winds of heaven. For Alexander at his death divided his kingdom into four principalities. <q>And a king shall stand up, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>31. For Antiochus became king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Syria</font></u></a>. He held the sovereignty in the 107th year of the kingdom of the Greeks. And in those same times indeed he made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against Ptolemy king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and conquered him, and won the power. On returning from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> he went up to Jerusalem, in the 103d year, and carrying off with him all the treasures of the Lord's house, he marched to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01570a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antioch</font></u></a>. And after two years of days the king sent his raiser of taxes into the cities of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>, to compel the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> to forsake the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of their fathers, and submit to the decrees of the king. And he came, and tried to compel them, saying, <q>Come forth, and do the commandment of the king, and you shall live.</q></p>
<p>32. But they said, <q>We will not come forth: neither will we do the king's commandment; we will die in our innocency: and he slew of them a thousand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>.</q> The things, therefore, which were spoken to the blessed Daniel are fulfilled: <q>And my servants shall be afflicted, and shall fall by famine, and by sword, and by captivity.</q> Daniel, however, adds: <q>And they shall be helped with a little help.</q> For at that time Matthias arose, and Judas Maccabaeus, and helped them, and delivered them from the hand of the Greeks.</p>
<p>33. That therefore was fulfilled which was spoken in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>. He proceeds then thus: <q>And the (king's) daughter of the South shall come to the king of the North to make an agreement with him; and the arms of him that brings her shall not stand; and she, too, shall be smitten, and shall fall, and he that brings her.</q> For this was a certain Ptolemais queen of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. At that time indeed she went forth with her two sons, Ptolemy and Philometor, to make an agreement with Antiochus king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Syria</font></u></a>; and when she came to Scythopolis, she was slain there. For he who brought her betrayed her. At that same time, the two brothers made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against each other, and Philometor was slain, and Ptolemy gained the power.</p>
<p>34. War, then, was again made by Ptolemy against Antiochus, (and) Antiochus met him. For thus says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>: <q>And the king of the South shall stand up against the king of the North, and her seed shall stand up against him.</q> And what seed but Ptolemy, who made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with Antiochus? And Antiochus having gone forth against him, and having failed to overcome him, had to flee, and returned to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01570a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antioch</font></u></a>, and collected a larger host. Ptolemy accordingly took his whole equipment, and carried it into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> is fulfilled, as Daniel says: And he shall carry off into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> their gods, and their cast-works, and all their precious (vessels of) gold.</p>
<p>35. And after these things Antiochus went forth a second time to make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against him, and overcome Ptolemy. And after these events Antiochus commenced hostilities again against the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, and dispatched one Nicanor with a large army to subdue the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, at the time when Judas, after the death of Matthias, ruled the people; and so forth, as is written in the Maccabees. These events having taken place, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says again: <q>And there shall stand up another king, and he shall prevail upon the earth; and the king of the South shall stand up, and he shall obtain his daughter to wife.</q></p>
<p>36. For it happened that there arose a certain Alexander, son of Philip. He withstood Antiochus at that time, and made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> upon him, and cut him off, and gained possession of the kingdom. Then he sent to Ptolemy king of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, saying, Give me your daughter Cleopatra to wife. And he gave her to Alexander to wife. And thus the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> is fulfilled, when it says: <q>And he shall obtain his daughter to wife.</q> And it says further: <q>And he shall corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife.</q> This also has been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> fulfilled. For after Ptolemy had given him his daughter, he returned, and saw the mighty and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> kingdom of Alexander. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">coveting</font></u></a> its possession, he spoke <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> to Alexander, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says: <q>And the two kings shall speak lies at (one) table.</q> And, in truth, Ptolemy betook himself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and collected a great army, and attacked the city at the time when Alexander had marched into Cilicia.</p>
<p>37. Ptolemy then invaded the country, and established garrisons throughout the cities; and on making himself master of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>, set out for his daughter, and sent letters to Demetrius in the islands, saying, Come and meet me here, and I will give you my daughter Cleopatra to wife, for Alexander has sought to kill me. Demetrius came accordingly, and Ptolemy received him, and gave him her who had been destined for Alexander. Thus is fulfilled that which is written: <q>And he shall corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife.</q> Alexander was slain. Then Ptolemy wore two crowns, that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Syria</font></u></a> and that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and died the third day after he had assumed them. Thus is fulfilled that which is written in Scripture: <q>And they shall not give him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the kingdom.</q> For he died, and received not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honour</font></u></a> from all as king.</p>
<p>38. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> then, after thus recounting the things which have taken place already, and been fulfilled in their times, declares yet another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> to us, while he points out the last times. For he says: <q>And there shall rise up another shameless king; and he shall exalt himself above every god, and shall magnify himself, and shall speak marvellous things, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; </q>and so forth. <q>And these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief (or principality) of the children of Ammon. And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the land; and the land of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> shall not escape. And he shall have power over the secret treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> and of the Libyans, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05566a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ethiopians</font></u></a> in their strongholds.</q></p>
<p>39. Thus, then, does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> set forth these things concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>, who shall be shameless, a war-maker, and despot, who, exalting himself above all kings and above every god, shall build the city of Jerusalem, and restore the sanctuary. Him the impious will worship as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and will bend to him the knee, thinking him to be the Christ. He shall cut off the two witnesses and forerunners of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, who proclaim His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> kingdom from heaven, as it is said: <q>And I will give (power) unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</q> As also it was announced to Daniel: <q>And one week shall confirm a covenant with many; and in the midst of the week it shall be that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> and oblation shall be removed</q>— that the one week might be shown to be divided into two. The two witnesses, then, shall preach three years and a half; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a> shall make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> during the test of the week, and desolate the world, that what is written may be fulfilled: <q>And they shall make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01046a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">abomination of desolation</font></u></a> for a thousand two hundred and ninety days.</q></p>
<p>40. Daniel has spoken, therefore, of two abominations; the one of destruction, and the other of desolation. What is that of destruction, but that which Antiochus established there at the time? And what is that of desolation, but that which shall be universal when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a> comes? <q>And there shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</q> For these are they who ally themselves with him on account of their kinship, and first address him as king. Those of Edom are the sons of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05527c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Esau</font></u></a>, who inhabit Mount Seir. And Moab and Ammon are they who are descended from his two daughters, as Isaiah also says: <q>And they shall fly (extend themselves) in the ships of strangers, and they shall also plunder the sea; and those from the east, and from the west, and the north, shall give them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honour</font></u></a>: and the children of Ammon shall first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> them.</q> He shall be proclaimed king by them, and shall be magnified by all, and shall prove himself an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01046a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">abomination of desolation</font></u></a> to the world, and shall reign for a thousand two hundred and ninety days. <q>Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days; </q>for when the abomination comes and makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, whosoever shall survive his days, and reach the forty-five days, while the other period of fifty days advances, to him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a> comes. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>, indeed, enters even into part of the fifty days, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> shall inherit the kingdom along with Christ.</p>
<p>41. These things being thus narrated, Daniel proceeds: <q>And, behold, there stood two men, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side; and they made answer to the man that stood upon the bank of the river, and said to him, How long shall it be to the end of these wonderful words which you have spoken? And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the water of the river; and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that lives for ever, that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and they shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> all these things when the dispersion is accomplished,</q></p>
<p>42. Who, then, were the two men who stood on the bank of the river, but the law and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>? And who was he who stood upon the water, but He concerning whom they prophesied of old, who in the last times was to be borne <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> to by the Father at the Jordan, and to be declared to the people boldly by John, <q>who wore the casty of the scribe about his loins, and was clothed with a linen coat of various colours? </q>These, therefore, interrogate Him, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that to Him were given all government and power, in order to learn accurately of Him when He will bring the judgment on the world, and when the things spoken by Him will be fulfilled. And He, desiring by all means to convince them, lifted His right hand and His left hand to heaven, and swore by Him that lives for ever. Who is He that swore, and by whom swore He? Manifestly the Son by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, saying, The Father lives for ever, but in a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished, they shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> all these things.</p>
<p>43. By the stretching forth of His two hands He signified His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11530a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passion</font></u></a>; and by mentioning <q>a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished,</q> He indicated the three years and a half of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>. For by <q>a time</q> He means a year, and by <q>times</q> two years, and by an <q>half time</q> half a year. These are the thousand two hundred and ninety days of which Daniel prophesied for the finishing of the passion, and the accomplishment of the dispersion when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a> comes. In those days they shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> all these things. And from the time of the removal of the continuous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> there are also reckoned one thousand two hundred and ninety days. (Then) iniquity shall abound, as the Lord also says: <q>Because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of many shall wax cold.</q> </p>
<p>44. And that divisions will arise when the falling away takes place, is without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>. And when divisions arise, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is chilled. The words, <q>Blessed is he that waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days,</q> have also their value, as the Lord said: <q>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</q> Wherefore let us by no means admit the falling away, lest iniquity abound, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01046a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">abomination of desolation</font></u></a>— that is, the adversary— overtake us. And He said to him, <q>unto evening</q>— that is, unto the consummation and morning. What is <q>morning? </q>The day of resurrection. For that is the beginning of another age, as the morning is the beginning of the day. And the thousand and four hundred days are the light of the world. For on the appearing of the light in the world (as He says, <q>I am the light of the world</q>), the sanctuary shall be purged, as he said, (of) the adversary. For it cannot by any means be purged but by his destruction.</p></div>

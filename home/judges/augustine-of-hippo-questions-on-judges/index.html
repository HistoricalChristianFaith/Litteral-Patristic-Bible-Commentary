I.)</strong> Introduction. - Towards the end of the book of Joshua, the story succinctly
continues its story until the time when the children of Israel fell into
idolatry. In the book of Judges, the order and detail of the events following
the death of Joshua are repeated. This book does not begin at the time of the
fall of the Israelites in idolatry, but at a previous time, in the course of
which the events which preceded this defection were fulfilled.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

1,1-3).</strong> And it came to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the children of
Israel inquired of the Lord, saying, Who shall come up with us as a commander
to the Canaanites to fight with them? And the Lord answered, Judah shall go up;
Look, I've put the country in your hands. " Here arises the question of
whether there was a man named Judah or if he called the tribe of Judah itself,
as is usually done. Those who consulted the Lord after the death of Joshua
looked for a leader, so some think that it is clearly the name of a man. Now,
as the Scripture does not usually name the chiefs, when it speaks of them,
without also mentioning the origin of their fathers, and it is clear that after
the death of Joshua the people of Israel had their leaders, the first of whom
was Gotoniel, son of Cener, is more accurate to say that, under the name of
Judah, the tribe of Judah is understood. For this tribe, in fact, the Lord
wanted to start crushing the Canaanites. And as the people consulted about
their leader, the Lord's response helped them to know that God did not want all
the people to make war with the Canaanites. And that's why he told them: Judah
will go up. And the Scripture continues the narration: And Judah said to his
brother Simeon. It is clear that one tribe speaks to another tribe, since those
sons of Jacob, called Judah and Simeon, were no longer living among their other
brothers, also designated by their own names. And the tribe of Judah said to
the tribe of Simeon: Go up with me to the land that has been my lot, and let us
make war with the Canaanites, and I will go with you to the land that has been
your lot. It is evident that the tribe of Judah asked another tribe for help to
return it when that tribe also began to need it in their territory.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

1,9-12).</strong> And Caleb said: "Whosoever beats the City of letters and takes
it, and I will give my daughter Acsa for a wife." This was also mentioned
in the book of Joshua Nave (Cf Jos 15,16). But one can rightly ask if this
happened while still living Joshua, and it is repeated now as a recapitulation,
or happened after his death, when it had already been said: Judah will go up,
and Judah had already begun to make war on the Canaanites , in whose war all
these things are narrated as happened. But it is more likely that it happened
after the death of Joshua, and then this is mentioned, as other things are
also, by prolepsis, that is, by anticipation. Now, in exposing the actions of
the tribe of Judah against the Canaanites, the order of the narrative remains
thus among the remaining warlike acts of Judah, of whom the Lord had said after
the death of Joshua: Judah will rise. And then the sons of Judah went down to
attack the Canaanites who lived in the mountain and in the south and in the
field. And Judah marched against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron, and
Hebron came forth from the opposite side-the name of Hebron before was
Cariatharbocsepher-and defeated Shesi and Akiman and Kolmi, sons of Enac. From
there they went up against the inhabitants of Dabir - the name of Dabir was
before City of letters. And Caleb said: "Whoever defeats the City of
letters and takes it, and I will give my daughter Acsa for a woman" (Jc
1.9-12). It is in this clear order of events that these events took place after
the death of Joshua. But then, when mentioning the cities given to Caleb, the
narrator, advancing as the opportunity presents itself, anticipates what
happened next. For the rest, I think that the Scripture has not intended to
mention without reason twice the fact that Caleb was willing to give his
daughter as a prize to the winner.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

1,18-19).</strong> But Judah did not conquer Gaza and its district, nor Ascalón and its
district, nor Accarón and its region, nor Azoto and its region. And the Lord
was with Judah. And he conquered the mountain, because he could not conquer the
inhabitants of the valley, because Rekab confronted them and had iron chariots.
When discussing in the book of Joshua Nave the passage that says: And the Lord
gave Israel all the earth, (Jos 21,43 41) when many of its regions still did
not possess them, I said that the fact that they had been given all the land
could be understood in the sense that the land that was not given them in
possession, was given them as a test. This appears here much more clearly,
since the cities are mentioned that Judah could not conquer, and, nevertheless,
it is said that the Lord was with Judah. He conquered the mountain, because
they could not conquer the inhabitants of the valley. Who does not understand,
therefore, that this also has something to do with the fact that the Lord was
with Judah, so that he would not be arrogant, suddenly getting all the
territory? With respect to what follows: For Rekab confronted them and had iron
chariots it has been said that he feared the chariots, but not the Lord who was
in Judah, but the tribe of Judah itself. If we inquire why Judah was afraid,
with whom the Lord was, we should interpret prudently that God, even being
propitious, destroys even in the hearts of his people the superabundance of
excessive prosperity to turn enemies to their own advantage, not only when the
enemies are defeated, but also when they are feared: the first, to reveal the
divine generosity; the second, to suppress human pride. Because, evidently, the
enemy of the saints is the angel of Satan, who, as the Apostle says, was given
to him to slap him, so that he would not be enraged by the magnitude of the
revelations (Cf 2Co 12,7).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

1,20).</strong> And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said. And he conquered from
there the three cities of the children of Enac and expelled from there the
three children of Enac. This was already said in the book of Joshua Nave (Cf

Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; and the Jebusites dwelt in Jerusalem with the
children of Benjamin to this day, when it is read above that that city was
conquered by Judah and set on fire, killing the Jebusites in it (Cf Jc 1,8.).
We must know that this city was common to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin,
as Josué Nave's own division of the territories shows. (Cf Jos 15,63; 18,28)
The city of Jebus is the same as Jerusalem (Cf Jc 19,10). Therefore, these two
tribes remained by the temple of the Lord, when the others, except Levi, who
was the priestly tribe, and received no territory in the division, separated
from the kingdom of Judah in the time of Jeroboam. One must therefore think
that Judah certainly conquered the city and burned it down, killing the people
who were there, but not all the Jebusites died, either because they were
outside the city, or because they were able to flee. And the children of
Benjamin, together with those of the tribe of Judah, who had that city in
common, lived in it together with the Jebusites that were left and which they
tolerated. Therefore, the phrase: The sons of Benjamin did not expel the
Jebusites, it must be understood in the sense that they could not or did not
want to make them tributary. Or at least, the phrase: They did not expel the
Jebusites, it means that Benjamin did not possess without them the territory
that belonged to them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

they were advancing the war then in remote places. For in Universal History it

gave this name to the place, because he wrote later, since, when the angel of
the Lord ascended to that place, he still did not call himself that. This name
means "weeping," because klauzmós, in Greek, means "weeping."
The reason is because the people wept there to hear this angel the words of the
Lord rebuking him for having disobeyed by not exterminating the people he had
ordered exterminate, people they had managed to overcome, preferring to make
tributary rather than exterminate and destroy them , as the Lord had commanded
(Cf Jos 17,12-14). And if they did so, either out of contempt of the Lord's
command, or out of fear that the enemies would force them to fight against
them, more to obtain their salvation courageously than to pay the tribute, they
undoubtedly sinned, or despised what the Lord He had ordered them, or not
believing that he could help them who had sent him. And he did not want to tell
him through Josue-if, even when he was alive, he had already ordered them to do
it, and he had not mentioned in advance what began to happen after he
died-precisely because he wanted to throw it on everyone. through the angel.
They had not yet done all of these, living Joshua; although some may have
already begun to do it. But it is more likely that none of this had begun to be
done by living Joshua Ship, and that the children of Israel, in the time of
Joshua, dominated the extent of the territory that would be enough for them to
settle, even though in the corresponding lot they had reasons to exterminate
even the adversaries, growing and becoming stronger. Therefore, after the death
of Joshua, when they had already become strong to carry out this, they
preferred to have them as tributaries, according to their decision, rather than
kill them and destroy them, according to the will of God. The angel was sent to
rebuke them. Now, the fact that the book by Joshua Nave mentioned it, I think
it is rather due to anticipation of what happened after the death of Joshua, or
because Joshua already knew, because of the prophetic spirit he had (Cf Jos
13,1-3), that he had It will happen like this, in case he is the one who wrote
the book called Josué Nave, or because if someone else wrote it, he already

Baal among the people of those regions corresponds to that of Jupiter, and that
of Astarte to that of Juno, which seems to be demonstrated also by the Punic
language. In effect, the Punic seem to designate Baal as the Lord; from where
it is thought that they call Baalsamen as the Lord of heaven; because Samen,
for the Punic, means heavens. And without a doubt they call Astarte to Juno. And
since these languages ​​do not differ much from one another, it is rightly
believed that the Scripture here says that the children of Israel served Baal
and the Astartes, because they served Jupiter and the Junos. And we should not
be surprised if he did not say to Astarte, that is, to Juno, but that he has
put this word in the plural, as if there were many Junos. The Scripture wanted
to indicate in this way a great amount of images, because each image of Juno
was called Juno. And that's why he wanted to say that there were so many Junos
how many were the images of the goddess. And I think he wanted to use the
singular for Jupiter and the plural for Juno because of variety. Because if I
had done so because of the number of images, I could also have spoken in the
plural of the Jupiter. Now, the plural name of the Junos is found in the Greek
text. In the Latin texts, on the other hand, it was in the singular. In the
text that is not based on the version of the Seventy, but in the Hebrew, we
read Astarot and not Baal, but Baales. And if by chance these names mean
something else in the Hebrew or Syriac language, it is certain that they were
strange and false gods, whom Israel was not to serve.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

wonders why it has been said: he sold, as if he had to understand that some
price has been given. In a psalm it is also read: You sold your people for
nothing (Sal 43,13). And the prophet says: You have been sold for nothing and
you will be rescued without money. Why then does it say: sold, if they were
"bucket" and "for nothing"? Why do not you say
"donated"? Is it perhaps an expression of the Scriptures, in such a
way that it could be called also sold to the one who is donated? Here the most
acceptable sense of the phrases: You have been sold for nothing and you have
sold your people for nothing, this is it: Those to whom you gave your people
were ungodly; they did not deserve that, serving God, the people would be given
to them in such a way that this cult would seem like the price. In relation to
the other phrase: And you will be rescued without money, it is not said
"for nothing", but without money, so that we understand that the
price of the ransom is what the apostle Peter says: For you have only rescued
with silver or with gold, but with a precious blood as of lamb without spot.
When the prophet says: You will be rescued without money, in silver he
understands all the money, because they would be rescued by the price of the

again throw out of his presence any of the towns left by Joshua, son of Nave;
and he left them to test Israel with them, whether or not they kept the way of
the Lord to go for him, as his parents had kept him. And the Lord left these
people so that he did not expel them quickly and did not deliver them into the
hands of Joshua (Jc 2,21-23). The cause of Joshua not exterminating all those
peoples with war is sufficiently demonstrated by these words of the Lord. If he
had, there would be no villages for the Israelites to have been tested. They
could be of use to them, if proven by them, they would not turn out to be
reprobate and, once they were not reprobate, as the Lord had ordered them not
to be, those peoples would be expelled from their presence if they lived there.
And it would not be necessary for the Israelites to practice war. It must be
noted that the words of the Lord reach here: Since these people have abandoned
my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and they have not obeyed my
voice, neither will I again expel from their presence any of their enemies. The
rest of the words are those of the writer, which explains why the Lord said
that he would not throw any of the people that Joshua, son of Nave, left alive.
Then he explains the cause of why they were left, adding the following: He left
them to test Israel with them, whether or not they kept the Lord's way to walk
through it, as their parents had kept them. By this is meant that the parents
who were with Joshua, that is, when Joshua lived, kept the way of the Lord. But

Joshua, and they began the transgressions that offended the Lord. To tempt
them, to prove them, those towns were alive and they were not exterminated by

later: the five satrapies of foreigners. They are spoken of more explicitly in
the books of the Kings (Jc 2,20). Satrapias is called a kind of small kingdoms,
in front of which were the satraps. Now, this name in those regions is or was a
reason for a certain honor. And the text continues: And to all the Canaanites

And it came to pass that Israel was tempted with these. It is as if he said:
This happened so that Israel would be tempted with them to know if they will
hear the commands of the Lord. Not for God to know, who knows all things
including future ones, (Cf Dn 13,42) but for them to know and their conscience
and glory or be convinced if they heard the commands of the Lord that he sent
to his parents through Moses. Well, as they knew that they had not obeyed God
in those nations that had remained, for their temptation, to exercise and test
them, that is why God said the things that the angel sent by God spoke more
clearly and expressly to those the Lord said shortly before: Since this people
abandoned my covenant, which I sent to their parents, and they did not obey my

Lord could keep this promise of his for the obedient ones, so that the
extermination of those nations, as the Israelites grew, would be partially
done, not allowing their multitude to leave deserted the lands from which the
adversaries would be exterminated. The phrase: And do not multiply against you
the beasts of the field, I would be very surprised if you did not refer to the

The answer is that it may not be a lie, because the Scripture usually also
calls word or message to a fact. And that was the way it was. The words: a

cows in the battle and that's why he is said to have killed six hundred men, in
addition to what he did with the cows he killed? And why calves? Is it normal
in the Greek language to call calves also those who are already big? It is said

problems. For how are the phrases to be understood: They chose new gods as

had given them help to conquer the cities of the princes, when they chose new
gods as barley bread. But from other passages of the Scriptures we know how

barley bread is of lower rank, when compared to wheat bread, but it also serves
to eat and is vital food. On the other hand, the new gods who chose, as they
say, those who abandoned the living God, can not be considered as food for the
soul, but rather as poison. It is possible that this comparison has to be taken
for what it is worth, in such a way that this statement is valid only because,
as often happens, that due to distaste the things to be chosen are rejected and
those that should be despised are rewarded, as blame for the bad disposition,
as if it were the weakness of boredom, being their God the true God, in the
false gods they chose only the fact that they were new, despising the truth.
And for that reason they chose a deadly food, as if it were barley bread,
without thinking that they would perish because of that bread, but that they
would even reach through it their life, as if it were a healthy food, although
of inferior value. Thus, the author used that comparison according to their
opinion and according to the weakness of the soul, not according to the truth.
Because these new gods can not be compared to any food of life.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

prophet, which is very rare in the Scriptures, but I do not think there is no
reason. Well, as after the words with which he rebuked the disobedience of the
people, the Scripture continues saying: And the angel of the Lord came and sat
under the oak that was in Ephra (Jc 6,11), it is not absurd to think that under
the name of the prophet man This angel is indicated, so that, after saying
these words, he has come to the aforementioned oak tree and has sat there. It
is a known fact that angels are usually called men, but it does not appear
easily or clearly that the man, who could be an angel, (Cf Gn 19,10) was called
a prophet. We read that the one who was a prophet is called an angel (Cf Mt
11,9-10). But if the prophetic words of the angels are known, that is, the
words with which they announced future things, why could not an angel be called
a prophet? However, as I said, there is no clear and explicit testimony on this

offer you a sacrifice, but he says to him: I will offer my sacrifice and I will
put it in your presence. Therefore, we must think that Gideon did not want to
offer his sacrifice to the angel, but through the angel. And this is made clear
by the angel himself, since he did not take the sacrifice from him, as if
offering it to him, but he says to him: Take the unleavened meats and bread and
put them next to that stone and pour the broth. When Gideon did it, the angel
of the Lord extended the end of the rod that was in his hand and touched the
meat and the unleavened bread, and fire came out of the stone and consumed the
unleavened meat and bread (Jc 6,20-21). In the same way, the angel also served
as minister in the sacrifice that Gideon offered, since the man minister, as a
man, would have lit the fire without a miracle, a fire that he kindled as an
angel in a miraculous way. Finally, Gideon knew then that it was the angel of
the Lord. The Scripture immediately adds the following: And Gideon saw that he
was the angel of the Lord. So, at first Gideon spoke with him as if he were a
man, although he believed that he was a man of God and wanted to offer
sacrifice before him as if he wanted to be helped by his holy presence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the place that God Himself had established. God, in effect, had forbidden
sacrifices to be offered outside his tabernacle, (Cf Dt 12,13) to which the
temple later happened. But in the time of Gideon the tabernacle of God was in
Shiloh, and therefore, only there sacrifices could legitimately be offered.
However, we must bear in mind that at the beginning Gideon had believed that
the angel was a prophet, and had consulted him as God about the offering of
sacrifice. If he had forbidden it, he would not have offered it; but as he
approved it, and agreed to be offered, Gideon followed the authority of God in
offering it. God established legitimate norms, so that he did not give rules to
himself, but to men. Therefore, everything that God commanded outside those
norms, it is to be assumed that they have fulfilled it, not the transgressors,
but the pious and obedient, as Abraham did when immolating his son (Cf Gn 22,2).
Elijah also offered sacrifices in this way outside the tabernacle of the Lord
to convince the priests of idols (Cf 1R 18,30.38). And this is supposed to be
done by the command of the Lord who commanded him to do so, as a prophet who
was, by revelation and inspiration. Although the custom of offering sacrifices
outside the tabernacle had grown so large, it seems that even Solomon offered
sacrifices on high and that his sacrifices were not reprobated, (Cf 1R 3,4-15)
notwithstanding the kings being told that among their praiseworthy works they
did not destroy the high places where the people used to offer sacrifices
against the law of God. And, on the other hand, the king who destroyed them
receives greater praise. In short, God tolerated more than forbade the custom
of his people to offer sacrifices outside his tabernacle, but they could not
offer themselves to foreign gods, but to the Lord God theirs, being propitious
even to those who offered them in this way.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Gideon did, who does not see that the angel did it in a prophetic way so that
in that prophecy the stone could be seen? And naturally the sacrifice was not
offered to that stone, but it is remembered that fire came out of it to consume
the sacrifice. Well, either the water that poured out through the desert (Cf Nm
20,11) the stone that was beaten or the fire signified the gift of the Holy
Spirit, which Christ the Lord poured out abundantly upon us. This gift is also
pointed out by the gospel through water, when the Lord says: If anyone is
thirsty, let him come and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture says,
will flow from his bosom rivers of living water. And the evangelist adds: This
told him of the Spirit that would receive those who believed in him (Jn 7,37-39).
This also means the fire that came upon the assembled, as the Scripture says:
They appeared some tongues spread out like fire, which landed on each of them (Acts
2,3). And the Lord himself says: I have come to bring fire to the earth (Lc
12,49).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

tongue turned out to be three hundred men. Most Latin codices do not have the
words with their hand (manu sua) but only with their language (lingua sua),
because they understood what was said before: (they licked) like dogs (Jc 7,5).
The Greek has both: with his hand, with his tongue, to indicate that the water
they caught with his hand was brought to his mouth. And this was similar to
what dogs do when they drink water, that they do not drink like cows, putting
their mouths in the water, but that they take it to their mouths with their
tongues, as it is believed that those men did too. That is, with the hand they
brought to the mouth water which they received on the language.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
translation done on the Hebrew expresses this more clearly with the following
words: Thus, the number of those who had licked the water, taking it with the
hand to the mouth, was of three hundred men. Men, of course, do not usually
drink water like that, so they take it with their tongues, like dogs, without
the help of their hands. But these men had been given the task of doing so.
When they went down to the water to drink, many drank bending the knee, which
was easier and was done with less effort. A few, on the other hand, because
they did not bend down by bending their knees, they drank like dogs, but the
water was carried to the mouth with the hand. The number of these men, who were
three hundred, implies the sign of the cross, because of the Greek letter T,
which means this number. And since it is a Greek letter, it is prefigured by
means of it that Gentiles will also believe more in the Crucified. Therefore,
under the name of the Greeks, the Apostle designates all the Gentiles, when he
says: First the Jew and the Greek (Rm 2,9), and the Jews and the Greeks (1Co
1,24), thus referring many times to the circumcision and the foreskin, because
among the languages ​​of Gentiles the Greek language stands out in such a way
that it appropriately designates everyone.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

number is also found in the servants of Abraham through whom he delivered his

In the fact that there are eighteen there -because those servants are said to
be three hundred and eighteen (Cf Gn 14,14.20), the time in which it would
happen, that is, the third age, which would take place under grace, seems to me
also signified. Because the first age took place before the law. The second,
under the law. The third, under grace. But each of the ages is meant by the
number six because of perfection, since three times six is ​​eighteen. For that
reason that woman had also been ill for eighteen years, and the Savior, seeing
her bent over, made him stand upright, and, as the Gospel says (Lc 13,11-13),
freed her from the bonds of the devil. For the fact that these men, by means of
which Gideon would overcome, were tested so that it was said that they
resembled dogs when drinking water, means that the Lord has chosen despicable
and ignoble things (Cf 1Co 1,28), since the dog It passes for being a
despicable animal, and for that reason it is said: It is not good to take bread
from children and give it to dogs (Mt 15,16). And David, to lower himself as a

garment, as many say, or rather a kind of shelter, which in Greek is called
epénduma or epomís, and that in Latin is usually translated by superhumeral
(superhumerale) and then the question arises spontaneously why Gideon did with
such amount of gold. The text reads as follows: The weight of the gold earrings
that she had ordered was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, not
counting the bracelets, the necklaces, and the purple dresses worn by the kings
of Midian; not counting the necklaces that had their camels around their necks.
And Gideon made him an efud and raised him up in his city, in Ofra. And all
Israel fornicated there after him and became a scandal for Gideon and his
house. How could you make a dress with so much gold? Samuel's mother also made
for her son, as we know, an ephod bar, which some have translated as "a
linen ephod," when he consecrated his son to the Lord to be raised in the
temple (Cf 1R 2,18). In this case it appears more clearly that it was a kind of
dress. Or does it say: He raised him in his city, so that we can get the
conclusion that it was made of gold? Because the text does not say: "He
put it on", but he did raise it, because it was so solid and so strong
that it could be lifted, that is, standing up.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">When
Gideon did this forbidden thing, all Israel fornicated after him, following him
against the law of God. When we get here we can rightly ask why the Scripture
calls fornication to what the people did, following and venerating this object,
since it was not an idol, that is, the image of a false and foreign god, but an
ephod, it is say, one of the sacred things of the tabernacle related to the
priestly dress. And the answer is that precisely because it was outside the
tabernacle, where these things that God had commanded were made there, it was
not lawful for anything like that to be done out there. That is why the
Scripture continues saying: And it became a scandal for Gideon and his house.
That is, to turn away from God, who was offended, because that too was in some
way a kind of idol, since it would be venerated as a god outside the tabernacle
of God, any object made by hand, when those same things that they were ordered
to do in the tabernacle should refer rather to the worship of God than to
consider those objects as god or that it was considered that they had to be worshiped
as the image of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">For the
rest, if we take the rhetorical phrase by which the whole is affirmed by the
part, by efud or efod all the things that Gideon did in his city similar to the
tabernacle of God to worship God could be understood. And precisely because the
ephod is a hallmark of priestly dignity, often reminiscent of Scripture (Cf Ex
28,2), it follows that Gideon's sin consisted of something similar to God's
worship being done outside the tabernacle of God. Not because Gideon had made
an ephod of pure gold with the intention of being worshiped, but because of the
gold from the booty he made things that belonged to the ornaments or
instruments of the sanctuary, all things signified by the ephod, by dignity, as
I said , of the priestly dress. For the ephod itself was not commanded to be
made of pure gold, if the ephod is the superhumeral of the priestly dress,
though it bears also some gold. God commanded him to make gold, and hyacinth,
and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. But the Seventy put all this so that,
remembering all the things that Gideon had received from the spoils, they would
conclude: And Gideon made him an ephod. And so, it seems as if they wanted to
say that the ephod was made with everything that alluded to before, when it
could also be interpreted that there is given the rhetorical figure of taking
the part for the whole. And then, the phrase: He made it an ephod, he would
say: "he made an ephod with it" or "he made it an ephod",
not using all that material in the ephod, but using only what he needed. The
translation done on the Hebrew says thus: And Gideon made an ephod with it. The
word used by the Seventy is "efud." The Hebrew text calls it
"ephod." But not all the priests used a superhumeral of this kind,
made of gold and of hyacinth and purple and scarlet and fine linen, but only
the high priest. Therefore, that dress that he made to Samuel his mother, as we
said before, was not like this, because, obviously, Samuel was not a high
priest when his mother gave him up to be raised as a child. That is why it was
called efud bar, as we said, or better, efud bat, as those who know Hebrew say,
and which is translated by efud of linen. I believe that Gideon did what was
the garment and principal ornament of the high priest by means of which the
other works of the sanctuary, which Gideon had done in his city outside the
tabernacle of God, were also signified. For this sin, that ephod became for him
and his house a reason for scandal, so that they died-as the Scripture says-as
many children as he had.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

forty years in Gideon's time, when after the victory with which he freed the
Hebrews, he made the gold of the booty the abomination and all Israel
prostituted himself after it and It was a scandal for him and his house. We
want to know, therefore, how after a great sin, committed by Gideon and the
people, he enjoyed the territory of forty years of peace, when Scripture
usually shows that if the people prostitute themselves away from the Lord God,
then the People tend to lose peace, not get it, and it is usually defeated by
enemies, not protected from attack. The answer is that Scripture, as it usually
does, says by prolepsis, that is, in advance, that Gideon made the ephod
against the law of God with the gold he had snatched from enemies defeated and
humiliated, because the Scripture prefers to say a single place where the gold
came from and what was done with it. But this sin happened later, at the end of
the days of Gideon, when they also followed the evils that later discover the
Scripture, after remembering the years of peace that the territory had enjoyed
in the time of Gideon, and those years he mentions them by recapitulation that
is, going back to the order that he had abandoned earlier when he spoke about
the scandal that had taken place at the last moment.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Israel separated themselves and played the harlot after the Baals, and
established Baalberith for themselves as an alliance for him to be their god.
It must be assumed that both the Baals and Baalberit were idols. After the
death of Gideon, the people committed a transgression and a fornication greater
than he had committed when he lived for the ephod, because although the ephod
had been made unlawfully, however it was something pertaining to the sacred
things of the tabernacle. On the other hand, this fornication after idols does
not even have the false defense of the father's religion. Therefore, even if
that ephod was not made until the end of Gideon's time, but had been done
before, God endured it with such patience that He allowed there to be peace in
the territory. For though they had done what he had forbidden, yet the people
to whom he had commanded that such a thing be done in his tabernacle and for
his honor had not been far from him. Now, however, God did not want to leave
without punishment more serious sins and a very clear fornication of the people
after the idols.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

trust in my protection; and if not, let fire come out of the bush and devour
the cedars of Lebanon (Jc 9,15). The meaning is obscure, but, making a proper

It is not easy to say if the word "sent" refers to what God commands
or allows. The word that appears here is sent. The Greek has exapésteilen, a
word that also appears in the psalms, where it is read: send (emitted) your
light (Sal 42,3). In spite of everything, our translators, when in Greek they
appear exaptereth in some places, have translated by "mandó" (misit)
and not by "sent" (emisit). It can also be interpreted in the sense
that God has sent an evil spirit, as if he wanted to go among them, that is, as
if he had given the evil spirit power to disturb the peace that was between
them. To such an extent it has not been considered as absurd that the Lord
could send an evil spirit to avenge justice, that some have even translated the
exapésteilen by "launched" (inmisit).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the city of Shechem, also contains the following: And now get up at night, you
and the people who are with you, and put an ambush in the field. And it will
happen that tomorrow, when the sun rises, you will hurry and launch yourself
against the city. What some Latin translators translate for "you will
hurry" (maturabis), others translate it for "madrugarás"
(manicabis). The Greek has a word that should be translated by two terms: you
will get up at dawn (elucidate surges). Perhaps it has been said here "you
will hurry" (maturabis), thinking about the time of the morning, although
this is also often said of any other time, when it comes to accelerating the
realization of a thing. As for the word manicabis, I must say that I do not
know that I am Latina. But it is strange that after saying: when the sun rises,
add: you will get up at dawn, when the dawn (diluculum), which in Greek
corresponds to orzros, means the time before sunrise, an expression commonly
used when it begins to lighten. Therefore, the word mane (of tomorrow), which
appears in the text, must be understood from the dawn itself (diluculum). Well,
it is added: when the sun rises, to say that it is not necessary to do it when
the sun has already risen, but when the sun shines at birth. Well, at dawn it
does not begin to get brighter than when the sunlight, which comes back, begins
to touch the part of the sky that we see from the east. From this it follows that
in the Gospel, too, one evangelist says that it was made at dawn, when the sky
was still dark, (Cf Jn 20,1) and another says that it happened when the sun
came out, (Cf Mc 16,2) because the dawn light itself, however small, it came,
evidently, from the sun that began to appear, that is, when the sun came
towards the exit and cast its radiance from the closeness of its presence. Some
fools do not believe that light is the light of the sun, but it is that light,
created at the beginning, before God made the sun on the fourth day.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

10,1).</strong> And after Abimelech arose to save Israel, Tolá, son of Puá, son of his
brother's father, a man of Issachar. The son of his paternal uncle is called
son of his brother's father, when it was said in a more orderly, usual and
clear son of his father's brother. He was, therefore, the son of his paternal
uncle, as is most clearly found in the translation made on Hebrew. Therefore,
the expression of the father of the brother (patris fratris) does not come from
the fact that the term pater is in the nominative: "father of the
brother" (pater fratris), but that frater is in the nominative:
"brother of the father" (patris frater) ) and this is what is called
paternal uncle. Because, whether it is put in nominative: «the father of the
brother», or if it is put in genitive »« the brother of the father »(patris
frater), in both cases they would be two genitive:« (son) of the father's
brother »(Patris fratris). In addition, another question arises. Abiméleq,
paternal uncle, was a man from Issachar, that is, a man from the tribe of
Issachar, since Abimelech had Gideon as his father, and Gideon was from the
tribe of Manasseh. For that reason, how Puá and Gideon were brothers so that
Puá could be paternal uncle of Abiméleq, whose son of his uncle, Tola, happened
to the own Abiméleq, according to this story? Thus, Gideon and Puá could have
the same mother, of whom they would have been born of different fathers, and
these brothers would be children of the same mother and not of the same father.
Because the women of some tribes used to marry men from other tribes. Therefore
Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin, gave his daughter to David, a man from
the tribe of Judah. And the priest Yóyada, a man of the tribe of Levi, married
the daughter of King Yoram, a man of the tribe of Judah. From this it follows
that Elizabeth and Mary, according to the Gospel, were relatives (Cf Lc 1,36),
although Elizabeth was of the daughters of Aaron. From this it follows that
some woman of the tribe of Levi and the daughters of Aaron married some man of
the tribe of Judah, so that there would be kinship between them, and thus the
Lord's flesh would not only be propagated from the royal lineage, but also of
the priestly lineage.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Ammon by the messengers, is this also: You will not inherit everything that
your God Kamós inherited for you, and we will not inherit everything that has
been inherited from you our Lord God? Some Latin translators have thought that
it should be translated like this: Will you not possess everything that your
god Kamós has given you as an inheritance? It can be seen here that Jephthah
confirmed that this god, named Kamós, had been able to give something to his
worshipers as an inheritance. But some translators say: You will not possess
what your God Kamós possessed? And this sounds like that god may have possessed
something. Does it perhaps mean that the nations are under the protection of
the angels, according to the song of Moses, a servant of God? (Cf Dt 32,8) Was
Kamos perhaps called that angel under whose protection the children of Ammon
were? Who would dare to affirm it, when it could be understood that this was
said according to the opinion of the former, because he believed that his god
possessed this or that he had given it to him in possession? In the Greek text
this sense appears clearer: Will not you inherit everything that your god Kamós
has inherited for you? That is to say, that in the expression for you (tibi) it
is understood how if it had been said: as it seems to you. For you, then, that
you think this, the god Kamós inherited, not because he could inherit
something. Finally, in the following words: And everything that the Lord our
God inherited does not say: he inherited for us. As if he wanted to say: as it
seems to us, but he really inherited from you, because he took it from them to
give it to them. We will inherit this, he ends up saying.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

11,29-35).</strong> About the sacrifice of the daughter of Jephthah, offered by his
father in holocaust to God, usually presents a great problem, very difficult to
solve. Jephthah had made a vow in the war, saying that if he won, he would
offer a burnt offering to anyone who came to him from his home (Cf Jc 11,30.31).
After the vote was made, he won, and, when his daughter presented himself, he
fulfilled what he had promised. For some, the problem is that they want to know
what this fact means and piously seek a solution. For others, who oppose with
absurd impiety these holy Scriptures, the problem is that they claim as the
main accusation against them the fact that the God of the law and the prophets
has been pleased even in human sacrifices. To the calumnies of these we
respond, first of all, by saying that to the God of the law and the prophets,
and, to put it more expressly, to the God of Abraham and to the God of Isaac
and to the God of Jacob (Cf Ex 3,16) he did not even like those sacrifices. in
which holocausts of animals were offered. But since they had a meaning and were
like shadows of future things, God wanted to recommend the things themselves
meant by these sacrifices. And this was also a convenient reason for those
sacrifices to be changed and not imposed now, even more, forbidden to offer
them, so that we would not think that God really delighted in such sacrifices
with a carnal affection.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But we
rightly wondered whether it was also convenient to indicate future things with
human sacrifices, not so that with them we should be horrified and fear in this
case the deaths of men, who anyway have to die anyway, if the that they would
welcome with them that they would be put in the hands of God for an eternal
reward. If this were true, this kind of sacrifice would not displease God. But
the Scripture itself testifies with sufficient clarity that these sacrifices
displease God. Because if, on the one hand, God wanted and commanded that all
the firstborn sons be consecrated to him and that they be his; on the other
hand, the firstborn of men were rescued (Cf Ex 13, 2.12.13), so that the people
would not believe that they had to sacrifice their children born in the first
place to God. In addition, this is even more clearly demonstrated by the fact
that God reproves human sacrifices in such a way that he forbids these same
sacrifices by detesting them in other nations and ordering his people not to
imitate them. For the text says: But when the Lord your God has exterminated
from your presence the nations in whose territory you are going to enter to
occupy it before you and have inherited them and lived in your territory, be
careful not to try to follow them, after have been exterminated from your
presence; Do not look for their gods, saying, "As these nations do with
their gods, so will I do." You shall not do so with the Lord your God, for
they have done with their gods the abominations that the Lord hates, because
they even burn their sons and daughters for their gods.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What can
be demonstrated with more evidence by these testimonies of Sacred Scripture and
by others that we omit that God, who has given the human race this Scripture,
not only does not love, but hates such sacrifices in which men sacrifice
themselves? He certainly loves those sacrifices and gives them a reward, when a
righteous man, who suffers iniquity, fights to the death for the truth or is
killed by the enemies whom he offends for defending justice, giving them back
property for evil, that is, love for hate. The Lord calls this the righteous
blood, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah (Cf Mt 23,35). And
above all, because he shed his blood for us and offered himself as a sacrifice
to God. He certainly offered himself so that his enemies would kill him for
defending justice. Thousands of martyrs, imitating Christ, fought to the death
for the truth, and were immolated by bitter enemies. Of these the Scripture
says: As gold in the crucible he tasted them and as a burnt offering, as a host
received them; That's why the Apostle says: Well, I'm already being immolated (2Tm
4,6).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But
Jephthah did not make his daughter a holocaust, like these, to the Lord, but he
did it as he had commanded that animal sacrifices be made and forbidden that
men be slain. More similar to this one seems to be what Abraham did, a
sacrifice that the Lord commanded in a singular way that was offered to him, (Cf
Gn 22,2-13) but without ordering with some general law that such sacrifices
were sometimes made to him, on the contrary, totally forbidding him to be do.
There is, then, a difference between what Jephthah did and what Abraham did,
because Abraham offered his son by virtue of a mandate, while Jephthah did what
the law prohibited and was not imposed by any special mandate. Furthermore, not
only later in his law, but also then, God manifested in Abraham's own son that
he did not delight in such sacrifices, since he forbade the father, whose faith
he had tried with the command, to kill his son and put at his disposal a ram to
make the sacrifice lawfully, according to the custom of the ancients, suitable
at that time.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But if
this raises to some the problem of knowing how Abraham could well believe that
God delighted in such sacrifices, if these things are offered to God
unlawfully, and for that reason he thinks that Jephthah could also well believe
that such sacrifice pleased God, consider First, it is one thing to make a vow
voluntarily, and another thing to obey a mandate. Because if something is sent
to a servant out of the usual in the house, established by the master, and he
does it with obedience worthy of praise, he does not have to be punished if he
pretends to do it spontaneously. On the other hand, Abraham had reason to
believe that he should not forgive his son's life because God had commanded
him, not believing that God took pleasure in such victims, but had sent him
that precisely to resurrect a sacrificed person and for half of it prove
something like God wise. Because even in the epistle called to the Hebrews this
is read about him and his faith is praised for having believed that God could
raise his son (Cf Hb 11,17-19). Jephthah, on the other hand, without God
sending him or asking him, and against a legitimate mandate from him,
spontaneously made the vow to offer a human sacrifice. For the text says thus:
And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said: "If you deliver me with
certainty to the children of Ammon in my power, whoever goes out from the doors
of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it
will be for the Lord, and I will offer it as a burnt offering" (Jc 11,30-31).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">With these
words he made no vow to offer an animal that could be sacrificed as a holocaust
according to the law. Because it is not usual, nor was it, that the leaders who
returned victorious from the war were presented with victories along the way.
But, as far as mute animals are concerned, dogs usually go out to meet their
masters, playing with soft servitude. But Jephthah would not think of the dogs
when he took his vow, so as not to give the impression that he had promised
something injurious to God, but even contemptible and unclean, according to the
law. For he did not say, whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet
me, I will offer it as a burnt offering, but said: Whoever comes out, I will
offer it. Undoubtedly, with these words, he thought of nothing more than a
human being. However, maybe he did not think about his only daughter. Now, at
such a glorious time for his father, who could go to meet him before his
daughter but perhaps his wife? In relation to the fact that I did not say whoever
(in feminine), but whoever (in masculine) comes out of the doors of my house,
it is necessary to say that the Scripture usually puts the masculine by both
genders; as, for example, referring to Abraham, the Scripture says: rising from
beside the dead, (Gn 23,3) when the dead woman was his.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Well, it
seems that the Scripture has not issued any judgment on this vow and on this
fact, as it very clearly stated when Abraham offered his son by God's command,
but only left it written for the readers to judge. Something similar happened
with what Judah, son of Jacob, did when he unknowingly slept with his
daughter-in-law; but as soon as he depended on it, he fornicated with her,
believing that she was a prostitute, (Cf Gn 38,15) and that the Scripture
neither approved nor reproved him, but left him to be esteemed and valued in
light of the justice and law of God. Well, as about the act of Jephthah the
Scripture of God has not issued a ruling either for or against, so that our
reason is exercised in the trial, we could say since that vote displeased God
and led him to take revenge of that act, allowing the father to be presented to
him just his only daughter - because if the father had expected this and wanted
it, upon seeing it, he would not have immediately broken his clothes or said:
Woe is me, my daughter, you are an impediment to me; you have become a
stumbling block before my eyes (Jc 11,35). Furthermore, despite the 60-day
period given to the daughter, the Lord did not prevent her, as she prevented
Abraham, from sacrificing her only daughter, allowing Jephthah to carry out
what he had promised and thus punish him. itself with a very serious loss (Cf
Jc 11,36-39), and, on the other hand, it would not placate God in any way with
the immolation of a human person. And therefore, it must be said that this father
was given the punishment so that the example of such a vote would not go
unpunished, and men would think or offer something great to God when they
offered him human victims, and what is even more horrible, they offered to
their own children, or that these vows were not true, but rather simulated, as
if, following the example of Abraham, those who had made the vow expected that
God would prevent the fulfillment of similar vows.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I would
affirm that we could say these things if they did not force us to abandon this
sentence, especially two testimonies of the divine Scriptures. And so, as far
as God allows, I will investigate not only with more diligence this matter,
remembered in the book of so much authority, but I will do it with more
caution, so as not to make a reckless judgment in any case. One of the
testimonies is found in the epistle to the Hebrews, where Jephthah is mentioned
among characters of such a nature that I would fear to blame him for something.
The text goes like this: And what else could I add? Well, I do not have time to
talk about Gideon, Baraq, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, who
by faith overcame kingdoms by acting in justice, got the promises (Hb 11,32.33).
The second testimony is found in the passage where these things are related to
the vow he made and its fulfillment. Well, before this fact, the Scripture
says: And the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he went through Gilead
and Manasseh and passed through the watchtower of Gilead, and from the
watchtower of Gilead he passed over to the sons of Ammon. And Jephta made a vow
to God (Jc 11,29.30). And then come the other things related to the vote. Well,
everything that happens next, seems to be interpreted as actions of the spirit
of the Lord, which had come on Jephthah. These testimonies prompt us to look
for the reason why what happened, rather than to easily fail what happened.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In the
first place, the text that I mentioned of the epistle to the Hebrews, not only
puts among those men worthy of praise that are mentioned there, to Jephthah,
but also to Gideon, of whom the Scripture also says: And the spirit of the Lord
comforted to Gideon (Jc 6,34). And yet the action of making an ephod with the
gold of booty and fornicating all Israel behind it, and becoming a scandal to
the house of Gideon, (Cf Jc 8,27) not only can we not praise it, but we do not
even doubt the most the minimum is to condemn it, since the Scripture clearly
issues a judgment against it there. But this does not cause any offense to the
spirit of the Lord, who comforted him to overcome so easily the enemies of his
people. Why, then, is it mentioned among them those who by faith overcame
kingdoms, working justice, if it is not because the Sacred Scripture, whose
faith and justice praises truth, is not for this reason prevented from also
revealing truth? his sins, if he knows any and he judges that it is convenient
to betray him? Because even in the very thing that Gideon himself tried with
the fleece, asking for a sign (Cf Jc 6,39), as he himself says, I do not know
if he would not have transgressed the precept that says: Do not tempt the Lord
your God (Dt 6,16). But the Scripture, even with its temptation to the Lord,
reveals what it wanted to predict, namely, that in the drenched fleece and in
the dry era all around it was prefigured, first, to the people of Israel, where
the saints were with heavenly grace, which was like spiritual rain. And then,
in the era drenched with the dry fleece, the Church was foreshadowed throughout
the world, which has, not in the fleece, as in a veil, but in the open, the
celestial grace, being that people first as alienated and dry from the dew of
one's own grace. But Gideon rightly deserved in the Epistle to the Hebrews such
a testimony among faithful men and that they do justice for his honest and
faithful life, in which we can believe that he died.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I would
not dare to say that after those words of Scripture: The spirit of the Lord
came upon Jephthah, (Jc 11,29) everything that comes next, like the vow he
made, the winning over of enemies, the fulfillment of the promise, all of it, I
say, it would have to be attributed to the spirit of the Lord, as if this
sacrifice also had to be considered as commanded by the Lord in a similar way
to how he sent it to Abraham. In relation to Gideon, this difference could
naturally be adduced, that, after the sin he committed, when he made the ephod
behind which all the people prostituted themselves, no prosperity of Gideon is
mentioned, and, instead, after making Jephthah the He obtained that
distinguished victory of his, for which he had made the vow, and, once
achieved, fulfilled what he had promised (Cf Jc 11,33.34). But we must pay
attention again to the fact that Gideon got salvation for the people, defeating
and defeating the enemies with a great massacre, although not after making the
ephod, and after having tempted the Lord, which, Certainly, it is a sin. The
text reads as follows: And Gideon said unto the Lord, Let not thy anger be
enraged against me; I will talk again and try again with the fleece (Jc 6,39).
Gideon feared, indeed, the wrath of God, because he knew that he sinned by
tempting God, something that God expressly forbids in his law. And yet, to this
sin of his followed the evidence of an admirable miracle and the great
prosperity of the victory and of the liberation of the people. Because God had
already determined to come to the aid of his afflicted people and he used the
spirit, not only faithful and pious, but also defective and delinquent of this
chief, whom he had taken to carry out this work and to predict what he wanted
and fulfill what he had said.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">God
granted many things to his people, not only through those who, although they
sinned, are counted among the righteous, also through Saul, absolutely
reprobate, because on him also came the spirit of God and prophesied, and not
when he worked rightly, but when he railed against David, good and innocent man
(Cf 1R 19,20-23). Because the spirit of the Lord acts through the good and the
bad, through those who know it and through those who do not know it, what he
knows and decides to do. For even through Caiaphas, a stalwart persecutor of
the Lord, he made a famous prophecy, without knowing what he was doing, because
he said that it was necessary for Christ to die for the people. Because who
acted but the spirit of the Lord, who tried to foretell the future, so that
Judge Gideon would come to mind precisely this of the fleece, first soaked and
then dry, and of the era, first dry and then soaked, to him who wanted to tempt
the Lord and who did not believe what he had already been told by his means
about the salvation of the people? The lack of faith must be attributed to his
weakness and his crime. But God also used his encouragement for what was
appropriate to indicate the human race, and we must understand that it refers
to the mercy of God and his admirable providence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But if one
says that Gideon did everything knowingly and said it by divine revelation, so
that through him those miracles would manifest, and that he did not fail in his
faith and that he believed what the Lord had already promised him, but that a
prophetic action he tried to prove in the fleece, and that his temptation was
not therefore guilty, nor was Jacob's deception (Cf Gn 27,15.16), and that what
he says to the Lord: Do not anger your anger against me (Jc 6,39), do not say
it precisely because I feared the wrath of God, but because he trusted that God
would not be angry in doing what he felt, dictating his spirit, felt that as a
prophet he had to do it, that individual - I repeat - to tell him what he
feels, provided that what When the Scripture reproaches, like the ephod,
whatever its meaning, do not dare to excuse it, saying that it is not a sin. In
relation to that other fact that three hundred men, at a sign of the cross,
received in equal numbers the corresponding clay pitchers and put torches in
them and, breaking the pitchers, the numerous lights that began to shine
suddenly terrified a Such a large crowd of enemies (Cf Jc 7,16-22), it must be
said that it seems as if Gideon did it on his own initiative. The Scripture, in
effect, does not say that the Lord advised him to do it. And yet, such a great
prodigy, who inspired him in his mind and in his decision to do it but the
Lord? This Lord, who foresaw that his saints would carry the treasure of
evangelical light in clay vessels, as the Apostle says: For we carry this
treasure in clay vessels (2Co 4,7). Well, in the suffering of martyrdom, as in
broken vessels, shone the greatest brilliance of his glory, which defeated the
impious enemies of the evangelical preaching with the sudden clarity of Christ
for them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In short,
the spirit of the Lord worked in the times of the prophets the prefiguration
and the announcement of future things, (Cf 1Co 12,6) either through those who
knew it, or through those who did not know it. But it can not be said that his
sins were not sins, because God, who knows how to use well even our ills, also
used his sins to signify the things he wanted. Therefore, if it was not sinful
to make or fulfill the vow to offer the sacrifice of a human life, or even the
sacrifice of a parricide precisely because it meant something great and
spiritual, then in vain God would have forbidden such things and would have
testified that he hated them , because even what he ordered to do certainly
refers to some meaning of spiritual and great things. And then, why should I
forbid those things, since they could be done lawfully by the very meaning of
one's own things, by which these things were also lawfully done? And the reason
is because human sacrifices, which mean something to be believed, do not please
God, when one is not killed by enemies because of justice, because he wanted to
live righteously or did not want to sin, but a man is immolated on the other
hand as host chosen as cattle.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So what?
Someone could say that the victims of animals, by the very fact that they had
already been used, although they too could refer to the meaning of spiritual
things, which would be given to them by those who understand this correctly,
made men less attentive to the investigation of the great mystery of Christ and
the Church. Therefore, God wanted to awaken, with an outstanding and unexpected
thing, the sleeping spirits of men. And this he did, above all, because he had
forbidden such sacrifices to be offered to him and he sought to be offered
something of that nature, so that admiration itself would generate a great
problem and the great problem would give rise to the desire of the mind. pious
to the investigation of the great mystery, and the pious mind of man,
scrutinizing the depth of the prophecy, will raise, as with a hook, the fish,
to Christ the Lord, from the depth of the Scriptures. I do not object to this
reason and consideration. But one thing is the question of the intention of the
one who makes the vow and another thing that of the providence of God, which
makes optimal use of any intention of the one who makes the vow. Wherefore, if
the spirit of the Lord, which came upon Jephthah, absolutely commanded Jephthah
to make the vow, which the Scripture does not make clear, however, if God,
whose commands it is not lawful to despise, commanded this, there is not only
They reprimand foolishness; they have to praise obedience. Because although man
kills himself, which is not lawful to do by human will and decision, it is
clear that we must think that this is done by obedience, rather than by malice,
if God has commanded it. I have already discussed enough about this question in
Book I of the De Civitate Dei. But if Jephta, following a human error, thought
that he should offer a human sacrifice, his sin about his only daughter was
certainly punished with justice - a thing that he himself seems to express
enough with his words when he says: Woe to a thousand, my daughter , you are an
impediment to me; you have become a stumbling block before my eyes, and when he
breaks his clothes; nevertheless, this error of his has also some praise for
the faith, because he feared God, fulfilling what he had promised, and did not
bow down to himself the judgment of divine judgment, or hoping that God would
forbid him, as he did with Abraham , or deciding to fulfill the will of God, by
understanding that he did not forbid it, instead of despising that will.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In spite
of everything, here we can also rightly inquire if it is better understood that
God does not want this to be done, and, thus, if it is not done, God is better
obeyed. Because God already showed that he did not want these sacrifices to be
made, not only in the son of Abraham, but also in the prohibition he imposed on
the law (Cf Gn 22,12). But if Jephthah had not done it for this reason, it
would seem that he had forgiven himself in his only daughter, instead of having
followed the will of God. Therefore, in the fact that the daughter came to meet
him, he understood better that God is avenger and submitted faithfully to just
punishment, fearing a more severe punishment, as if it were a distortion. For
Jephthah also believed that the soul of his daughter, good and virgin, would be
well received, because she had not offered herself to be immolated, but had not
opposed the vow and the will of her father and had followed the judgment of
God. Since death is not to be voluntarily procured to oneself, nor voluntarily
caused to another, neither should death be rejected when God sends it, since by
its decision we have to endure it at any moment. And no one who refuses to bear
it, works to avoid it altogether, but only strives to delay it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Now I will
investigate and briefly explain, with the help of God, what the spirit of the
Lord wanted to prefigure in this action through Jephta, or without knowing it,
or knowing it, or by his imprudence, or by his obedience, or for his offense,
or for his faith. For he warns us and urges us in a certain way this place of
the Sacred Scriptures to think of a strong and courageous man. For thus
describes the Scripture to Jephthah. His name means "He who opens."
Now, our Lord Jesus Christ, as the Gospel says, (Cf Lc 24,27) opened to his
disciples the meaning to understand the Scriptures (Lc 24,45). Jephthah was
condemned by his brothers and kicked out of his father's house, accusing him of
being the son of a prostitute (Cf Jc 11,2.3), as if they were born of a
legitimate wife. The same thing was done against the Lord by the chief priests
and the scribes and the Pharisees, who seemed to boast of the observance of the
law, accusing him as if he were a destroyer of the law and, therefore, as if he
were an illegitimate child. . Although she had taken her body from a holy
virgin, which the faithful know well, however, her mother, as far as her origin
is concerned, can also be called a Jewish synagogue. Check whoever the
prophetic books are and see how many times and with what harsh words and with
what indignation the Lord is accused that people of fornication, as if it were
a prostitute woman. In relation to this, we have even in this book of the
Judges those facts mentioned recently, one concerning the ephod that Gideon
did, following which, as we read, he fornicated all Israel (Cf Jc 8,27); and
the other, concerning that the Israelites went after the gods of the nations
among which they lived. Because of these sins, the wrath of God fell upon them,
so that the children of Ammon (Cf Jc 10,6-8) crushed them for eighteen years.
Well, were not those same priests and scribes and Pharisees born of the same
people of Israel, who, as we have said, were prefigured in those who expelled
Jephthah, like these to Christ the Lord, persecuting him as a non-legitimate
son? <span> </span></font><font size="3">But the similarity is insinuated,
as I have said, in the fact that they, as observers of the law, thought that
they had rightly expelled who seemed to act against the precepts of the same
law, as if they were the children. legitimate and he the son not legitimate.
According to this, it is said that these people fornicated, because by not
keeping the precepts, they did not show fidelity to God as a husband.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">On
Jephthah the following is said: And the sons of the wife grew and drove
Jephthah away. (Jc 11,2) The word grew up means "prevailed." This was
fulfilled in the Jews, who prevailed over the weakness of Christ, because he
wanted to suffer from them, in the Passion, what he had to suffer. Jacob also
prevailed over the angel with whom he struggled to predict this same and
meaning this same thing (Cf Gn 32,24-28). So they said to Jephthah, "You
shall have no inheritance in our father's house, because you are the son of a
prostitute." It is as if they were saying what the Gospel expresses: This
man, who thus breaks the Sabbath, (Jn 9,16) does not come from God. And they,
boasting of being the legitimate children, said to the Lord: We are not born of
fornication; we have God as our only father(Jn 8,41). And Jephthah fled from
the presence of his brothers and dwelt in the country of Tob (Jc 11,3). He
fled, because he hid his greatness. He fled, because he hid those who attacked
him. Because if they had known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of
glory (1Co 2,8). He fled, because they saw the weakness of the one who died;
but they did not see the power of the one who resurrected. But he dwelt in a
good land, or, to put it more explicitly, in "optimal" land. Because
the Greek term agazón means in Latin optimum (optimum), and this is the meaning
of "Tob". And here it seems to me that the resurrection of Christ
from the dead is meant. For what earth more optimal than the earthly body
clothed in the excellence of immortality and incorruption?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">With
regard to what is said of Jephthah, after fleeing from the presence of his
brothers and living in the land of Tob, he was joined by thieves and made raids
with him (Jc 11,3), we must say that before the Passion he was also objected to
the Lord to eat with the publicans and sinners, and he answered that it is not
the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick, (Cf Mt 9,11-12) and the Scripture
says that he was counted among the wicked, (Is 53,12) when he was crucified
among thieves, and one of they moved him from the cross to paradise (Cf Lc
23,33.43). However, after resurrecting and beginning to be in the land of Tob,
according to what we discussed above, around him were evil men who sought the
forgiveness of sins, and these men were with him, since they lived according to
its precepts. And this never ceased to happen until now and will continue to
happen as long as the wicked take refuge in him, so that he justifies the
wicked who are converted to him, and the wicked learn his ways (Cf Ps. 50,15).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And the
very fact that those who had despised Jephthah-he was also a Gileadite-should
turn to him and seek him out of their enemies, in what clear way it prefigures
and means that those who despised Christ, turned back to him, in him they find
salvation! Well, it is about those to whom the Apostle Peter reproaches them
for this same sin, as it is read in the Acts of the Apostles, (Cf Acts 2,22-37)
and those same ones he exhorts them to convert to the one they had persecuted,
and they were sorry They wished to obtain salvation from the one they had
alienated from themselves-for what is it to be freed from their enemies but to
be freed from their sins? For the Scripture says: Do penance and let each one
of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and your sins will be
forgiven you (Hch 2,38), or rather it is about that call of the people of
Israel that is expected for the end. Indeed, it seems that it is rather this
hypothesis, when it says: And it happened after the days (Jud 11,4). And this
means without a doubt after a while. And here it is insinuated that we must not
understand what happens in the recent Passion of the Lord, but what will happen
next. And it seems also related to this the fact that the elders of Gilead came
to Jephthah (Cf Jc ll,5), so that by senile age we understand that it is about
the later and last times. Gilead means "he who despises" or
"revelation." And both things agree quite well with this matter,
because first they despised the Lord and then they will be revealed to them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">On the
other hand, the fact that Jephthah was sought as the leader against the
children of Ammon to deliver the Israelites, defeating the Ammonites, since the
Israelites wanted to fight against them having Jephthah as their leader, and
like Ammon means « son of my people "or" people of sadness ", it
is clear that they are meant here or the enemies of the people themselves, who
were predicted to persevere in infidelity, or all the people without exception
predestinated to gehenna, where there will be for them weeping and gnashing of
teeth (Mt 25,30), as if it were a people of sadness. Although it can also be
called a town of sadness quite conveniently for the devil and his angels, or
because they get eternal misfortune for those they deceive, or because they
themselves are destined to eternal misfortune.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Jephthah
responds in the following manner to the elders of Gilead, certainly a way to
express the prophecy much more clearly: Are not you who hated me and expelled
me from my father's house and cast me away from you? And why do you come now,
when you are troubled? (Jc 11,7) A thing similar to this one is foreshadowed in
Joseph, despised by his brothers, who sold him (Cf Gn 37,38). When hunger took
hold of them, they came to their help and compassion (Cf Gn 42,44). But in the
case of Jephthah, the significance of future things appears much more clearly,
because they did not return to Jephthah precisely the brothers who threw him
out of the house, but the elders of Gilead, pleading with him on behalf of all
the people. In the same way, the people are called Israel, already in those who
lived then and reproved Christ, and in those who returned later to seek their
help. And this is said to an enemy people, who drag and keep long hatreds,
already in their ancestors, and in their descendants, and that becomes in the
end those that are to become: Are not you who hated me and expelled me? from my
father's house? This same thing was demonstrated in those who persecuted
Christ, because they expelled him from the house of David, in which his kingdom
will have no end (Lc 1,33).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And the
elders of Gilead said to. Jephta: "It's not like that; now we come to you (Jc
11,8.9).” It is as if the converted Jews said to Christ: We come then to
persecute you; we come now to follow you. They also affirm that he will be
their leader against the enemies. Jephta replies that he will be his boss if he
defeats their enemies, something that Gideon did not want, when they had wanted
it (Cf Jc 8,22); for he answers them: The Lord will be your master (Jc 8,23).
Under the title of head means the king, an institution that did not have those
people at the time of the Judges. They began to have a king with Saul (Cf 1R
10,1) and then with his successors, who are mentioned in the books of the
Kings. In Deuteronomy, when they are commanded what kind of king they should
have, if they want to have one (Cf Dt 17,14), they are not called a king, but a
prince. But as Jephthah meant the true king-a fact that was written even in the
title that was nailed to the cross, and which Pilate did not dare to remove or
amend (Cf Jn 19,19-22), that is why we thought he said to himself: I will be
your master (Jc 11,9). They had said: You will be our head (Jc 11,8); because
the head of the male is Christ (Cf 1Co 11,3), and Christ is the head of the
body of the Church (Cf Ef 5,23). Finally, after Jephthah freed them from all
enemies, they did not make him king, so that we understand that what was said
referred more to the prophecy about Christ than to Jephthah himself, from whom
the Scripture ends by saying: And Jephthah He judged Israel six years; and
Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city of Gilead. He judged
Israel like the other Judges. He did not reign there as a prince, like those
mentioned in the books of the Kings.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Jephthah,
once constituted head of the Israelites, already sent messengers to the
enemies, bringing before them a message of peace (Cf Jc 11, 1). In this fact it
is revealed what the Apostle says, in whom Christ spoke: If possible, as far as
it depends on you, have peace with all men (Rm 12,18). But, as I am in a great
hurry to finish, it is too long to expose all the things that Jephthah sent. As
for the meaning of future things, I think that we must understand them in such
a way that we can see in them the teaching of Christ, which instructs us about
our behavior, that is, how we have to live among those who have not been
called. according to the divine decision. For the Lord knows his people (2 Tm
2,19).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Now, that
Jephthah received the spirit of the Lord when he was going to defeat the
enemies means that the Holy Spirit would be given to the members of Christ.</font></span></p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">That
Jephthah traveled through Gilead and Manasseh and passed through the watchtower
of Gilead, and from the watchtower of Gilead he passed on to the other side of
the children of Ammon (Jc 11,29), it means that the members of Christ walk
towards the attainment of victory against the enemies. For Gilead means
"despiser," and Manasseh, "necessity." Therefore, the
despisers, the derogatory ones have to be overcome by those who progress. The
need must be overcome, lest the one who progresses, by overcoming the
despisers, yield to those who intimidate. We must also pass through the
watchtower of Gilead, because Gilead also means "revelation". A
watchtower is a height to look in the distance (prospicere) and to look with
disdain (despicere), that is, to see from above (desuper aspicere). Therefore,
the watchtower of Gilead seems to me to mean very well the pride of revelation.
And that is why the Apostle says: So that I should not be proud because of the
magnitude of the revelations (2Co 12,7). Then we must also transcend this law,
that is, we must not remain in it because of the danger of falling. Overcome
these things, easily overcome the enemies, as indicated by the following words:
And from the watchtower of Gilead passed to the other side of the children of
Ammon. These enemies have been talked about before.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And
Jephthah made a vow and said: "If you give me truly to the children of
Ammon in my hand, whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I
return in peace from the children of Ammon, it will be for the Lord and I will
offer it as a burnt offering". (Jc 11,30.31) Whichever person Jephthah had
thought, according to this passage and according to human thought, it does not
seem that he had thought of his only daughter; otherwise, he would not have
said, seeing her coming to meet him: Woe to me, my daughter; you are an
impediment to me; You have become a stumbling block before my eyes. The text
says: You are an impediment for me, as if I wanted to say that he is prevented
from doing this, to not fulfill what he had thought. But Jephthah, who had no
more children, who did he think the first one would come to? Did you think
maybe about his wife? Is it not true that God did not want this to be done and
not to go unpunished, so that no one in the future would dare to do it and to
prefigure, through his providence, the mystery of the Church, and for that very
reason that happened? Well, from both things the prophecy is derived: by what
he thought when making the vow, and by what happened when he did not want it.
If he thought of his wife, the Church is the wife of Christ: For this reason
man will leave his father and mother and will join his wife, and they will be
one flesh. This mystery is great, says the Apostle, but I say it about Christ
and the Church. Now, since Jephthah's wife could not be a virgin, in the fact
that she was presented with the daughter (instead of the wife) and not left
unpunished, the audacity of the one offering a forbidden sacrifice and the
virginity of church. And it is not far from the truth that, under the name of
the daughter, the Church itself is meant. Because from what other woman, if not
from this one, was the figure even the woman whom the Lord said, after healing
her for having touched the border of her dress: Child, your faith has saved
you; go in peace (Mt 9,20-22). And certainly, in a text that no one can doubt,
Christ called his disciples the children of the bridegroom, clearly indicating
that he was the bridegroom, saying: Can not the children of the bridegroom fast
when the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the husband will
be taken from them, and then they will fast (Mt 9,15). The holocaust will be
the Church, which the holy Apostle calls a chaste virgin (Cf 2Co 11,2), when in
the resurrection of the dead it will be done in all things what is written:
Death has been absorbed in victory. Then he will give the kingdom to God and to
the Father, a kingdom that is the Church, whose figure represented the same one
who made the vow. But as it will happen when the sixth age of the world has
been fulfilled, that is why a period of sixty days was requested to cry
virginity. The Church naturally gathers of all ages. The first is that which
goes from Adam to the flood; the second, from the flood -from Noah- to Abraham;
the third, from Abraham to David; the fourth, from David to the exile of
Babylon; the fifth, from the exile of Babylon to the birth of the virgin; the
sixth, from that fact to the end of the world. Throughout these six ages, as if
they were sixty days, the virgin holy Church cried her virginity. Because even
if it was about her virginity, there were sins to cry about. And because of
these sins, that virgin, totally whole, spread throughout the world, says every
day: (And) forgive us our debts (Mt 6,12). And it seems to me that the author
chose to call those sixty days two months because of two men: one, for whom
death has come; another, through whom the resurrection of the dead has come. Because
of these two men there is also talk of two Testaments.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The text
continues: It became the norm in Israel that from time to time the daughter of
Jephthah the Gileadite would regret four days a year (Jc 11,39.40). I think
that these words, after the holocaust has been made, do not mean anything about
eternal life, but refer to the past times of the Church, in which there were
blessed who mourned. In the four days the universality of the Church is represented,
because of the four parts of the world through which the Church is spread far
and wide. But, according to historical accuracy, I think the Israelites decreed
this only because they understood that in this matter the judgment of God had
taken place to punish the father, so that no one would dare in the future to
offer a sacrifice like this. . For why should a time of mourning and
lamentation be established, if that vow was a vow of joy?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But if we
also have to refer to the final judgment of God the fact that the people of
Ephraim were defeated by Jephthah according to those words of the Lord: But to
those who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them
before me. , then those forty-two thousand who perished in the battle, are not
mentioned here without some reason (Cf Jc 12,6). Well, as those two months,
because of the sixty days, mean the number six of the six ages of the world,
here too the number seven multiplied by six means this, referring to the six
ages of the world; because seven multiplied by six are forty-two. And Jephthah
himself did not in vain judge the people for six years.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

But now beware of drinking wine and fermented drink and do not eat anything
impure. What is an impure thing? Perhaps it is a relaxation of discipline,
which had begun to spread in Israel and which would have led people to eat
things forbidden by God, related to different animals (Cf Dt 14,3). Why should
we not believe that the people could have been much more inclined to do these
things precisely because they also committed sins related to the cult of idols?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

Regarding this, you may wonder if this woman told the truth, since this is not
read in the scene in which the angel spoke to her. You have to think that the
Scripture omitted it there and said here what it had omitted there. It should
also be noted that the mother does not say: I asked her what her name was and
she did not tell me her name; but it says: I asked him where he was from. And
this seems an incongruity with what follows: and he did not tell me his name.
Because the woman, when asked where she was from, had not asked her the name,
but the place or city where she was from, thinking she was a man. She said he
was a man of God, but looked like an angel because of the look or the dress,
that is, because he saw him as enlightened as she said. Well, if the sentence
is divided like this: I asked him where he was from and his name,
understanding: "I asked him", and then he adds: and he did not say

is said: From the womb (of his mother) until the day of his death, precisely
because in the law it was called nazir to whom he made a vow for a time,

it is not usually said that a kid is prepared more than when a sacrifice is

adds: If you prepare a holocaust (Jc 13,16), precisely because Manoe had said:
Let's prepare a kid in your presence. Not every sacrifice was a holocaust. The
holocaust did not eat anything, because it burned whole; That's why it was

13,15-23).</strong> What does Manoe say to his wife: We will die without remedy, because
we have seen God (Jc 13,22), after the angel, who spoke with Manoe and his
wife, told them who he was? Indeed, according to those words of the law, which
says: No one can see the face of God and continue to live (Ex 33,20), they
thought, as men, that they had seen God through such a great miracle, because
the angel, that little before he had spoken with them, like a man, he stood in
the fire of sacrifice.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But did
they believe that God was in the angel or did they believe that the angel was
God? The Scripture says: And Manoah took the kid of the goats and the sacrifice
offered him on the stone to the Lord, who does wonderful things. And Manoé and
his wife waited. And it came to pass that as the flame of the altar ascended
toward heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame. And Manoé and his
wife waited. And they fell face to the ground. And the angel of the Lord did
not continue appearing more Manoe and his wife. Then Manoé knew that he was the
angel of the Lord, and Manoé said to his wife: "We will die without
remedy, because we have seen God" (Jc 13,19-22). As in the previous words
Manoé did not say: we will die without remedy because we have seen an angel of
the Lord, but because we have seen God, the question arises whether they thought
that God was in the angel or called God the angel. The hypothesis that they
believed that it was God who was an angel can not be affirmed, since the
Scripture says expressly: Then Manoe knew that he was the angel of the Lord.
But why were they afraid to die? The Scripture in the Exodus had not said: no
one sees the face of an angel and will live, but God had said, speaking
himself: my face. Is it perhaps that Manoe, recognizing God in the presence of
the angel, was so disturbed that he feared he would die? His wife replied: If
the Lord had wanted to kill us, he would not have received the burnt offering
and the sacrifice from our hands, nor would he have made us known all these
things, nor would he have made us hear all this (Jc 13,23). Did they believe,
then, that the angel had received the sacrifice, because they saw him being in
the flame that came up from the altar, or did they think that the Lord accepted
the sacrifice because the angel did it to show himself as an angel? Whatever
the explanation, the angel had already said: But if you prepare a burnt
offering, you will offer it to the Lord (Jc 13,16), not to me, but to the Lord.
The fact that the angel was in the flame that came up from the altar seems to
mean rather that angel of the great council in the form of a servant, that is,
in the man in whom the sacrifice would fall, not who would receive it, but
would be himself the sacrifice itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

15,8-15).</strong> What does it mean in the Scripture that Samson struck the foreigners
with the tibia on the femur? Because who has the tibia on the femur since the
tibia goes from the knee down to the heel? Also, if you wanted to indicate the
place of the body in which Samson hit them, would all those who had been beaten
be hit in the same part of the body? If this is credible, then we could suspect
that Samson fought against his enemies with the tibia of some animal as a stake
and with it he would have hit them in the femur, similar to what is written
about Samson himself, who killed a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass.
But, as I said, it is not credible that in the fray Samson had only set himself
a place to hit his enemies. For the Scripture does not say: He struck them with
the tibia on the femur, but hit the tibia on the femur. It is evident that this
unusual expression presents a certain difficulty. It is said, as if he wanted
to say, that he hit them in a truly admirable way, that is, as if, stunned with
admiration, they put the tibia on the femur; the tibia, naturally, of one foot
on the femur of the other foot, as those who are stunned with admiration
usually sit down. It is as if he had said: He hit them on the cheek, that is,
with such a blow that they put their hand on his cheek with sad admiration. The
translation made on the Hebrew demonstrates quite clearly that this is the
meaning, for it says: He hit them with a great blow, so that they stupefied put
the surah on the femur. It is as if it were said: they put the tibia on the
femur, because the sura is on the back with the tibia.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

15,12).</strong> What does Samson say to the men of Judah: Swear to me that you will not
kill me, give me over to them, lest you come out against me? Some have
translated the phrase thus: Lest you come against me. Well, what Samson said,
that they did not kill him, means the same thing that is written in the book of
the Kings, when Solomon ordered that a man be killed with these words: Go and
meet him (1R 2,29). We do not understand this phrase because it is not a common
expression among us. Thus, when the military authorities say: Go away and
remove it, meaning to kill it, who understands that expression but who knows
its use? It is also common to say ourselves among us: it abbreviated the road,
to indicate that it killed him. And this phrase is not understood by anyone but
who is used to hearing it. This is the characteristic common to all
expressions: how languages ​​are not understood if they are not learned through
hearing and reading. Amen.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

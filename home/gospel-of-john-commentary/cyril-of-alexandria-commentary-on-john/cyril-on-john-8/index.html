For since He saw that the teachers were partners in folly with the multitudes and that the laughers were sick of the like with them they laughed at, drenched (so to speak) all of them in one night of unlearning and seeking to get hold of His Mystery yet finding nought at all, He brings forward the reason of tho want of understanding that is in them, crying, I <i>am the Light of the world. </i>Ye (He says) going through the whole holy Scripture and thinking to test the things spoken of Me through the Prophets, are far astray of the way of Life. And no marvel: for He is not in you Who revealeth mysteries and illumineth the whole world, and like a sun shineth into the hearts of them that receive Him. And needs must he who has not within him the Divine and spiritual Light surely walk in darkness and stumble on many absurdities therefrom.</p><p>But that the Only-Begotten is by Nature Light, as beaming forth from God the Father Who is by Nature Light, we have shewn at great length in the first book, on the words, <i>He was the Very Light.</i></p><p>But we must note again that He says that He is the Light not specially or solely of them of Israel, but of all <a name="p563"><span><font color="#000000">|563</font></span></a> <i>the world. </i>And herein He tells a thing most true: for He says that He it is Who infused into all the nature the light of understanding, and like some deposit of seed sowed the understanding befitting man in every one who is called into being, according to what is said of Him, <i>He was the Very Light Which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. </i>But I think, that there is something keen deep buried in the words. For if what He had said were not replete with something of this kind, He would have merely said, <i>I am the Light. </i>But since He hath added, <i>Of the world, </i>I think that now too He wills something of this sort to be hinted. <i>God </i>was <i>known in Judaea </i>alone, <i>in Israel </i>alone was <i>His Name great</i>; and all the rest of the earth a deep darkness filled, not one of those that were in the world possessing the Divine and heavenly Light, save only Israel.</p><p>But as then while all the nations in this world were together banished from the knowledge of God, and lay as it were in some rank of their own, <i>the Lord's portion was His people, Israel the cord of His inheritance:</i> so again when the spiritual sun was transferred unto the whole world, and the light taken away from them of Israel and removed unto the Gentiles, Israel was found to be external to all: for while they waited <i>for light darkness came to them, </i>as it is written, <i>awaiting brightness, they walked in gloom. </i>Not in vain then saith the Saviour when communing with the Pharisees, I <i>am the Light of the world, </i>for He threatens well that He will remove from Israel and will transfer the grace unto the whole world, and will spread forth the ray of Divine knowledge at last upon others.</p><p>But we must observe that although by His hearers He was seen as Man and with flesh, He does not say, In Me is the Light, but, I <i>am the Light, </i>that none divide Christ after the Economy of the Incarnation into a pair of sons: for <i>One Lord Jesus Christ, </i>as Paul saith, both before Flesh and with Flesh, and One and Alone in Verity Son is the Word of God the Father, even when He was made Man, not counted apart from the Temple that was taken of a woman: for His Own is the Body, and to wholly sever after the Incarnation, <a name="p564"><span><font color="#000000">|564</font></span></a> as regards Sonship, is not free from blasphemy. But we must know that though we say that the Word of God was made Flesh, we do not say that He was clad in flesh alone, but in the word flesh we signify the whole man.</p><p><i>He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</i></p><p>He is again persuading them on all sides to aim at hunting after what is profitable, and to desire rather to be led by His appointments, than to choose to follow their own unlearning and bereave themselves of everlasting life. He shews how great shall be the profit to those who are obedient to Him, seeing He is by Nature Good and <i>willeth all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. </i>But since He knew as God that they would gainsay, He fashions His speech after an elder image of things and from what had befallen their ancestors He declares plainly that the desire to follow Him will be to their great profit. It was written then of them of Israel, that <i>in the daytime also He led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire. </i>For when they were crossing the wide desert, hasting unto the Land of promise, a cloud was suspended over them like a roof in the day driving off the sun's flame, by Divine Counsel that is: by night a pillar of fire contending with the darkness and marking out to the travellers their un-erring road did lead them. For just as they who at that time followed the guiding and conducting fire, escaped straying, and were borne straight forward along their right and holy ground, recking nought of night or darkness: so <i>he that followeth Me, i. </i>e., who goeth in the track of My teachings, shall in no wise be in the dark, but shall gain <i>the light of life, </i>that is, the revelation of My mysteries able to lead him by the hand unto everlasting life. The Lord being a skillful workman in His speech, in no wise provokes the Pharisees, who rage and rave not a little, by telling them more openly that they shall both abide in the dark and shall die in their unbelief: but in other guise does He tell them this, transferring unto the better the force of His speech. <a name="p565"><span><font color="#000000">|565</font></span></a> For whereby He here promises that he who has chosen to <i>follow </i>Him <i>shall have the light of life, </i>by this same does He shew covertly, that by refusing to follow they shall have dearth of that light which availeth to recover them unto life. For is it not clear to all and unhesitatingly to be received, that to those who flee what cheers, the reverse:<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>must needs befall? True then was the word of our Saviour and undoubted that which was contrived through His skill.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>13    <i>The Pharisees therefore said, </i>Thou <i>bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not true.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Dull and slow is the Pharisee, and most hardly led unto the power of seeing the Godhead of the Lord: he errs again by reason of the flesh, and imagines nought beyond what he sees. For while seeing that He uses utterances beyond man and hearing words most God-befitting, he yet conceives of bare man, not looking to the illustriousness of the Godhead nor opening the eye of his understanding to look at Emmanuel. For to whom will it belong to say, I <i>am the light of the world, </i>save to One and Alone God That is by Nature? who of the holy Prophets dared to say such a word? what angel ever burst forth such a word? let them traverse the whole God-inspired Scripture and search into the sacred and Divine Word, and shew us this. But they making no account of what necessarily follows, deem that they ought to contradict, and advance hotly to what alone they know accurately, accusal out of love of fault-finding, For they depreciate Him as not being the Light of the world, accusing the things spoken by Him, affirming that <i>not true </i>is His <i>record. </i>For <i>they </i>are <i>wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge, </i>and suppose that they can overturn and that by chicanery His <i>record, </i>attempting to invalidate it from just merely our own customary ways, not by the commands of the Law.</p><p>For where does the Law (let them tell us) say that a man's testimony of himself is invalid? For wearisome I suppose and unendurable at times is a person's witnessing excellences to himself: and verily the most wise compiler <a name="p566"><span><font color="#000000">|566</font></span></a> of Proverbs saith, <i>Let thy neighbour praise thee and not thine own mouth, a stranger and not thine own lips. </i>Yet not altogether false is that which is said by any of himself. For let any of the Pharisees come forward, and let him tell us what we shall do when the blessed Samuel testifies most excellent things to his own self. For he is somewhere found to be making his defence to those of Israel and saying, <i>The Lord </i>is <i>witness against you and His anointed </i>is <i>witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hands. </i>But if the Law forbad any one to witness to himself, how (tell me) came Samuel to set it at nought, albeit the Divine Scripture saith of him, <i>Holy </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#14" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">14</font></u></sup></a> <i>was Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, they called upon the Lord and He answered them, in the pillar of the cloud did He speak unto them, they kept His testimonies and the ordinances that He gave them. </i>Seest thou how he was conjoined with Moses as having virtue commensurate with him, and is witnessed to by the Spirit as an accurate keeper of the Law? How then did he trangress the Law by witnessing to himself, will one say? But he did not trangress it; for he is witnessed to as keeping it, and he hath witnessed to himself. The Law then forbids to none to witness to himself. And moreover what shall we say, when we see the blessed David saying, <i>O Lord my God, if I did this, if I recompensed those that recompensed me evil? </i>yea moreover the blessed Jeremy saith, <i>O Lord God of hosts, I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, but was circumspect because of Thy Hand:</i> and the most wise Paul again, though <i>taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, </i>as himself too testified, openly cries out, <i>For I am conscious of nought of myself.</i></p><p>Let the Pharisee therefore say again of each of these, Thou <i>bearest record of thyself, thy record is not true, </i>even though to those who refuse not to chide the very Lord of all, <a name="p567"><span><font color="#000000">|567</font></span></a> the behaving most ill to the rest is a matter of course. But this we say, resuming again what we were saying, that the contradiction of the Pharisees is no necessary one taken out of the ordinances of the Law, but made only out of what prevails in common custom, and from the habit not seeming to be one befitting good people. And their contradiction out of the Law is rather railing, to steal away those who<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>are already marvelling at Him and are persuaded that they ought to believe. For they revile Him as not true, and damaging the credit of what He just now said, the wretched ones draw forth the destruction of blasphemy upon their own heads.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>14   <i>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though </i>I <i>hear record of Myself, My record is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>On Christ saying that He is what He is by Nature and truly (for He openly declared, I <i>am the Light of the world) </i>the multitude of the Pharisees unrecking of danger deemed that He spake falsely. For in their exceeding folly they knew not that when some set forth their own nature and tell what is essentially inherent in them, we shall not, if we think aright, suppose that they do so out of boasting, nor shall we say that they are bent on hunting vain-glory, but rather that they declare what they really are. As for example we say that when an angel pointing out his own nature says, I am an angel; when a man shewing what he is says, I am a man: yea, if one should clothe with voice the sun, and it teaching the property of its nature should say, I hasting around the circuit of the heaven, let forth bright light to those on the earth:----one would not reasonably suppose, that it were witnessing to itself things not its, but what it really was by nature. In the same way (I deem) as to our Saviour Christ too, even though He says that He is the Light, He will say the truth, and will be found boasting not less than they in things external to Him.</p><p>The many therefore living in ill-instructedness, not understanding Emmanuel, suppose that He is vain-glorious <a name="p568"><span><font color="#000000">|568</font></span></a> and attack Him as though one of us, and have not shuddered to say, <i>Thy record is not true, </i>to Him Who cannot lie, for <i>guile was not found in His Mouth, </i>as it is written. But it behoved Him to lead by the hand them who were astray, having fallen away exceedingly from the truth, and gone away from right reasoning, and in all forbearance to tell them that they had missed of what was becoming, unholily ascribing the love of even lying to Him Who is from above and begotten of God the Father. For <i>true </i>(He says) <i>is My record, </i>even <i>though </i>I <i>hear record of Myself. </i>For in men is sometimes seen the desire from self-love of witnessing things most excellent to themselves, even though they have them not (for prone to ill is their nature); but to Me (He says) belongs not the power of being sick of the same ills as those on the earth. For <i>I know whence I </i>am, Light of Light and Very God of Very God the Father, having the Nature that is beyond the reach of infirmity. For even though (He says) I became Man because of My Love for men, yet not on this account shall I be deemed bereft of God-befitting Dignity, but I remain what I am by Nature, God. A clear proof of this, is My knowing <i>whither I go: </i>for I shall ascend unto the heavens to the Father of Whom I am. This I suppose one would say pertained not to a man as we are, but to Him Who is by Nature God even though He became Man. Hence the words <i>I know whence I </i>am, indicates that the Son is by Nature of the Father, and the <i>whither I go, </i>a demonstration of God-befitting Authority (for He will ascend as God, <i>above </i>the <i>heavens, </i>as Paul saith); yet hath it some fit threat, even if not altogether clear, against the impiety of the Jews. For that He shall full soon depart altogether from their race, does He here evidently say; and leaving them in dearth of the Divine Light, will prepare them for being in ignorance and deep darkness, as He shews them elsewhere more clearly: for He says, <i>While ye have the Light, walk in the light lest darkness come upon you.</i> <a name="p569"><span><font color="#000000">|569</font></span></a> </p><blockquote><blockquote><p>15    YE<i> judge after the flesh,</i> I <i>judge no man.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We shall again find the Lord of all using gentleness most worthy of love; for not with equal wrath does He repay those who blaspheme Him, albeit knowing that they ought to participate in bitter punishment: but imitating the more gentle of physicians, He will (I deem) in this too be rightly marvelled at. For they often make no account of the slights of the sick, but forbearing most patiently make their skill helpful to them, curing what gives them pain, and railed at at times, they explaining what is for the good of health persuade them to be diligent in what is for their good and make known the cause of their sickness. And the Lord Jesus Christ both bears with those who blaspheme Him and reviled He does them good, He binds up the wounds of them who insult Him: yea and most clearly counts up to them the causes of their unbelief in Him, whence their sickness befell them. For YE (He says) <i>judge after the flesh, </i>i. e., ye err, and with great reason, since ye look to <i>this flesh </i>alone, albeit ye ought far rather to give heed to the magnificence of the deeds: believing that I am such an one as you because I am clothed in your flesh, ye have been greatly deceived, and not contemplating the deep mystery of the Economy with Flesh, ye put forth a most ill-advised judgment against Me, saying that the Truth lies. But <i>I </i>shall put off judging you until another time, for <i>God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved. </i></p><p>I think then that the question before us has been solved not amiss: but one may going through other thoughts also make the sense clear as far as we are able. YE (He says) <i>judge after the flesh, </i>I <i>judge no man. </i>Having nought at all (He says) to find fault with and not able to reasonably blame My Wonder-workings, ye depreciate them only on account of the flesh, and because I am seen a Man as you, ye impiously class Me as nothing. But <i>I </i>(He says) do not for this condemn you; for not because ye are men by nature, shall I therefore esteem you as nothing nor for this shall ye render account to the Judge.    I find not fault with <a name="p570"><span><font color="#000000">|570</font></span></a> the nature, I condemn not Mine Own creation, I say not that there is any transgression in man from his being man. Yet <i>ye </i>by reason of the flesh esteem Me as nought, and for this did ye condemn Me: but <i>I </i>have not so reckoned of you, but knowing that a great and honourable thing is man even though he be made of earth, albeit Very God and in the Form of the Father Who begat Me, I humbled Myself taking servant's form and made Man: in respect of which alone am I now condemned by you, albeit Myself condemning no man for this. <i>And if I judge My judgment is </i>just and <i>true because I am not alone but </i>I <i>and the Father that sent Me.</i></p><p>"Doth then," will haply one say of those who think contrary to the doctrines of the Church, "the Son know how to judge aright, only for this reason, that the Father is with Him when He does so? This being so (and that in truth) what yet hinders from saying that the Son is in a way directed unto uprightness through the Will of the Father, not possessing this in perfectness, nor able of Himself to act irreproachably?"</p><p>What then shall WE too respond to their words? Impious, sirs, is your idea and most befitting Jewish folly alone, for not as though not possessing the power of judging rightly of Himself, does the Son so speak; for the Psalmist will testify to Him saying in the Spirit, <i>God is a Righteous Judge. </i>And that none other save He is Judge, Himself will be our witness, saying in the Gospels, <i>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment unto the Son. </i>Hath then God the Father given the judgment to one who knoweth not to judge rightly? But any one (I suppose) would attribute to the uttermost folly so to deem of the Righteousness of the Father, i. e. the Son. For the Father knoweth His own Offspring and gave Him judgment, and by giving it, clearly testifies His Power to judge aright. It is therefore most manifest, that not as being impotent to judge justly does He say that the Father co-judges with Him, but the words are replete with some thoughts akin to those above and in sequence. <a name="p571"><span><font color="#000000">|571</font></span></a> </p><p>What then He wishes to make known, we will clearly say. YE (He says) O leaders and teachers of the Jews, made an evil and most unjust judgment against Me: for by reason of only the flesh, ye deem ye ought to esteem Me as nothing, although I am by Nature God. But <i>I </i>when I begin to judge of you, shall not put forth such a judgment against you, for not because ye are men by nature, shall I therefore deem it fit to condemn you: but having the Father in all things Co-willer and Co-judge, I condemn you justly. And why? Ye did not receive Him Who cometh from Heaven, ye have not ceased to insult Him That was sent to you from the Father, ye depreciated Me Who came for the salvation of all, for merely the flesh's sake, spurning far the Law which was ever dear to you. For where (tell me) doth Moses bid you condemn any because he was a man by nature? YE therefore judge and reckon unjustly: for ye have not the Law as your Co-willer herein, but by yourselves are bold to every daring deed, having not the inspiration of the Divine will: but I not so, for having in Myself the Father as My Assessor and Co-approver in all things that concern you, I judge most justly in giving up to desolation your whole country, and burying it in the misfortunes of war, yea in expelling from the very kingdom of Heaven those who have so raged against Him who willeth to save them, and who for this cause came in man's form.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>17, 18 <i>And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true: </i>I <i>am one that bear witness of Myself and the Father too That sent Me beareth witness of Me.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having said that God the Father will co-judge and co-condemn those who blaspheme against Him, He taketh the pair of Persons unto something else that is profitable. For <i>I </i>(He says) will not refuse to tell you what I am by Nature. For <i>I am the Light of the world. </i>And <i>I </i>would not seem to any to be fond of boasting: for not in external endowments but in those that accrue to Me Essentially do I glory.    But if in saying this, I seem to you not competent <a name="p572"><span><font color="#000000">|572</font></span></a> to receive from you approval for truth, because I am alone and have witnessed to Myself, I will take to Me God the Father co-working and co-witnessing to My Endowments. For He co-works with Me (He says) as ye see, and co-operates. For as far as regards human nature, <i>I </i>should not do any thing at all, if I possessed not the being God by Nature: as far as regards My being of the Father, and having in Myself the Father, I confess that I can accomplish all things, and am witnessed to by the Nature of Him who begat Me: for as having Him in Myself by means of Sameness of Nature, I come to the achieving of all things unhindered. For our Lord Jesus Christ hath of the Divine Nature all-creative Power as God even though He became Man, and He is witnessed to by the Father, having Him Co-worker in all things according as is said by Him, <i>Of Myself I do nothing, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, Himself doeth the works. </i>But we deem that the Father co-works with the Son, not as introducing some other power of His own for the achievement of the things done, to one who was wanting in power (for if we thus conceive, we shall concede that both the Power of the Father and that of the Son are surely imperfect, if ought of miracle be wrought by Them Both, as though One were not sufficient for the need) but conceiving of, and taking the words in more pious wise, we shall say that since there is in Father and Son One Godhead, and the un-differing Authority and Power of the Same Nature, the works of the Son will surely be those of God the Father, those again of God the Father, the works of the Son.</p><p>But He saith, <i>I do nothing of Myself, </i>not as though a servant or under-worker, or in position of a learner, and waiting to be commanded by the Father, or instructed in order to accomplish wonders: but rather signifying with all precision, that having sprung of the Essence of God the Father, and like Light produced Ineffably and without beginning from His Innermost Bosom and Eternally co-with Him, and conceived of and being the Image and Impress of His Person, He hath the same Mind so to speak with Him, <a name="p573"><span><font color="#000000">|573</font></span></a> and the same energy in everything. For that He might clearly teach that He is Co-willer in all things with Him Who begat Him, He says, <i>I do nothing of Myself. </i>Just as though He said, I am not turned out to any private will of My own, which is not in God the Father. Whatever the Nature of the Father wills and judges, this same is surely in Me too, since I beamed forth of His Bosom, and am the Very Fruit of His Essence.</p><p>Hard then are these things to explain, and that which is unattainable by the very understanding may not without difficulty be unfolded through the tongue: nevertheless bringing such things as far as in us lays to a pious view,<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>we shall gain to ourselves heavenly reward, and thus preserve our mind unwounded and unmoved by turnings aside unto ought else.</p><p>But we must note that the Saviour adding and crying to the Jews, <i>And in your Law is it written, </i>persuades the Pharisees as of necessity to admit the pair of Persons. For I (He says) <i>bear witness of Myself, and the Father </i>will be with Me herein: will therefore the pair of witnesses confirmed by the book of the Law, be accepted by you, or will ye again, looking only to your envy at Me, not keep even the Law that ye admire?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>19    <i>They said therefore unto Him, Where is Thy Father?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>In this too most especially may one, I deem, and with good reason cry out against the stolidity of the Jews, uttering that word of the Prophet, <i>Behold O foolish people and without heart. </i>For after much discourse and often with them from our Saviour Christ, Who over and over makes mention of God the Father in Heaven, the wretched ones sink down into so great folly as to dare to say, <i>Where is Thy Father? </i>For they think nought at all of Him Who is His God and Father in the Heavens, but look round at and seek for Joseph, believing him to be Christ's father and no otherwise. Thou seest then how they have been with reason called a people verily foolish and heartless: for able not so much as  to raise the eye  of their understanding above <a name="p574"><span><font color="#000000">|574</font></span></a> things of earth, they shew that true it is which was said of them, <i>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not, and bow Thou down their back alway. </i>For of irrational creatures is the back bowed, for they have this form from nature, and there is nothing of uprightness in them. And the mind of the Jews has become in some way like the beasts and has declined ever downwards, seeing nothing of heavenly things. For shall we not by the very fact itself, instructed aright in this matter, think and judge truly concerning them? for if they had at all thought of God the Father in Heaven, how would they have sought in place the Unembodied? how (tell me) would they, saying most unadvisedly of God Who filleth all things, <i>Where is </i>He, not fight with the whole Divine Scripture, albeit the Divine-speaking Psalmist, going through (as he was able) his words about God, and attributing to Him the power of filling all things, says, <i>Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, and from Thy Presence whither shall I flee? if I ascend up into heaven, </i>THOU <i>art there, if I go down to hell, behold Thou, if I take my wings at morning and depart unto the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy Hand lead me and Thy Right Hand shall hold me. </i>Yea and God Himself Who is over all, shewing clearly that He possesseth not nature circumscribed by space, saith to those so unholy Jews, <i>Do not </i>I <i>fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord? what house will ye build Me, or what the place of My rest? Heaven </i>is <i>My Throne and earth My footstool. </i>One may therefore see the Jews in all things without understanding, when they say to the Saviour Christ, <i>Where is Thy Father? </i>except they say this of His reputed father after the flesh, in this too doting.</p><p>But it is likely that the words of the Jews had some other deep meaning. For since they thought that the holy Virgin had committed adultery before marriage, therefore they rail most bitterly against Christ as not even knowing from whom He is, saying, <i>Where is Thy father? </i>doting. <a name="p575"><span><font color="#000000">|575</font></span></a> </p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Jesus answered, Neither Me do ye know nor My Father, if ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>True is the word and in no respect can it be accused of lying. For they who indeed suppose Christ to be of Joseph, or of fornication, and who know not that the Word beamed forth of God the Father, how will they not with reason hear, <i>Neither Me do ye know nor My Father? </i>For if they had known the Word that beamed forth of God the Father, and was for our sakes made in the flesh, according to the Divine Scripture, they would have known Him too Who begat Him. For most accurate knowledge of the Father is through the Son implanted in the understanding of the more zealous after learning, as He too affirmed, saying unto God the Father, <i>I manifested Thy Name to the men, </i>and again, <i>Thy knowledge was made marvellous by Me. </i>For since we know the Son, we know by Him Him Who begat Him. For through Both is brought in the perception of the Other: and when the Father is mentioned, the memory of His Offspring surely comes in with it, and again with the signification of the Son, the Name of Him Who begat Him comes in too. For therefore is the Son a Door (so to speak) and way leading unto the knowledge of the Father. And so does He say, <i>No man cometh unto the Father but by Me. </i>For we must needs first learn (as is possible) what the Son is by Nature; and so, as from Image and most accurate Impress, understand well the Archetype. For in the Son is the Father seen, and in the Nature of His own Offspring as in a mirror, is He Perfectly seen. But if this be true, as it is true, let the God-opposing Arian blush. For needs must the Impress of His Essence be in every way and manner like to Him, lest ought else than what the Father is, be supposed to be perfectly beaming forth in the Son. And if He love to be known in the Son and to shine forth in Him, He knows (I suppose) of a surety that He is Consubstantial too, and in nothing whatever inferior to His Own inherent Glory: for He would not have chosen to be believed to be in lesser case than He is by Nature.    And since He loves <a name="p576"><span><font color="#000000">|576</font></span></a> and has willed this, how must we not needs now confess that the Son is every way like the Father, in order that through Him we may know Him also That begat Him, as we have already said, ascending aright from the Image to the Archetype, and be able to have an unblameable conception of the Holy Trinity?</p><p>Thus then he who knoweth the Son, knoweth the Father too. But consider how the Lord after having said the truth to the Jews, interweaves some other device also in His speech; for having said clearly, <i>Neither Me do ye know nor My Father, </i>He draws gently off the mind of the Jews, that they should not think only humanly of Him, nor suppose that He is in truth the son of Joseph who was taken economically but should rather seek and enquire Who is the Word in Flesh, Who His Father by Nature. <a name="p577"><span><font color="#000000">|577</font></span></a> </p><blockquote><p><b>CHAPTER <span><a name="C3"></a>III.</span> That no work of Jewish might was the Suffering on the Cross, nor did Christ die from the tyranny of any, but Himself of His own will suffered this for us that He might save all.</b></p><blockquote><p>20    <i>These words spake He in the Treasury as He taught in the Temple, and no man laid hands on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The most wise Evangelist profitably makes plea in behalf of the saving Passion and shews that the Death on the Cross was not of human necessity, nor did Jesus suffer death against His will from the tyranny of another, but rather did offer Himself for us a spotless Sacrifice to God the Father by reason of His inherent love for us. For since He must needs suffer (since thus would the imported corruption and sin and death be overturned), He hath given Himself a Ransom for the life of all. What then will be found in the words before us making for<i> </i>the saving Passion, and what of profit the aim of the thoughts therein is replete with, do thou again hear.<i><sup><font size="3"> </font></sup></i>For Christ (he says) was speaking <i>these words </i>not outside of Jerusalem, nor in any city of those round about, nor yet in a more insignificant town or village of Judaea, for He was standing by the very <i>treasury, </i>i. e., in the midst of the very courts in the Temple itself was He making His Discourse on these matters. But the Pharisees, albeit deeply cut to the heart and grieved exceedingly at what was said by Him, <i>laid </i>not <i>hands upon Him, </i>when it was in their power most easily to do this; for He was, as I said, within the meshes. What then was it that persuaded to be quiet even against their will, those who are raging like fierce beasts? what was it that checked their anger? how was the bloodthirsty heart of the Pharisees charmed? <i>Not yet, </i>he says, <i>had His hour come, </i>that is, not yet was the time of His Death at hand, <a name="p578"><span><font color="#000000">|578</font></span></a> by no other hand marked out for the Saviour Christ, nor yet cast upon Him by fate (as the lying fables of the Greeks say) or by the hour (after their babbling speech), but rather marked out by Him according to the good pleasure of God the Father. For being God by Nature and Very and unknowing to miss of what was fit, full well did He know how long time it was right to live in Flesh with those on the earth, and when again to depart to heaven, having destroyed death by the death of His own Flesh. For that not by the tyranny of any, was death brought upon Him That is by Nature Life, is I suppose clear to all who are wise: for how should the bonds of death prevail over the Life by Nature? and the Lord Himself somewhere testifieth saying, <i>No man taketh </i>My life <i>from Me, </i>I <i>lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and again I have power to take it. </i>For if the time in which He must surely suffer death, were laid down as of necessity by some other, how should we find it in His own power to <i>lay down </i>that <i>Life? </i>for it would have been taken even against His will, if His Passion were not in His own power. But if He <i>lays it down of </i>Himself, we shall see the Passion to be not in the Power of any other but in His own Will. For then did He permit to Jewish folly to go through to its own end, when He saw that the fit time for His Death had now come.</p><p>Let not then the haughty Pharisee brag of his own daring deeds, nor puffed up with exceeding ill-counsel say, If Christ were by Nature God, how came He not to be without my meshes? how escaped He not my hands? for he will hear in reply from those who love Him, Not thy meshes, O sir, prevailed, for it were nought hard for God supreme over all to crush thy snare, and pass forth of the net of thy impiety: but the Suffering was the salvation of the world, the Passion the undoing of death, the Mighty Cross the overthrow of sin and corruption. This He knowing as God, submitted Himself to thy unholy daring. For what, tell me, was the hindrance to thy enfolding Him <i>then </i>especially when thou wert gnashing thy teeth at Him, as He was <i>teaching </i>by the very <i>treasury? </i>and if it was the work of thy might to <a name="p579"><span><font color="#000000">|579</font></span></a> overcome Christ, why didst thou not make Him a prisoner then? But thou stoodst in anger unmitigated to bloodshed all revealed, yet doing nought of the things thou wouldest. For not yet did He will to suffer, Who was persuaded by thy mad folly, as by bits which may not be snapped. These things may one with reason opposing to the vain talk of the Jews, shame them even against their will, into not bragging of what they least ought. And one may well admire the holy Evangelist reasonably shewing, and clearly saying that the Saviour was <i>teaching these things in the temple </i>by <i>the Treasury and no man laid hands on Him: </i>for he was witnessing so to speak to Christ's own words, which He said to the Jews when they were at hand to take Him, <i>As against' a robber are ye come out with swords and staves for to take Me? daily did I sit teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on Me. </i>And one would not (I suppose) say, if one thought rationally, that He was blaming the Jews, that they had not brought on His Passion untimely, nor yet that letting slip the right time, they were advancing too slowly to shed blood: but rather He is convicting them, as unwisely supposing that they should have prevailed even against His will, and could have seized by force Him who may not suffer except He will. For <i>I was sitting teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on Me, </i>for then I willed it not, nor would ye now avail to do this, except I willingly subjected Myself to your hands. Hence one may on all sides see, that no work was it of Jewish might to put our Lord to death; but to their unholy daring may one attribute the attempt, to our Saviour Christ the will to suffer for all, that He might free all and, having bought them with His own Blood, present them to God the Father. For <i>God, </i>as Paul saith, <i>was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, </i>and in all forgiveness restoring that which had fallen away from friendship with Him, unto what it was in the beginning.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>21    <i>He said therefore unto them again, </i>I <i>go My way, and ye shall seek Me and shall die in your sins.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>That we must needs take hold of the present time for whatever one may receive profit from to oneself, does Christ <a name="p580"><span><font color="#000000">|580</font></span></a> herein well declare unto us. For to be too late in what is good and to take after-counsel for what is profitable, clearly brings no gain but ministers wailing befitting the neglect. Our Lord therefore being <i>good </i>and gracious, as it is written, both bears with those who dishonour Him and aids those who insult Him and is found as God superior to all the littleness of man. Yet does He for their good threaten to depart from them, and says plainly <i>I go My way, </i>that He may implant in them a more resolved mind, and that they considering that they ought not to leave their Redeemer when present frustrate of His work, He may whet them to pass on to the faith and may make them now at length more ready unto obedience. And having cried out, <i>I go My way, </i>and threatened departure from the whole nation, He subjoined economically the damage therefrom ensuing unto them. For (He says) <i>Ye shall die in your sins; </i>and we shall see the nature of the thing bringing in the truth of what is said. For they who did not at all receive Him Who came to us from Heaven that He might justify all through faith, how shall they not beyond all contradiction <i>die in </i>their <i>sins, </i>and not receiving Him Who can cleanse them, how will they not have lasting defilement from their impiety? For to die unredeemed, yet laden with the weight of sin, to whom is it any doubt where this will conduct the soul of man? For deep Hades will, I deem, receive such an one, and he will continue in great darkness, yea he will inhabit fire and flames, with reason numbered among those of whom it has been said by Prophet's voice, <i>Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be for a sight to all flesh. </i>Whereof that they may escape the trial, Christ kept manifoldly calling them to a speedy turning away from their wonted unbelief, saying not only that He should leave them and go away, but also of necessity putting before them how great misfortune they will thence undergo. For <i>ye shall die </i>(He says) <i>in your sins. </i>But since He put in between, <i>And ye shall seek Me, </i>and hitherto we do not find the Jews seeking Him, we shall reasonably go to some other <a name="p581"><span><font color="#000000">|581</font></span></a> meaning: for He must needs be True. For even though they now in the body and yet in full enjoyment of the pleasures of the flesh, for their exceeding senselessness seek not their Redeemer, yet when they wretched fall into hell and have their abode in the place of punishments, when they are in the ill itself, then, then will they <i>seek </i>even against their will. For <i>there </i>(He says) is <i>weeping and gnashing of teeth, </i>each (it is likely) of those there wailing his carelessness in what was good, and well-nigh saying what is in the Book of Proverbs, <i>I have not obeyed the voice of him that instructed me and taught me. </i>Therefore as Paul saith, <i>Let us therefore fear lest, a promise being left </i>us <i>of entering into His Rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. </i>For we must <i>run, that </i>we <i>may obtain, </i>and not by our disbelief insult Him Who draws us out of bitter bondage, but submit ourselves and with upturned hands lay hold on the grace.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>and whither </i>I <i>go, </i>YE <i>cannot come.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Not only does He say that they <i>shall die in their sins, </i>but declares clearly that, ascending not to the mansions above, they will remain outside of the good things of the kingdom: for they who received not Him Who came from above, how could they also follow Him ascending up? Double therefore is the punishment to them who believe not, and not in any single thing their loss. For just as they who have fallen into bodily loss of health must needs suffer and endure the trials of the suffering and besides be deprived of the pleasures of health; so and not otherwise do they who have departed into Hades, and there undergo punishment proportionate to the sins, both endure the state of punishment and lose the enjoyment of the hope of the saints. Most excellently then does our Lord Jesus Christ say not only that they <i>shall die in </i>their <i>sins, </i>but also that they shall not mount up to the mansions above: for binding them as by a twofold cord, does He haste to draw them away from their inherent ill-counsel. From all sides saving that which was lost and binding up the broken and raising up that which <a name="p582"><span><font color="#000000">|582</font></span></a> was broken down (for these are the ways of a Good Shepherd and One Who readily gives His Life for the salvation of the sheep) does He tell His own disciples, I <i>will go and prepare a place for you, and will come again and receive you with Myself, </i>shewing that the very heaven will be accessible to the saints and teaching that the mansions above have been prepared for them that love Him, but to those who have chosen to disbelieve Him, rightly and needs does He say, <i>Whither </i>I <i>go</i> YE <i>cannot come. </i>For who at all will follow the All-holy Christ, if he love not the cleansing that is through faith? or how shall he that is yet defiled and that has not cleared off the filth from his passions be with our Lord Who loves us? <i>What communion hath light with darkness, </i>as Paul saith? For I deem that they ought to be holy who would say to the All-Pure God, <i>My soul cleaveth after Thee.</i></p><p>I think that this meaning has now too not amiss been put on the words before us, but if one must go about and view it differently, and say yet something else besides, we will not shrink from doing this too. <i>Whither </i>I <i>go, </i>YE <i>cannot come. </i>Being Very God, I am absent from no one, I fill all things, and being with all, I dwell specially in Heaven, gladly having abode with holy spirits. But since I am the human-loving Framer of all things, I deemed intolerable the loss of My creation, I beheld man going away to utter destruction, I viewed him falling from sin unto death, I must needs reach forth an helping Hand to him as he lay, I must needs in every way aid him overcome and falling. How then was it meet to save that which was lost? it needed that the Physician should be with those in peril, it needed that Life should be there present with the dying, it needed that Light should have its abode with those in darkness. But it were not possible that ye being men by nature should take wing to Heaven and have your abode with the Saviour. Therefore have <i>I </i>Myself come to you, I heard the Saints oftentimes crying aloud, <i>Bow Thy Heavens o Lord and come down; </i>I bowed the Heavens therefore and have come down; for in no other way <a name="p583"><span><font color="#000000">|583</font></span></a> could ye look to come hither. Yet do I endure to remain with you, do ye more resolutely lay hold of life, purify yourselves through faith while He is with you Who knows to, and can, compassionate with authority. For I shall go, yea shall return again whither YE <i>cannot come</i>; even though ye should seek the Giver of salvation by an untimely after-counsel, ye shall not find Him: what follows ye may see. For <i>ye shall </i>surely <i>die in your sins, </i>and weighed down by your own transgressions, shall go mourning to the prison-house of death, there to pay the penalty of your lengthened unbelief. The Saviour then being good and exceeding loving to man, compels the Jews by fears of future punishment even against their will to be saved.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>23    <i>And He said unto them, </i>YE <i>are from beneath, </i>I <i>am from above.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Some one haply of those who have a more studious mind and are wont to approve the more subtle of the Divine Thoughts, will enquire what it was that induced our Lord Jesus Christ, Who but now addressed the Jews and said, I <i>go My way, and ye shall seek Me, </i>to add as something necessary, YE <i>are from beneath, </i>I <i>am from above. </i>For these words seem somehow not to harmonise altogether with those above, but they are replete with a hidden economy. For since He is God, having no need as the Divine Evangelist John himself somewhere says, <i>that any one should testify of man, for He knew what was in man, </i>for He penetrateth <i>even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and conceptions of the heart</i>: He is not ignorant of the unlearned fantasies of the Jews, who, since a gross and feeble mind was their inmate, when they heard from the Saviour's Lips, <i>I go My way, </i>foolishly thought either that leaving Judaea He would flee somewhere or that He is saying somewhat of this kind, While I live and survive believe, lest death should befall me. For, I go My way, taken in its common meaning signifies this too. And it is no wonder if the Jews have fallen into such uncounsel as even to imagine something <a name="p584"><span><font color="#000000">|584</font></span></a> of this kind as to Christ. For they knew not that He is God by Nature, but looking only to this body which is of the earth, they imagined that He was a man as one of us. Therefore does the Saviour blaming them say, YE <i>judge after the flesh. </i>Removing them therefore from so puerile and grovelling a notion, He again teaches them that not of any one subject to birth and decay are they reasoning such things, but of Him Who is in truth begotten from above and from God the Father. Not to Me therefore (He says) will belong death and flight, for <i>I am from above, </i>i. e., God from God (for God is above all) but you will this rather befit. For <i>from, beneath are ye, </i>that is of nature subject to death and falling under decay and dread. Of Me therefore (He says) do ye letting go your own weakness imagine nought of this sort, for not of equal honour with the Lord is the bond, with Him Who is from above and begotten of God the Father that which is <i>from beneath </i>and of the earth.</p><p>But that <i>from above </i>signifies the Eternal Generation of the Son from God the Father, wise reasoning will persuade us to hold. For <i>from above </i>understood of place signifies the being from Heaven, but nought would be in the Son special above the creature that is below and subject to God, if He come only from Heaven, since the more part of the angels too <i>sent forth to minister </i>walk below, ordering some of the affairs on the earth, descending from above and from Heaven. And the Saviour is a witness to us saying, <i>Verily verily I say unto you, ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man. </i>Since then angels too descend from above, from heaven, why vainly does Christ boast as of something great and surpassing the whole creation, in having come I mean <i>from above? </i>But one may without the smallest toil and trouble see Who is by Nature the Only-Begotten, what the angels that are from Him. Needs therefore does <i>from above </i>signify to us not this From Heaven which is common [to Him and the Angels] but that the Son beamed forth<i> </i>from the Nature Which is most exalted and above all things. Therefore doth <i>from above </i>in regard to the Only-Begotten Alone, <a name="p585"><span><font color="#000000">|585</font></span></a> signify the being from God and nought else. For while all things are said to be and to exist from God, the Son has this special above all, viz., to be of the Very Essence of the Father by Generation and not as creatures by creation. <a name="p586"><span><font color="#000000">|586</font></span></a> </p><blockquote><p><b>CHAPTER <span><a name="C4"></a>IV.</span> That the Son is by Nature God, wholly remote from likeness to the creature, as regards Essence.</b></p><blockquote><p>YE <i>are of this world, </i>I <i>am not of this world.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He shewed herein and very clearly what is the meaning of <i>Above, </i>what of <i>Beneath. </i>For since it was like that the Pharisees able to understand nothing would consider what had been said in a more corporal manner, and understand the <i>Above </i>and <i>Beneath </i>of place and would thence stray into many notions, profitably did our Lord Jesus Christ bare His word of the obscurity that seemed to have been cast upon it and from all want of clearness, putting more clearly in the sequel what He had said darkly. For YE (He says) <i>are of this world, i. </i>e., from beneath, I <i>am not of this world, </i>this then is From above. For God overpasses all that is created, not having superiority in local exaltation (for it were foolish and utterly uninstructed to conceive of the Incorporeal as local) but surpassing things originate by the ineffable Excellences of Nature. Of this Essence does the Word say that He is, not the creation, but the Fruit and Offspring. For observe how He says not, From above have I been created and made, but rather, <i>I am, </i>that He may shew both whence He is and that He was ever Eternally with His own Progenitor. For He is as the Father too is: but He That is and is Eternally with Him That is, how He was not, let the folly of them who think otherwise <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#15" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">15</font></u></sup></a> say.</p><p>But haply the foe of the Truth will withstand us saying, "Not without qualification hath Christ said, <i>I am not of the world, </i>but by adding <i>This, </i>He hath shewn accurately <a name="p587"><span><font color="#000000">|587</font></span></a> that there is another world, the spiritual, whence He might be."</p><p>Therefore among creatures is the Son (for this is what thy language, O sir, is working out for us), among those who have originate nature will the Creator be surely classed, putting about Him some angelic perchance and slave-befitting dignity you deem that yourself will escape the charge of blasphemy. For do you not know, that though you attribute to Him that highest position and status which the holy angels will be conceived of as having, though you confess that He is above every Princedom and Authority and Throne, and yet believe Him to be originate, you sin against Him no whit the less? For there is no worthy place whatever of superiority over the rest to the Only-Begotten, so long as He is at all conceived of as created. For not in having precedence of any hath He glory but in being not originate, yea rather God of God by Nature. But THOU again art classing Him Who beamed forth from God and therefore is God, with things originate, and thou reckonest Him to be a part of the world, and if not perchance of this one yet of another (for imagined distinction of worlds will make no difference at all, in respect of having been made): and dost thou not blush putting the Word Who sitteth with Him Who begat Him, in the category of His guards and those who stand before Him? for dost thou not hear Gabriel saying to Zacharias, I <i>am Gabriel that stand in the Presence of God and I was sent to speak unto thee, </i>and Isaiah, <i>I saw the Lord of Sabaoth sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and the Seraphim were standing round about Him. </i>And (marvel!) the Prophet was beholding the Son and called Him Lord of Sabaoth, and introduces Him as King with the highest Powers as Body-guard. And that it really was the Glory of the Only-Begotten which he was beholding, the wise John will testify saying, <i>These things said Esaias because </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#16" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">16</font></u></sup></a> <i>he saw His glory: and of Him spake he. </i>Wherefore the Divine Paul too, both from His Co-sitting with God the Father and <a name="p588"><span><font color="#000000">|588</font></span></a> from His being called Son by Nature, coming to most accurate perception of the Mystery and gathering the knowledge pertaining to the idea,<i> </i>says, <i>For unto which of the Angels said </i>(i. e., God the Father) <i>at any time, My Son art </i>THOU, <i>this day have </i>I <i>begotten Thee? </i>(for in the word <i>I have begotten, </i>He shews that the Son is by Nature God of God) and again, <i>But to which of the Angels said He at any time, Sit on My Right Hand? </i>And he does not in saying this accuse God the Father of either being wont to do aught unjust or as dishonouring the nature of the angels, when He honoured that by a position below the Son. For what hinders (may one say) since God the Father is just and good, His making the nature too of the angels assessor with Himself, if the Son be altogether among things originate, and con-natural with them in respect of having been created, even though by some other excellences He surpass the measure belonging to them, just as they may surpass us. But not unrighteous is God the Father, who bade the Angels to stand in the Presence, and gave this Dignity to their nature, having His own Son co-seated with Himself, since He knows that He is by Nature God, and that His own Offspring is not alien from His Essence. How then is He any longer originate, how <i>of </i>an originate <i>world </i>and not rather in the same [state] wherein is Very God, i. e., above all things that are conceived of and acknowledged to exist in every world?</p><p>But since ye put out as something great and resistless Christ saying with some fair distinction, I <i>am not of this world</i>; and by the word <i>this, </i>ye affirm that the other world is meant, saying that He is of it, let us see again if ye are not staying yourselves upon rotten arguments, prompted to reason and think thus by only your own want of thought. For the word <i>This, </i>or <i>of this </i>(as it may be), or whatever we say pronomically, is demonstrative, and not altogether or necessarily indicative of <i>another. </i>And verily the blessed Baruch, pointing out to us the One and only God, says, <i>This is our God, there shall none other be accounted of in comparison with Him, </i>but if the word <i>This </i>were altogether significant of another, how would not another be accounted of in <a name="p589"><span><font color="#000000">|589</font></span></a> comparison of Him? yea and the righteous Symeon too, prophesying the mystery of Christ, says, <i>Behold this </i>child <i>is set for the fall and rising again of many </i>dead <i>in Israel and for a sign which is spoken against, </i>although unto whom is it not most manifest, that not as severing us from other persons does the righteous man say, This, but intimating that He Who is now present and has been set for this, is by Himself? Therefore when Christ says, I <i>am not of this world, </i>not surely as being of another world does He say it, but as defining and laying down in a more corporeal form, as if two places, the originate nature I mean and that of the Man Who is Ineffable and above every essence, He puts the Jews in the place of things originate, saying, YE <i>are of this world, </i>Himself He altogether severing from things created, and connecting with the other place, I mean Godhead, says, <i>I am not of this world. </i>Hence contrasting (for our knowledge) the Godhead with the world, He gives <i>Of this </i>to the latter, Himself He apportions to God Who hath begotten Him and to the Essence which is Supreme over all.</p><p>"But"<i> </i>(says he) "God the Father will in nothing wrong the nature of the angels, if He do not please to honour it in the same degree as the Son. For variety in the creation, or the apportioning glory in befitting degree to each, in no wise argues that God is unjust, since how then should WE be less than the angels, albeit we confess that God is Righteous? What then we are in respect of the angels, that are the angels too in respect of the Son<i>; </i>for they yield as to one better than they, the being in greater honour than themselves be."</p><p>But, most excellent sir, shall we reply, shaming the unlearned heretic, if even though we be remote from the glory of the angels, since we come short of the piety too that is inherent in them and though there be much variety in the creation and diversity, and superiority in honour or inferiority according to the will of Him Who made them, yet is the being created common to all, and in this there is nought at all that surpasseth or cometh short of other. For that an angel should excel a man in honour and glory is nought <a name="p590"><span><font color="#000000">|590</font></span></a> wonderful, or an archangel too an angel; but the power of mounting up to the glory of Him Who made all things, we shall find to accrue to no one of creatures: for not any of the things that have been made will be God, nor will the bond be equal in honour with the Lord, co-sitting with Him and co-reigning. What measure then of honour will there be to the Son? being according to you originate and of the spiritual world, will He have God-befitting Dignity? how will that which is connatural with the creation mount up to the same glory as He Who is by Nature God, albeit God saith, <i>My Glory will I not give to another? </i>what (tell me) put the devil forth of the heavenly halls? was it the thirsting for honour which beseemed the originate nature, yet better and greater than the measure which accrued to him, and was it in this that the nature of his crimes lay? or was it that he dared to say, <i>I will be like the Most High? </i>For the creature pictured to itself that it could mount up to the Nature of its Maker and be co-throned with God Who has the power over all. Wherefore he hath also fallen <i>as lightning, </i>as it is written, <i>from heaven. </i>But THOU springing heedlessly upon things so insecure, accountst it nothing that the Son being according to you of some world, and consequently parcel of the creation, should be called by way of honour by God the Father to sit with Him, though Essence in no wise bestow upon Him this nor call Him to Dignity befitting and due to it. For He receives, if it be as YE in your babbling say, things above the creature in the way of favour. Away with such blasphemy, man, for we will not be thus minded, may God avert it! For we believe that angels and archangels and those in yet higher place than they, are diversely honoured by the Authority and Counsel of the All-wise God, Who allots to each of the things that are a just Decree: but as to the Son by Nature, we will not imagine that He is so, for no glory by way of favour and imported hath He, but since He is of the Essence of God the Father, Very God of God by Nature and Very, He is co-throned and co-seated with Him, having all things under His Feet as God, and of the Father with the <a name="p591"><span><font color="#000000">|591</font></span></a> Father in God-befitting way aloft above the whole creation. Wherefore rightly heareth He, <i>For all things </i>are <i>Thy servants. </i>And since from all sides He is found to be Very God, it is (I suppose) wholly clear that He is <i>not of this world, </i>i. e., originate. For the <i>world </i>here signifies to us the nature of created things, carrying the comparison from a part unto the whole that is conceived of as created. As then God withdrawing Himself from all connaturalness with the creature said in the Prophets, <i>For </i>I <i>am God and not man </i>(and not because He said that He is not man as we, shall we surely therefore class Him with angels or any other of things originate, but from part going unto the whole, will confess that God is by Nature Other than all things originate), so I deem that we ought piously to understand the hard things that come in our way; <i>for we see in a mirror by a figure, </i>as Paul saith.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>24   <i>I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having by few words overturned the most ill-counselled fantasy of those who thus conceived, and convicted them again of talking nonsense about Himself, He returns so to speak to the original aim of His Speech, and resuming it again He shews them in how great ill they will be and into what they will fall, if they most unreasonably repulse any believing on Him. A thing very befitting a wise and grave master is this too: for I think that a teacher ought not to quarrel with the ignorance of his hearers nor to be slack in, his care for them, even if perchance they do not very readily take in the knowledge of the lessons, but anew, yea many times, to return to the same things and go through the same words (since verily the enduring ploughman cleaving the field and having exhausted no slight toil thereon, when he has sown the seed in the furrows, if he see any spoilt, he turns again to the plough, and grudges not to sow upon the now ruined parts): for having missed his aim the first time he will not altogether do the same the second. A like habit the Divine Paul too practising somewhere says, <i>To</i> <a name="p592"><span><font color="#000000">|592</font></span></a> <i>say</i> <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#17" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">17</font></u></sup></a> <i>the same things to you to me indeed </i>is <i>not grievous, but for you </i>it is <i>safe. </i>Seest thou that as the teacher is found superior to sloth, then to the hearers often follows the being in safe practice? Serviceably then does our Lord Jesus Christ repeating His Discourse with the Jews affirm that the penalty of not believing on Him will be in no passing things: for He says that they who believe not must surely die in their sins. And that death in transgressions is an heavy burden, because it will deliver the soul of man unto the all-devouring flame, none may doubt.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>For if ye believe not that </i>I <i>am, ye shall die in your sins.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He explains more exactly what will happen, and having made the mode of salvation most evident, He shews again by what way they going shall mount up to the life of the saints, and shall attain to the city that is above, the heavenly Jerusalem. And not only does He say that one ought to believe but affirms that it must needs be on Him. For we are justified by believing on Him as on God from God, as on the Saviour and Redeemer and King of all and Lord in truth. Therefore He says, Ye shall perish <i>if ye believe not that </i>I <i>am. </i>But the <i>I </i>(He says) is He of Whom it is written in the Prophets, <i>Shine shine o Jerusalem for thy Light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. </i>For <i>I </i>(saith He) <i>am </i>He Who of old bade go to the putting off of the diseases of the soul and Who promised the healing of love through saying, <i>Return ye returning children and I will heal your backslidings. I am </i>He Who declared that the God-befitting and olden goodness and incomparable forbearance should be poured on you, and therefore cried aloud, I, I <i>am He That blotteth out thy sins and I will not remember. </i>I <i>am </i>(He says) He Who by the Prophet Isaiah also said, <i>Wash you, make you clean, put away your wickednesses from your hearts from before Mine Eyes, cease from your wickednesses, and come and let us reason together saith the Lord, even though your sins be as scarlet, I</i> <a name="p593"><span><font color="#000000">|593</font></span></a> <i>will whiten them as snow, even though they be like crimson, I will whiten them as wool. I </i>(says He) <i>am </i>He concerning whom again Isaiah the Prophet himself says, <i>O Zion that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain, o Jerusalem that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength, lift ye up, be not afraid; behold your God, behold the Lord cometh with strength and His Arm with rule, behold His reward with Him and His work before Him: like a shepherd shall He feed His flock, He shall gather the lambs with His Arm and shall comfort those that are with young: </i>and again, <i>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers be clear. I am </i>(He saith) He of Whom again it is written that <i>suddenly shall come to His Temple the Lord Whom </i>YE <i>are seeking, even the Messenger of the covenant Whom </i>YE <i>are desiring, behold He cometh, saith the Lord of hosts, and who shall abide the Day of His Coming? or who shall stand in His Sight? for He shall enter in as fire in a smelting house and as the sope of fullers. I am </i>(He saith) He Who for the salvation of all men promised to offer Myself for a Sacrifice to God the Father through the voice of the Psalmist and cried, <i>Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldst not, a Body preparedst Thou Me; whole burnt offerings and for sin Thou delightedst not in, then I said, Lo I come, in the chapter of the Book it is written of Me, to do Thy Will, O God. </i>I <i>am, </i>He saith, and the very law through Moses did preach Me, saying thus, <i>A Prophet of thy brethren like unto me will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, unto Him shall ye hearken; according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly.</i></p><p>Therefore with reason (says He) shall ye perish and shall pay to the Judge most righteous Doom, for your much unholiness of manners not giving heed to Him Who through many saints was fore-heralded to you, and attested by the things too which I work. For verily and in truth no argument will liberate from the obligation of undergoing punishment those who believe not on Him, seeing that the <a name="p594"><span><font color="#000000">|594</font></span></a> Divinely-inspired Scripture is filled with testimonies and words regarding Him and Himself affords by His Works Splendour conformable to what was long ago prophesied of Him.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>25    <i>They said therefore to Him, Who art </i>THOU?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Their word commingled with fiercest anger proceeds from boastfulness. For they eagerly ask, not to learn and believe, but out of much madness they spring (so to speak) on Christ. For He says in more simple word, I <i>am, </i>not adding, God of God, nor yet ought else to indicate His inherent Glory; but in lowly wise and apart from all boasting He says only this I <i>am, </i>leaving it to the better instructed to add what was wanting; and they go on to wildest and unbridled madness, and from unmeasured haughtiness they all but cut short the Saviour's word not yet advanced to its completion, and so to say rebuke and interrupt Him in the middle and say, <i>Who art </i>THOU? This is the part of one who openly says, Dost Thou dare to think of Thyself ought greater than WE know? we know that Thou art son of the carpenter, a man low and most poor, of no note with us and altogether nought. They therefore condemn the Lord as being nought, looking only to His family after the flesh, but the Magnificence that pertains to His works, and still more His Generation from above and from the Father, whence they might specially recognize that He is by Nature God, they do not so much as admit into their mind. For who will work the things that befit God Alone? will not He surely Who is by Nature God? but Christ wrought them; He therefore was and is God, even when made Flesh for the salvation and life of all. But they whose belief is confined to their own mis-counsels, and take no account at all of our Divine and Divinely-inspired Scripture<i>; </i>they in regard of the very things for which they ought to give thanks, do disparage Him, knowing <i>neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. </i></p><p>Punctuating therefore with emphasis at the word THOU, and throwing back what is called the acute accent, we take the word as a question with note of admiration; for they <a name="p595"><span><font color="#000000">|595</font></span></a> say THOU, as though, Thou Who art nothing at all, and art known by us to be so, Thou Who art mean and of mean extraction, what canst Thou say illustrious of Thyself, what worth speaking of those about Thee? For nought of such daring is foreign to Jewish madness.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Jesus said unto them, That I speak to you at the beginning.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I am dishonoured (He says) albeit I invite unto everlasting life, unto forgiveness of sins, unto putting off of death and corruption, unto holiness, unto righteousness, unto glory, unto boasting in the sonship with God: yea I Who would crown you with all these, am counted for nought, and esteemed by you thus worthless, yea verily I am in deserved condition (He says) because I made a <i>beginning </i>of discourse with you, because I have spoken somewhat that could profit you, and devised to save those who were on the point of descending to such deep depravity as to aim at repaying bitter requital to Him Who hath elected to save them.</p><p>Something else besides does Christ appear to indicate to us hereby. It was right (He says) that I should not converse at all with you <i>at the beginning </i>but on them rather should confer this who shall most gladly rejoice in My words and without delay submit their neck to the Gospel ordinances. He means by these the multitude of the Gentiles. But while we conceive of Him as saying thus, we will guard against the words of the adversaries. For one of those who are wont to fight against Christ will haply say, "If the Son ought not to address the Jews at the beginning, but rather the Gentiles, He missed of what was fit, by doing this rather than that." But we will reply, Not as repenting of His own or of the Father's Will, does the Son say thus, nor yet as having transgressed what befitted the Economy (for God would not have devised ought which did not altogether beseem to be): but by saying that not to you was it right to speak at the beginning, nor among you to lay a foundation of saving teaching, He shews that both the Father and Himself are by Nature True and Loving to man.    For lo He freely gave <a name="p596"><span><font color="#000000">|596</font></span></a> to the unholy Jews though not worthy of it the saving word, having put in the second place the multitude of the Gentiles albeit more readily making it their aim both to believe and obey Him. </p><p>What was it then which persuaded Him to prefer and fore-honour before the rest the stiffnecked people of the Jews? To them He made through the holy Prophets the promise of His Coming, to them was the grace due for the fathers' sake. Wherefore He also said, <i>I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, </i>and to the Syro-phenician woman, <i>It is not meet to take, the children's bread and to cast </i>it <i>to the dogs. </i>Therefore has Israel been honoured and ranked before the Gentiles, although he had the crookeder disposition. But since he knew not the Lord of all and the Perfecter of the promised good things, the grace of the teaching departed at last to the Gentiles, whom it behoved the Lord at <i>the beginning </i>and first to have addressed, not in regard of the promise made to the fathers, but in regard of their innate obedience.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>26 <i>I have many things to say and to judge of you.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Seeing that the Jews condemn Him more recklessly, and though they have nothing at all to accuse Him of, are haughty on account only of the poorness of His Birth after the Flesh, and therefore say that He is nought, He shamed them mildly, having said above more openly, YE <i>judge after the flesh, </i>I <i>judge no man. </i>But judging after the flesh will reasonably have some such meaning as this: They who delight only in earthly things, see nought of the heavenly good things, but looking only to illustriousness in this life, admire the wealthy or him who boasts in some other petty glories. But they who after the law of God examine thoroughly<i> </i>into the nature of things say that he is really the man worthy of love and admiration, who has within him the desire to live according to the counsel and will of Him Who hath made him. For low position after the flesh will nothing harm the soul of the man who is accustomed to do well, and on the other hand illustrious portion in this life and <a name="p597"><span><font color="#000000">|597</font></span></a> the splendour of wealth will nothing profit those who refuse to live aright. They therefore <i>judge after the flesh, </i>as we said just now, who look not to holiness, who use not to prove their walk, their manners, but turn aside their mind to only earthly things and deem worthy of all admiration him that is brought up in wealth and luxury. YE then, O most unwise rulers of the Jews, albeit by the Law of Moses instructed unto accuracy of giving judgment, judging upon no grounds at all, condemn for only bodily low estate Him Who through many wondrous works is shewn to you to be God. But <i>I </i>will not imitate your ill-instructedness, nor will I pass such kind of judgment on you: for nothing at all is human nature. For what is this perishable and earthly body? rottenness and the worm and nought else. Yet I will not for this reason condemn you, nor because ye are men by nature, will I therefore decide that ye ought wholly to be spurned: <i>I have many things to say and to judge of you, </i>that is, every accusing word has a full office to you-ward, not of one thing alone shall I accuse you, but of many, and in none shall I speak falsely as do YE, <i>I have to judge </i>you as disbelieving, as braggarts, as insulters, as fighters against God, as without feeling, as unthankful, as wicked, as lovers of pleasure rather than habitually loving God, as receiving <i>honour one of another and </i>seeking <i>not the honour that </i>cometh <i>from the Only </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#18" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">18</font></u></sup></a>, as setting on fire the spiritual vineyard, as not feeding aright the flock entrusted to you by God, as not leading them by the hand unto Him That is proclaimed by the Law and the Prophets, i. e., Me. Such things will the Saviour be declaring to the Jews, but by adding, <i>I have </i>yet <i>many things to say and to judge of you, </i>He threatens them that He will one Day appear as their Judge, Who seemed to them to be nought by reason of the Flesh.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>But He That sent Me is True, and </i>I <i>the things which I heard from Him, these speak I unto the world.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having taken leave of the Jews' ill-instructedness, and <a name="p598"><span><font color="#000000">|598</font></span></a> reckoned as nought those who dared without restraint to revile Him, He returns again to what He was saying at the beginning, reserving the judging them and that in all freedom for not this present but for the fitting time, and retaining to the time of the Appearance its proper aim (for He <i>came not to judge the world but to save the world, </i>as Himself says). Wherefore keeping fast hold of the things befitting Him, and repeating the word that calls unto salvation, He carries on His exhortation. For herein was it meet that we should both marvel at the measure of His Forbearance and the exceedingness of His inherent Love for man: wherefore doth Peter too write of Him, <i>Who when He was reviled, reviled not again, when He suffered, He threatened not but committed </i>Himself <i>to Him That judgeth righteously. </i>Therefore will I expend (He says) discourse upon you now in particular, not for what ye are wont to do it, for faultfinding I mean and exercise unto nought that is profitable: but having reserved the judging you for its fit time, I will keep to what is for your good, and will not cease from care of you, even though ye of your innate madness foolishly insult Me. I said therefore to you just now, I <i>am the Light of the world, he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; </i>at this ye unreasonably vexed sprang sharply upon Me saying, THOU <i>bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not true</i>; to this again I, <i>Even though </i>I <i>bear record of Myself My record is true, for I know whence I came and whither I go. </i>But if I seem to be burdensome to you saying these things to you, if I be not a reliable witness of the Dignities accruing to Me by Nature, yet <i>He That sent Me is True and the things which I heard of Him, these speak I unto the world. </i>I speak the same (He says) as the Father Who sent Me, I utter words conformable to His, in saying that I am by Nature Light. The <i>things </i>then which <i>I heard </i>God the Father say of Me, <i>these things I speak to the world. </i>If then I speak false according to you, and My <i>record is not true, </i>ye must certainly needs say that the Father spake falsely before Me.    But He <i>is True:  </i>therefore I do not  speak <a name="p599"><span><font color="#000000">|599</font></span></a> falsely, and if ye do not believe My Words, reverence (He says) the Voice of Him That sent Me. For what said He of Me? <i>Behold a Man, The Day-spring</i> <i>His Name, </i>and again to those who reverence Him, <i>And unto you that fear My Name shall the Sun of righteousness arise and healing in His wings; </i>and to Me Whom ye unknowing insult, He says, <i>Behold I have given Thee for a Covenant of the people </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#19" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">19</font></u></sup></a><i> for a light of the nations. </i>But that I am also a Light was told you by Him, for He says, <i>Shine shine O Jerusalem for thy Light is come and the glory of the Lord hath risen upon thee. </i>These things did I hear the Father Who <i>sent Me </i>say of Me, and therefore do I say that <i>I am the Light of the world, </i>but YE disparaged Me, because of the Flesh only judging not rightly, and therefore are ye bold to say frequently, THOU <i>bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not true.</i></p><p>Therefore (for it is meet to sum up the whole mind of what is before us) He shews that the Jews are fighting right against God, and that not only with His words, but also with the Father's decree. For He knows that His Son is by Nature Light and calls Him therefore Dayspring and San of Righteousness, but they pulling down the destruction of unbelief upon their own heads reject the Truth calling <i>good evil </i>and therefore shall rightly the <i>Woe </i>follow them.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>27 <i>They knew not that He spake to them of the Father.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The Spirit-clad is astonishment-stricken at the senselessness of the Jews, and with great reason: for what more without understanding than such, who, when much discourse and often had been made to them concerning God the Father, conceive not of Him a whit when they hear our Saviour saying, <i>But He That sent Me is True? </i>What then is the plea, and why the blessed Evangelist says that the Jews knew not that Christ in these words signified God <i>the Father </i>to them, we must needs say.    For since the Saviour said to <a name="p600"><span><font color="#000000">|600</font></span></a> them, <i>If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also, </i>in order that in this too He may be found saying what was true, the Evangelist brings in those who know not the Son, as ignorant of the Father too. For the Son is (so to speak) a Door and Gate unto the knowledge of the Father, wherefore He also said, <i>No man cometh unto the Father but by Me. </i>For the mind darting up from Image to Archetype imageth the other from what is before it. It was necessary therefore to shew that the Jews had no conception of the Father, since they would not be led, upward mounting from knowledge of the Son to conception of the Father. Wherefore does the Evangelist clearly shew that when Christ says, <i>He That sent Me is True, they knew not that He spake to them of the Father.</i></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>28    <i>When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that </i>I <i>am.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Imitating the most excellent physicians, He lays bare the cause of their soul's infirmity and clearly opens what it was that hinders their going with resolution to understanding and faith towards Him. For since looking at the Flesh and its family, they were induced to think slightingly of Him and, having this vail over the eyes of their understanding, they would not know that He is God even though He is seen as Man, needs did He address them saying, <i>When ye have lifted up the Son of Man then shall ye know that </i>I <i>am, </i>i. e., when ye cease from your slight and grovelling conception of Me, when ye have some lofty and super-mundane thought of Me, and believe that I am God of God, even though for your sakes I am become Man as you, then shall ye know clearly that I <i>am the Light of the world </i>(for this I just now told you): for what would any longer hinder (He says) Him Who is wholly admitted to be Very God, from being also Light of the world? For not to so great depth of madness and daring will any go as then too to venture to say, <i>Thy record is not true, </i>for he will in no wise accuse what God by Nature and Very shall say.</p><p>It is then most evident from the words too of the Saviour, <a name="p601"><span><font color="#000000">|601</font></span></a> that if we have a mean opinion of Him and consider Him to be bare Man and bereft of the Godhead by Nature, we shall surely both disbelieve Him and not admit Him as Saviour and Redeemer. And what is the result? we have fallen from our hope. For if salvation is through faith and faith be gone, what will yet save us? But if we believe and lift up to God-befitting height the Only-Begotten even though He hath become Man, advancing as with a fair wind and speeding across the all-troublous sea of life, we shall safe moor in the city that is above, there to receive the rewards of believing.</p><blockquote><p><i>The same in another way. </i></p><blockquote><p><i>When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that </i>I <i>am.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having with many and good words bathed the wrath of the Jews, He sees it not a whit the less swelling. For they cease not heedlessly blaspheming, yea at one time they set aside His Speech and impiously call Him a liar: for to say <i>Thy record is not true, </i>what else is it than this? at another time again, to Him out of love declaring the things that belong to salvation and on this account saying, <i>If ye believe not that </i>I <i>am, ye shall die in your sins, </i>they began hotly to oppose Him and arraying against those utterances of love their words of madness said, <i>Who art </i>THOU? For them therefore who thus unmitigatedly wallowed in unreasoning audacity there was need of a word that should sober them and persuade them to be more gently disposed and put a bridle on their tongue even against its will. Therefore was He threatening them telling them most clearly that they shall not escape punishment for their impiety, but even though they see Him for the present forbearing, yet when their impiety towards Him has gone forth to its dread consummation, I mean Death and the Cross, they shall undergo all-dread justice and shall receive in return intolerable lot, that of the war with the Romans, which after the Saviour's Cross befell them from the wrath above from God. And that they should suffer all-terrible things, the Saviour again signified more <a name="p602"><span><font color="#000000">|602</font></span></a> clearly to them saying, at one time to the weeping women, <i>Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for Me but weep for yourselves and for your children, </i>at another again, <i>When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then shall ye say to the mountains, Cover us and to the hills, Fall on us </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#20" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">20</font></u></sup></a>. For to such an extent do the sufferings of the war overcome the Jews, that every kind of death was to them pleasanter and rather to be chosen than the trial of them: their removal from their country, the enslavements of those who inhabit it and their most savage slaughter and the famines in every city and their child-devourings therein Josephus too relates in his history.</p><p><i>When </i>then (He says) ye having betrayed to the cross <i>the Son of man </i>endure your retributive punishment, and pay penalties correspondent to your daring deeds against Me, <i>then shall ye </i>weeping <i>know that </i>I <i>am </i>the All-Powerful, that is God. For if one sparrow enter not the snare of the fowler without the will of God,<i> </i>how shall a whole country, (He saith) and the beloved <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#21" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">21</font></u></sup></a> nation go on to destruction so complete, except God supreme over all had surely permitted that so it should be? Evil therefore and all-dread is the contempt of God which bringeth to the consummation of things to be deprecated. Wherefore Paul too rebuketh some, saying of God, <i>Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God is leading thee to repentance, but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath in the Day of wrath?</i></p><blockquote><p><i>The same in another way</i></p></blockquote><p>Christ spent long time dwelling with the Jews, and speaking in every synagogue, so to say, and addressing them every sabbath-day and, setting before them often and ungrudgingly profitable teaching, was continually inviting them to the illumination through the Spirit, and verily He <a name="p603"><span><font color="#000000">|603</font></span></a> saith, in that He is God by Nature and Very, I <i>am the light of the world; </i>but they thinking most foolishly were ever gainsaying Him who said these things, for (says he) THOU <i>bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not true. </i>And not at contradictions in words did the daring of the Jews stay, nor only in love of reviling was their untamed audacity consummated, but going without stint through all savageness, they at last betrayed Him both to Cross and Death. But since He was by Nature Life, having burst the bonds of death, He arose from the dead and (as was reasonable) departs from Jewish defilement and hasted away from Israel and that with justice, and betaking Himself to the Gentiles, He invited all to the Light, <i>and to the blind </i>He freely bestowed recovery <i>of sight. </i>It befell then that after the Death on the Cross of our Saviour Christ, the understandings of the Jews were darkened, in that the Light had departed forth from them, and that the hearts of the Gentiles were enlightened, in that the Very Light beamed upon them. <i>When </i>then, He says, <i>ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that </i>I <i>am, </i>instead of, I will await the consummation of your impiety, I will not bring upon you wrath before its time, I will accept the Passion and Death, I will endure along with the rest this too. But when ye shall betray to the Cross <i>the Son of Man </i>deemed by you to be bare man, <i>then shall ye know, </i>even against your will, that not falsely have I said <i>that </i>I <i>am </i>the Light of the world. For when ye see yourselves darkened, the innumerable multitude of the Gentiles enlightened by having Me with them, how will ye not even against your will agree that <i>I am </i>of a truth <i>the light of the world? </i>For that the Saviour was going to depart from the Synagogue of the Jews after His coming to Life again from the dead, is doubtful to none (for it has been accomplished and done): yet may one see it somehow (yea even clearly) from His words, <i>While ye have the Light walk in the Light, lest darkness come upon you. </i>For the repression and withdrawal of light generates darkness, and again the presence of light causes darkness to vanish. Therefore  is Christ shewn as being of a truth Light, Who <a name="p604"><span><font color="#000000">|604</font></span></a> darkened the Jews through His Departure from them, and enlightened the Gentiles through His Presence with them: and a bitter lesson to the Jews was their experience of dread things.</p><blockquote><p><i>The same in another way</i></p><blockquote><p><i>When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that </i>I <i>am.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Since looking only (He says) to the flesh, ye believe that I am mere Man, and deem that I am one like yourselves, but the Dignity of the Godhead and the Glory from thence, do not so much as enter your mind:----a most evident token to you of My being God of Truly God and Light of Light, shall be your all-dread and most lawless deed of daring, the Cross that is and the Death of the Flesh thereupon. For when ye see the issue of your mad folly frustrate of its purpose and the snare of death crushed in pieces (for I shall surely rise from the dead): then shall ye even against your will and of necessity at length assent to what I said to you and shall confess that I am by Nature God. For I shall be superior to death and decay, I being by Nature Life shall raise again My Temple. But if to overmaster death and to triumph over the meshes of corruption belong to Him Who is by Nature God and to no other being, how shall I not (all contradiction and all doubt being removed) be shewn thereby to overcome all things mightily and without trouble? therefore does the Saviour say that His Cross shall be a sign to the Jews and a most evident demonstration of His being by Nature God.</p><p>And this you may see Him elsewhere too, clearly saying: for when many and unnumbered prodigies had been shewn forth by Him, the Pharisees once came to Him tempting Him and saying, <i>Master, we would see a sign from Thee. </i>But He since He saw the imaginations which were going on in them, and was not ignorant that they were bitterly minded, says, <i>An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas; for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the</i> <a name="p605"><span><font color="#000000">|605</font></span></a> <i>whale's belly, so shall the Son of man too be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </i>Hearest thou how to the Jews asking a sign as a proof that He is God by Nature, even though they said it tempting Him, He says that no other shall be shewn to them save <i>the sign of the prophet Jonas, </i>i. e. the three days death and the coming to life again from the dead? For what token of God-befitting authority so great and manifest, as to undo death and overthrow decay, albeit by Divine sentence having the mastery over human nature? For in Adam it heard, <i>Dust thou </i>art <i>and unto dust shalt thou return; </i>but it was in the power of Christ the Saviour both to end His Anger, and by blessings to overthrow the death which from His curse prevailed. But that the Jews exceedingly feared the sign of the resurrection as mighty to convince that Christ is by Nature God, their final deed will clearly tell us, for when they heard of the Resurrection of the Saviour, and that He was not found in the tomb, terrified and exceeding fearful thereat, they planned to buy off the informations of the soldiers by large money. For they gave them money to say, <i>His disciples came by night and stole Him while we slept. </i>Mighty therefore is the sign of the Resurrection, having undoubted demonstration that Jesus is God, whereat the hard and unbending heart of the Jews was sore troubled. <a name="p606"><span><font color="#000000">|606</font></span></a> </p><blockquote><p><b>CHAPTER <span><a name="C5"></a>V.</span> That not inferior in Might and Wisdom to God the Father is the Son, yea rather His very Wisdom and Might.</b></p><blockquote><p><i>And of Myself I do nothing, but as the Father taught Me, I speak these words.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He speaketh in more human wise, in that the Jews could not otherwise understand, nor endure to hear from Him unvailed things God-befitting. For on these matters are they found hurling stones at Him, and setting it down as blasphemy, that <i>being Man, </i>He made Himself <i>God. </i>Withdrawing therefore the surpassingness of God-befitting glory and having much bereft His language of its splendour, He condescends most excellently to the infirmities of the hearers, and since searching into their mind within He finds that they know Him not to be God, He fashions His Discourse in human wise, that their dispositions may not be again kindled unto anger and they foolishly dart away from cleaving to Him even a little. <i>Ye shall know </i>therefore (He says) <i>when ye have lifted up the Son of Man, that </i>I <i>am, </i>ye shall know again in like manner that <i>of Myself I do nothing, but as My Father taught Me, so I speak.</i></p><p>And what need of these words (tell me) may some one haply say, and what does Christ teach us herein? Therefore we will say, piously and with fair distinction expanding<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>each of the things said; Ye have never ceased (He saith) falling upon My Deeds, as though wrought madly and un-holily, ye condemned Me oft as not refusing to transgress, as wont to act contrary to the Lawgiver. For I loosed the paralytic from his so great infirmity, I compassionated a man on the sabbath. But seeing (He saith) you who ought to have wondered at it, finding fault thereat and missing much of what befit Me, yea even just now I explaining to <a name="p607"><span><font color="#000000">|607</font></span></a> you what belongs to salvation was persuading you to advance to the desire of sharing in light. Then did I shew you the Very Light, for declaring to you Mine own Nature, I said, I <i>am the light of the world, </i>and YE acting and counselling most unadvisedly, rose up against My words and dared unrestrainedly to say, <i>Thy record is not true. When </i>then <i>ye have lifted up the Son of man, </i>that is, when ye compass Him about with death and behold Him superior to the bonds of death (for I shall rise from the dead, since I am God by Nature) then <i>ye shall know </i>(He says) <i>that I do nothing of Myself but as My Father taught Me so I speak. </i>For ye will learn when ye see that the Son too is God by Nature, that I am by no means self-opiniate, but ever of one Will with God the Father, and whatsoever He doth, these things I too do not shrink from doing and whatever I know that He speaks, I again speak. For I am of the Same Essence as He That begat Me. For I healed the palsied on the sabbath day, YE again were bitterly disposed thereat, yet shewed I you My Father working on the sabbath also: for I said, <i>My Father worketh hitherto and I work: </i>therefore <i>of Myself I do nothing. </i>Again I said, I <i>am the Light of the world, </i>but ye imagined that I was saying something discordant from the Father and in this too did I again shame you, shewing that He said of Me, <i>Behold I have set Thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the nations. </i>In vain therefore (He saith) do ye accuse Him Who ever hath One Will with the Father and doth nought dissonant to Him nor endureth to say ought which is not His. For this is the meaning I think that we should fit on to the words.</p><p>But the bitter wild beast will haply leap upon us, the fighter against Christ, I mean Arius, and will cry out upon us (as is likely) and will come and say, "When the discourse, sir, was proceeding all right, what made you pressing forward thrust it aside to your own mere pleasure and do you not blush at secretly stealing away the force of the truth? Lo clearly the Son affirms that He does nought of Himself, but that what He learns of God the Father, this He also speaks, and so is conscious that His Father is in superior position to Himself." <a name="p608"><span><font color="#000000">|608</font></span></a> </p><p>What then, most excellent sir (will such an one hear in return), is the Son supplied with might and understanding from the Father, that He may be able to do and to speak without blame? how then is He any longer God by Nature, who borrows from another power and wisdom, just as the nature of the creature too has it? for to those who from not being obtain being, every thing that accrues to them is also surely God-given. But not so is it in the Son; for Him the Divine Scripture knows and proclaims as Very God and I think that to Him Who is by Nature God do all good things in perfect degree belong, and that which possesses not perfection in every single thing that ought to be admired, how will it be by Nature God? For as incorruption and immortality must surely belong to it naturally and not from without or imported, so too the all-perfection and lacking nought in all good things. But if according, sir, to thy unhallowed and unlearned argument the Son be imperfect in regard of being able to do things God-befitting and to speak what is right, and yet He is the Power and Wisdom of the Father according to the Divine Scripture, to the Father rather and not to Him will so great an accusal belong. For thus defining these things you will say that in potential no longer is God the Father Perfect, nor yet is He wholly Wise. You see then whither the daring of thine unlearning sinks down. And I marvel how this too has escaped thy acumen.: how (tell me) will God the Father supply might to His own Might, or how will He render His own Wisdom wiser? For either one must needs say that it ever advances to something greater and goes forward by little and little to being capable of somewhat more than its existing strength (which is both foolish and utterly impossible), or must impiously suppose that He is strengthened by another. How then will the Son be any more called <i>Lord of Hosts </i>or how will He be any longer conceived of as Wisdom and Might, strengthened (according to you) and made wise by another? Away with the blasphemy and absurdity of reasoning. For either grant outright that the Son is a creature that ye may have the whole of Divinely-inspired <a name="p609"><span><font color="#000000">|609</font></span></a> Scripture crying out against you, or if ye believe that He is by Nature God, grant, grant that the Properties of Godhead pertain to Him in Perfect degree. For it is the property of the Natural Being [of God <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#22" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">22</font></u></sup></a>] neither to be impotent about anything, nor to come short of supreme Wisdom, yea rather to be Wisdom and Power's very self; but in wisdom nought is through teaching, nor yet in the Chief and truly conceived-of Power do we see imported power.</p><p>But that by examining also the very nature of things, we may more accurately test what are said by Christ, we will add this too to what has been said. What so great deed hath the Only-Begotten made Man wrought, that will surpass His inherent Power? For it was like I suppose that some would say that it then resulted that He should fitly say, as having borrowed the Power from God the Father, <i>Of Myself I do nothing, </i>because He drove out the evil spirit, let go the palsied from his infirmity, freed the leper from his suffering, gave the blind to see, sated a no easily reckoned multitude of men with five loaves, appeased the raging sea with a word, raised Lazarus from the dead: shall we say that the manifestation herein is superior to His innate Power? Then how (tell me) did He stablish the so great Heaven and spread it <i>out as a tent to dwell in, </i>how founded He the earth, how became He Artificer of sun and moon and what pertains to the firmament? how created He angels and Archangels Thrones and Lordships and yet besides, the Seraphim? He Who was in so vast and supernatural position, lacking neither Might nor Wisdom from another, how could He be powerless in matters so small, or how should He Who by the holy Prophets is glorified as Wisdom need one who must teach Him what to say to the Jews? For I hear a certain one say, <i>The Lord who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His Wisdom, and stretched out the heavens in His discretion, </i>and besides, the Divine Daniel too says. <i>Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever, for wisdom and understanding and might are His.   </i>But if His, according to the Prophet's voice, are both <a name="p610"><span><font color="#000000">|610</font></span></a> <i>might and wisdom, </i>who will any more endure the wordiness<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>of the heterodox, saying that the Wisdom and Power of the Father is supplied with both power and wisdom from another?</p><p>"But if we said (says he) that there were some other to supply to the Son what He lacked of power, or to teach Him, reasonably could ye attack us with words, knowing that ye were on the side of Him as insulted: but since we say that God the Father gives this, what plea for aggrievance any longer appears to you from thence?"</p><p>Therefore if ye think that ye will in nothing wrong the Son, in respect of His being by Nature unlike Him Who begat Him, even though He be said to be supplied by Him, remember, man, your late words, and be taught thereby not to be offended: grant Him to be in all things Equal to His Progenitor, and in no way or respect whatever inferior to Him. But if it draw thee aside from the reasonings of orthodoxy, and persuade thee to deem of Him what is not lawful, why dost thou vainly attempt to beguile us with so rotten words? for it will make no difference at all, whether God the Father Himself, or any other than He, be said to give ought to the Son. For having once fallen under the charge of receiving ought, what gain will He derive, though the Person of the Giver were exceeding illustrious? For what difference (tell me) will it make to a person who refuses a blow to be struck with a wooden rod or a gilt one? for it is not the suffering in this way that is good but the not suffering at all. The Son therefore being proved to be lacking in both power and wisdom, if He be shewn to receive ought from Him, and having herein complete accusal, how is it not utterly foolish that we should smite our hearers with stale words, and by inventions of deceit smear over the charge by deeming that no one else but the Father Alone is admitted as supplying Him? But I marvel how though they think they are wise, and in no slight degree practised in the art of making subtle distinctions with words foreign to the subject, that this escaped them, viz.,<sub><font size="3"> </font></sub>that by disparaging the Impress of God the Father, i. e., <a name="p611"><span><font color="#000000">|611</font></span></a> the Son, ye do not so much accuse Himself as Him Whose Impress He is, since He must of necessity so be as He is seen to be in the Son.</p><p>"But," says he, "the Son's own voice will compel thee even against thy will to consent to what He did not disdain to utter: for Himself hath confessed that He doth <i>nothing of Himself </i>but that whatever He was <i>taught </i>of God the <i>Father these things </i>He speaks."</p><p>Well then to thee, good sir, let the things even that are well said seem to be not well, seeing that thou deniedst the light of truth: but WE again will go our own way, and will deem of the Only-Begotten as is customary and wonted, with becoming piety comparing them with what is before us. For if the Only-Begotten had said, <i>I do nothing of Myself </i>but receiving power from God the Father, I both work wonders and am marvelled at, it would be even thus a speech shewing that He nowise ought to be accused therefore, yet would our opponent have seemed to oppose us with greater shew of reason. But since He says simply and absolutely without any addition, <i>I</i> <i>do nothing of Myself, </i>we will not surely say that He is blaming His own Nature as infirm for ought, but that He means something else that is true and incapable of being found fault with. In order that transforming the force of the expression to man, we may see accurately what He says, let there be two men having the same nature, equal in strength and likeminded one with another, and let one of them say, Of myself I do nothing, will he say this as powerless and able to do nothing at all of himself, or as having the other co-approver and co-minded and co-joined with him? thus conceive I pray of the Son too, yea rather much more than this. For since the Jews were foolishly springing upon Him as He was working marvels, even accusing the breach of the sabbath, and imputing to Him transgression of the law, He at length shewed God the Father in all things Co-minded and Co-approver, skillfully shaming the unbridled mind of them who believe Him not.    For it was like that some would now shrink from any inclination to blame Him when He said <a name="p612"><span><font color="#000000">|612</font></span></a> that He did all things according to the Will of the Father and pointed out His own Will in His. For that the Son does all things according to the Will of the Father will shew that He is not less and an under-worker, but of Him and in Him and Consubstantial. For since He is the Very Wisdom of the Father and His Living Counsel, He confesses that He does not do ought else than what the Father wills, Whose both Wisdom and Counsel He is, seeing that the understanding too that is in us does not ought of itself, but accomplishes all that seems good to us. And little is the example to the verity, but it hath an image not obscure of the truth. And as the understanding that is in us is accounted nought else than we ourselves, in the same way I deem the Wisdom of God the Father, i. e., the Son, is nought other than He in regard to sameness of Essence and exact Likeness of Nature: for the Father is Father and the Son Son in Their own Person.</p><p>But because to this He adds, <i>As the Father taught Me, I speak these things, </i>let no one think that the Son is in need of teaching for any thing whatsoever (for great is the absurdity of reasoning herein): but the force of what is said has this meaning. For the Jews who were not able to understand ought that was good, were not only offended at what were marvellously wrought, but also when ought God-befitting was uttered one may see them in the same case, and specially when He truly says, I <i>am the Light of the world, </i>they were both cut to the heart and counselled all-daring deeds. But the Lord Jesus Christ that He might convict them of vainly raging about this says that His own Words are God the Father's, saying <i>Taught </i>in more human wise. Yet we shall find the force of the speech not without a subtle inner-thought, and if the enemy of the truth will not admit what is human, he very greatly wrongs the plan of the economy with Flesh (for the Only-Begotten humbled Himself being made Man, and for this reason ofttimes He speaketh as Man): but let him know again that the saying, <i>As the Father taught Me, so I speak, </i>will no way injure the Son in respect of <a name="p613"><span><font color="#000000">|613</font></span></a> God-befitting Dignity, for we will show that this saying of His too is on all sides sound and right. But let yon accuser of the doctrines of piety answer us who ask, Who (tell me) teaches the new-born babe to use human voice? why does he not roar as a lion or imitate some other of the irrational creation? But nature its teacher fashioning after the property of the sower that which is of him must needs surely and will proceed to that common sound used by all. It is then possible without being taught to learn of nature which infuseth so to say the whole property of the sower into tho offspring. Thus therefore does tho Only-Begotten Himself here too affirm that He learned of the Father. For what nature is to us, that full surely may God the Father be reasonably conceived of to Him; and as WE since we are men and of men, learning untaught from nature speak as befits men, so He too, since He is God of God by Nature, learnt as of His Own Nature to speak as God and to say things befitting God, as is I <i>am the Light of the world. </i>For what He knows that He is because of the Father from Whom He is (for He is Light of Light), this He said that He learnt of Him, having a sort of untaught learning of God-befitting works and words from the own Nature of Him Who begat Him, mounting up as by necessary laws to sameness in all things of will and of word with God the Father. For how must not sameness of Will and Equality and Likeness in Words needs be without contradiction inexistent in Those Who have the Same Nature? Of God altogether are we speaking, not of us; for us divergences of manners and differences of wills and tyrannies of passions drag aside from the limits of what befits: but the Divine and Inconceivable Nature being the Same always and fixed immoveably in Its own Goods, what divergences unto ought else can It have? or how will It not altogether advance the straight course of Its own Purpose and both speak and accomplish what belongs to It? The Only-Begotten then being of the Same Essence with Him Who begat Him and pre-eminent in the Dignities of the One Godhead, will (I suppose) surely and of necessity work whatever <a name="p614"><span><font color="#000000">|614</font></span></a> the Father Himself too works (for this is the meaning of doing <i>nothing of Himself)</i>; and will surely speak what belongs to Him Who begat Him, not as a minister or bidden or as a disciple, but possessing as the fruit of His Own Nature, to use the words also of God the Father. For herein shines forth clearly and apart from all railing this, viz. that nothing is said by Him [as from Himself].</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>29 <i>And He That sent Me is with Me, and hath not left Me alone.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p> </p><p>Herein He shews clearly that He interprets the Counsel of God the Father, Himself having none other than is in Him (how could He? for He is Himself the Living and Hypostatic Counsel and Will of Him Who begat Him, as is said in the Book of the Psalms by one of the Saints, <i>In Thy Counsel Thou guidedst me, </i>and again, <i>Lord by Thy Will Thou gavest might to my beauty : </i>for in Christ are all good things to them that love Him) but as bringing forth unto our knowledge the things that are in God the Father. For as this word of ours uttered externally and poured forth through the tongue makes known what is in the deep of our understanding, both receiving, as some learning, the will that is in our mind in respect of anything, and impelled by it to utter it in such manner: so again we will piously conceive that the Son (surpassing the force of the example in that He is Himself both Word and Wisdom of God the Father) uttered what exists in Him. And since He is not impersonal as is man's, but inbeing and Living as having His own Being in the Father and with the Father, He says here that He is not <i>Alone, </i>but that <i>with </i>Him is Him also <i>That sent </i>Him. But when He says, <i>With Me, </i>He indicates again something God-befitting and Mystic. For we do not think that He saith thus, viz. that as God may be (for instance) with a Prophet, guarding him, that is, with His own Might and aiding him by His favour or by the enlightenment through the Spirit stirring him up to prophecy:----that so is He That begat Him with Him. But here too He puts <i>with Me </i>in another sense: <font color="#ff0000"><a name="p615"><span>|615</span></a></font> for <i>He That sent Me </i>(He says) i. e., God the Father, is in the same Nature as I.</p><p>After this sort will you understand that too which is in Isaiah the Prophet about Christ, <i>Know ye people and he ye worsted for with us </i>is <i>God. </i>For our discourse hereon will befit those who have set on Him their hope of being saved. And these too say <i>With us </i>is <i>God, </i>not as though any should imagine that God will be our co-worker and co-assistant, but that He will be <i>with us, </i>that is, of us. For the Word of God hath become Man, and in Him we all have been saved and burst the bonds of death, and put off the corruption of sin, since God the Word being in the Form of God hath come down to us and become <i>with us. </i>As then we here understand <i>With us </i>is <i>God, </i>for, The Word of God the Father hath become of the same nature with us: so here too preserving the same analogy in our thoughts, when Christ says, <i>He that sent Me is with Me and hath not left Me alone, </i>we shall clearly understand Him to indicate mystically that (as we said before) God the Father is of the Same Nature as I <i>and hath not left Me alone : </i>for it were altogether impossible not to have wholly with Me God the Father of Whom I am begotten.</p><p>And perhaps some one will say and will ask more thoughtfully, Why does the Saviour say such things or what was it induced Him to come to this explanation ?</p><p>To this WE will reply, shewing that profitably and of necessity did He add this too to what He had already said. For since He said that <i>as the Father taught Me, I speak these things, </i>needs does He shew that the Father is now co-with Him and consubstantial with Him, that He may be believed to speak what is His, as God the things of God, and urged on by the Natural Property of Him That begat Him to say what is God-befitting, just as the children of men having of their nature some untaught learning, as we said above, know truly the properties of human nature. We must not therefore be offended, when the Son says that He learnt ought from the Father; for not for this reason will He be found less than He nor yet alien according to <a name="p616"><span><font color="#000000">|616</font></span></a> them. And let us consider the matter thus. Not in knowing any thing or in not knowing it, is the matter of essence tested, but in what each by nature is. As for example suppose Paul and Silvanus; and let Paul know and be instructed perfectly in the mystery as to Christ, Silvanus somewhat less than Paul. Are they then not alike in nature or will Paul surpass Silvanus in respect of essence, because he knows the depth of the mystery more than the other? But I suppose that no one will be foolish to such an extent as ever to suppose that their nature is severed by reason of superiority or inferiority in knowledge. When then the condition of essence is (as we have said) accurately proved not to lie in learning or teaching ought, it will no wise injure the Son in regard of His being by Nature God, if He say that He learns ought of His own Father. For not on this account will He go forth from Consubstantiality with Him, but abideth wholly what He is, God of God, Light of Light.</p><p>But you will perhaps say, How then? the Father is greater in knowledge, for therefore doth He teach the Son. But we again will say that we have entirely shewn through many words that the Wisdom of the Father is without any need of learning and instruction and having joined together many arguments thereto, we proved that their speech has its exit in boundless blasphemy. Next, it is necessary to tell thee besides that the Son's aim and special care<i> </i>is ever to abate His own Dignity and not to speak much in God-befitting manner, because of the Form of the servant and of the abasement thence for our sakes undertaken. For whither hath He descended, and whence unto what removed, if He say nothing inferior and not wholly worthy of God-befitting glory? For for these reasons He often takes the form of not knowing as Man what as God He knows. You will see this clearly in the history of Lazarus of Bethany, whom when now of four days and stinking, He with wonder-working might and most God-befitting voice caused to return to life. Look at the economy fashioned herein.    For knowing that Lazarus was dead and having <a name="p617"><span><font color="#000000">|617</font></span></a> fore-announced this, as God, to His disciples, in human wise Ho asked, saying, <i>Where have ye laid him? </i>O wondrous deed! He Who was living far away from Bethany and was not ignorant as God, that Lazarus is dead, how sought He to learn where the tomb was? But you will say (thinking most rightly) that He made feint of the question, arranging something profitable. Receive therefore in this case too that He economically says that what He knows as God, this He learnt of the Father; not permitting the mad folly of the Jews to be further excited, and punishing the wrath of the more unlearned, He does not introduce God-befitting language to them unsoftened, although it rather befitted Him so to do.</p><p>But since they were surmising that He is yet mere man, He mingling as it were the Dignity of Godhead with man-befitting words speaks economically more lowly than Ho is, <i>For </i>I <i>do always the things that please Him. </i>Receive (I pray) herein too the solution of what seem hard and observe clearly that He rightly interprets. <i>Of Myself </i>I <i>do nothing. </i>For for this reason (He says) testified I that <i>I do nothing of Myself, </i>when I but now addressed you, because it is My habit and practice to do nothing discordant to God the Father, nor to be able to do anything save what pleaseth My Progenitor. It is then very clear that in this alone will it be understood that the Son doth <i>nothing of </i>Himself, viz. in His ever doing what pleases God the Father, so that except He had thus wrought, He would have done somewhat of Himself, i.e., contrary to the Will of Him That begat Him. It is not then because He comes short of the Paternal Goodness, nor because of being able to achieve nought of His own Strength, that He here affirms that He does nothing of Himself, but because He is Co-minded and Co-willer ever with His Progenitor in every thing, and has no thought of ever accomplishing any thing as it were separately. And we do not, going off into extravagant notions, think that the Son is here displaying in Himself any virtue proceeding of choice and habit, but rather the Fruit of Nature That knows no turning, Which <a name="p618"><span><font color="#000000">|618</font></span></a> needs not the Divine [help] in counselling to do anything. For as to the creatures, inasmuch as they are capable of turning to the worse, and of giving way to changes from better to worse, good will be fruit of the pious and virtuous disposition: but as to the Divine and All-Surpassing Nature it is not so. For since all change and turn is removed and has no place, good will be the fruit of the unalterable Nature, just as heat in fire or cold in snow. For fire has obviously its proper action, not of voluntary notion, but natural and essential, without the power of being otherwise except it be driven away from its action by the will of its Maker. Therefore not as WE, or ought other of the rational creation, mastered by our free will to press forward to do what pleases God the Father; not so does the Only-Begotten say thus, but as following the laws of His own Nature and able to think and do nought save according to the Will of Him Who begat Him. For how could the Consubstantial and One Godhead ever be at variance with Itself? or how could It do what liketh It not, as though any had power to turn it aside unto ought else? For though God the Father exist properly and by Himself, likewise both the Son and the Spirit, yet is the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity not riven asunder unto complete severance, but the whole Fulness thereof mounteth up unto One Nature of Godhead.</p><p>We must besides consider this too, that no argument can reasonably pull down the Son from His sameness of Nature with the Father, seeing that He affirmed that He <i>always </i>doth <i>what pleaseth Him, </i>but rather being Consubstantial with Him will He be thereby acknowledged to be God of God by Nature and Very. For who (tell me) will savour the things of God after a God-befitting and exact manner, except Himself too be by Nature God? or who will perform always what is pleasing to Him, if he have not a nature beyond the reach of the worse, and have for his share the choice Dignity of the Divine Nature, I mean being unable to sin? For of the creature it has been said, <i>Who will boast that he has his heart clean, or who will be confident that </i> <a name="p619"><span><font color="#000000">|619</font></span></a> <i>he is pure from sins, </i>and elsewhere the Divine Scripture extending its utterance even to the very utmost bound<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>says, <i>The stars are not pure in His Sight. </i>For angels, albeit far removed from our condition, and having a firmer status as to virtue, have <i>not kept their own princedom. </i>For by reason of some being altogether torn thence and falling into sin, the whole nature of the rational creation lies under the charge of being recipient of sin, and powerless to be imparticipate of change for the worse: and the reasonable and godlike living creature upon the earth hath fallen, not after any long period, but in the first man Adam. Wholly therefore refused to the creature is unchangeability and un-turning and being able to be of nature the same<i>; </i>to God Alone That is in truth will it belong. But this shines forth full well in the Son, for He <i>did no sin, </i>as Paul saith, <i>neither was guile found in His Mouth. </i>God therefore is the Son, and by Nature of God who cannot sin, nor over overstep what befits His Nature. When then He confesses that He does <i>always those things that please </i>the Father, let no one be offended, nor deem that in lesser rank than the Father is He who is of Him, but let him rather think piously that as God of God by Nature He ascendeth unto the sameness of counsel and (so to speak) sameness of work with Him Who begat Him.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>30 <i>As He spake these words, many believed on Him.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The wise Evangelist ofttimes marvels at Christ practising depreciation in His Words because of the infirmity of the hearers, and wont to achieve something great thereby. For whereas it was in His Power as God to speak all things, and to fashion His Discourse free and with royal Authority over all, keeping measure in His Speech economically, He encloses many unto obedience, many again He persuades to give heed more zealously unto Him. Therefore not empty is the Saviour's purpose, I mean His speaking to the multitudes in more human wise: for some of the more unlearned were used to rage against Him not a little and readily to desert Him, beholding a man and hearing God-befitting <a name="p620"><span><font color="#000000">|620</font></span></a> words. But since He was God and Man in one, having unblamed the authority that pertains to each, and able to speak without fault in whatever way He please, He doing exceeding well fashioned it in view of the levity of His hearers, diversely declaring of Himself (and that often) the things that belong to a man, such (I mean) as <i>Of Myself I do nothing </i>and things akin to this: for they understanding nothing whatever, but attacking without any investigation what was said, went to this common and offhand<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>mode of understanding it, and thought that He said, Receiving power of God I work miracles, and He is with Me, since I do always what is pleasing to Him.</p><p>Likeminded then with the unholy Jews are the accursed enemies of the Truth, who contradicting the dogmas of piety and loving to wrangle, think meanly of the Lord, and seizing on what is economically and rightly said, to overturn therewith His inbeing Glory and Authority, they steal away the Beauty of the Truth. For they have not (it seems) remembered Paul who saith that one ought to cast <i>down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God </i>and to bring <i>into captivity every thought </i>to <i>Christ </i>and to His <i>obedience:</i> they have not known what was uttered concerning the Divine Oracles by one of the Prophets, <i>Who </i>is <i>wise and he shall understand these </i>things? <i>prudent and he shall know them? </i>For unless some exceeding great obscurity hovered upon them, and a deep darksome veil floated over, what were the need for a <i>wise </i>and <i>prudent </i>man being sought after who might find out the knowledge of them?</p><p>And this is abundance for the present matter, we will speak rather on what is before us, choosing something profitable. Upon Christ when saying these things, there <i>believed on Him, </i>as saith the Evangelist, not all but <i>many. </i>Yet albeit He is Very God, and hath nought that is not wholly <i>naked unto His Eyes </i>and knows and that with all accuracy that He will not take hold of all unto belief, He yet perseveres, expending long discourse on them who come to Him, giving us an Example most fair in this too, and <a name="p621"><span><font color="#000000">|621</font></span></a> offering Himself a Pattern to the Teachers of the Church. For even though all be haply not profited because of their own depravity, yet since it was likely that some would reap good thereby, we must not be sluggish to lead to what is profitable. For if we bury so to say in unfruitful silence the talent given us, that is, the grace through the Spirit, we shall be like that wicked servant who said without any restraint to his Master, <i>I knew Thee that Thou art an hard man reaping where Thou didst not sow and gathering whence Thou didst not straw and I was afraid and hid Thy talent in the earth, lo, Thou hast Thine own. </i>But to what end that so wretched man came, and what penalty He exacted of him, the studious man well knows having met with it not once only in the Gospel books. Therefore let us lay this to heart and consider aright that it is his duty to be free from all indolence in teaching, his I mean who is set forth<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>for this work, and in no wise to turn aside to despise it, even though all be not persuaded by his words, but rather shalt thou rejoice at what thou gainest by thy toil. It is meet too to consider with all sobriety that which has been spoken by our Saviour, <i>The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord: enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord. </i>For if the Lord persuade not all on account of the crookedness and hardness of heart of the hearers, who will blame our feeble speech, though it demand understanding of free-choice not of necessity?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>31    <i>Jesus said therefore to the Jews which believed on Him, If </i>YE <i>abide in My word, ye are My disciples indeed.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He demandeth of those who believe a disposition established and fixed and prepared for the abode of that good which they had once chosen. And this is faith in Him. For wavering shews utter senselessness and unprofit, seeing that <i>A double minded man </i>is <i>unstable in all his ways, </i>as it is written: but to press forward firmly to have hold of what is profitable, is indeed wise and most useful. As far then as belongs to the more obvious meaning, He says <a name="p622"><span><font color="#000000">|622</font></span></a> this, that if they shall desire to obey His Words, then shall they be surely called His disciples also. But as regards some hidden meaning, He signifies this: for in saying <i>If </i>YE <i>abide in My Word, </i>He is clearly withdrawing them by degrees and gently from the Mosaic teachings, and removing them from adherence to the letter and bidding them no longer cleave to what were uttered and done in type, but rather to His own Word which is clearly the Gospel and Divine preaching. For He it was Who ever of old was speaking to us through the holy Prophets, but they were the mediators, through whom (that is) He spake to us. But the Gospel preaching will be conceived of as properly His Word (for not through another do we find that it came to us but through Himself) wherefore when Incarnate He says, <i>I That speak am present. </i>And Paul too will testify saying in the Epistle to the Hebrews, <i>God Who in many ways and modes of old spake unto the fathers by the prophets in these last times spake unto us by the Son. </i>Himself therefore a worker unto teaching hath the Son come to us at the last periods of the world: therefore will the Gospel teaching be rightly called His Word. It were meet then more nakedly and openly to say, Ye who have accepted the faith in Me, and though late have yet acknowledged Him Who of old is preached unto you by the law and prophets, no longer be ye attached to the types through Moses, nor be persuaded to cleave to the shadows of the law, nor lay it down that the power of salvation consists wholly in them, but in the spiritual teachings, and in the Gospel preachings that are through Me. But it was not unlikely, yea rather it was undoubted, that receiving but now and hardly the faith, and having their understanding shaken and ready for unsettling, they would not endure such words, nor would at all hold out, in that they are ever prone to anger, but as though the all-wise Moses were hereby insulted, and put to nought because the things appointed to them of old through him were despised:----they would have turned readily to their proper daring and, ever set upon agreeing with him, thought nothing of any longer believing on Christ.    Economically therefore <a name="p623"><span><font color="#000000">|623</font></span></a> and veiledly as yet arranging the things of Moses in contrast with His own words, i. e., putting the Gospel preaching over against the law, and setting the new teachings in very superior place to the elder ones. He says, <i>If </i>YE <i>continue in My Word, </i>verily <i>ye are My disciples, </i>for they who are pre-eminent in perfect faith and unhesitatingly receive into their mind the Gospel teaching, not unduly regarding the shadow of the law, are in truth disciples of Christ, while they who act not thus, mock themselves, not able to be in truth <i>disciples, </i>and therefore falling away from salvation. And verily the blessed Paul to those who after the faith foolishly desire to be justified by the law, openly writes, <i>Ye were set free </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#23" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">23</font></u></sup></a> <i>from Christ, whosoever of you are justified by the law, ye fell from grace. </i>Wondrous then and precious is single<i> </i>faith and the desire closely to follow Christ, drawing the shadows of the law unto the knowledge of Him, and transfashioning the things darkly spoken unto spiritual instruction. For through the law and the prophets is preached the Mystery of Him.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>32    <i>And ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Obscure as yet and not wholly clear is the word, none the less it is replete with force akin to those before it, and though after other fashion wrought will go through the same reflections. For it too persuades those who have once believed gladly to depart and remove from the worship according to the law, instructing that the shadow is our guide to the knowledge of Him, and that leaving the types and figures, we should go resolutely forward to <i>the Truth </i>Itself, i. e., Christ the Giver of true freedom and the Redeemer. <i>Ye shall know </i>therefore (He says) <i>the Truth, </i>if ye abide in My Words, and from knowing the Truth ye shall find the profit that is therefrom. Take then our Lord as saying some such thing as this to the Jews (for we ought I think to enlarge our meditation on what is now before us, for the <a name="p624"><span><font color="#000000">|624</font></span></a> profit's sake of the readers): A bitter bondage in Egypt, (He says) ye endured, and lengthened toil consumed you who had come into bitter serfdom under Pharaoh, but ye cried then to God, and ye have moved Him to mercy towards you, bewailing the misfortunes which were upon you ye were seeking a Redeemer from Heaven: forthwith I visited you even then, and brought you forth from a strange land, liberating you from most savage oppression I was inviting you unto freedom. But that ye might learn who is your aider and Redeemer, I was limning for you the mystery of Myself in the sacrifice of the sheep, and bidding it then to pre-figure the salvation through blood: for ye were saved by anointing both yourselves and the doorposts with the blood of the lamb. Hence by advancing a little forth from the types, when ye learn <i>the Truth, </i>ye shall be wholly and truly <i>free. </i>And let none (He says) doubt about this. For if the type was then to you the bestower of so great goods, how does not <i>the Truth </i>rather give you richer grace?</p><p>Nothing forbids us to suppose that such were what Jesus says to the Jews, if His Discourse run out to a wide range of thought: but it is probable that some other meaning also beams forth from what is before us. The Law through Moses typified washings and sprinklings, and moreover whosoever it befell to be caught and to fall into the pit of sin, him it bade to sacrifice a bullock or sheep and thus to abate the blame for each one's transgressions. But nought avail these things for the washing away of sin; for they will never liberate the condemned from blame, nor shew free from obligation of punishment those by whom the Divine Law has been trampled. For what will sacrifice of oxen profit a transgressor, what gain will any one find in sacrificing of sheep? For what will be pleasing from these, as far as pertains to transgression of the Law, to God who has been insulted? for hear Him saying, <i>Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? </i>and yet besides openly to the Jews, <i>Gather your whole burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh, for I spake not unto your fathers concerning whole burnt offerings or</i> <a name="p625"><span><font color="#000000">|625</font></span></a> <i>sacrifices, but this thing commanded I them saying, </i>Judge righteous judgment. Wholly profitless therefore is the approach through blood nor can it wash away the spot stained into the man through sin. You will have another proof when you see Him say to Jerusalem the mother of the Jews through the voice of Jeremiah, <i>Why wrought My beloved abominations in Mine House? shall prayers and holy flesh take away from thee thine evil or shall thou escape in these? For </i>it is <i>not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should talte away sins, </i>as Paul saith. But that they concerned about a fruitless worship, and zealous to perform the offerings through blood, or their gifts, to no useful end, were with reason sent away from the Divine court, He will teach again saying by the mouth of Isaiah, <i>Tread My courts no more: if ye offer fine flour, it is vain, incense is an abomination unto Me. </i>Not in these therefore (I mean the ordinances of the Law) is true salvation, nor yet will any one win hence the thrice-longed for freedom, I mean from sin. But bounding a little above the types, and surveying the beauty of the worship in Spirit and acknowledging <i>the Truth, </i>that is Christ, we are justified through faith in Him, and justified we pass over unto the true liberty, ranked no more among slaves as heretofore, but among the sons of God. And John will testify this, saying of Christ and of them that believe on Him, <i>But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to become children of God. </i>Profitably then doth our Lord and Christ not suffer them who believe on Him to marvel any more at the shadows of the law (for there is nought in them that profits or that bestows the true freedom) but bids them rather know <i>the Truth; </i>for through this does He say that they shall be entirely freed, according to the mind of the words.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>33    <i>We be Abraham's seed and have never been in bondage to any man, how sayest Thou, Ye shall be made free?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>They laugh at the promise of our Saviour, rather they even take it ill, as though they were insulted.    For that <a name="p626"><span><font color="#000000">|626</font></span></a> which has no share at all of <i>bondage, </i>how will it need (he says) of One Who calls us unto freedom, and Who gives us a something over and above what is in us already. But they know not, though wont to have a conceit of being wise,<i> </i>that their forefather <i>Abraham </i>was of no notable father after the world, nor yet of highest repute among those who are admired in this life, but was ennobled by faith only in God: <i>Abraham believed God, </i>it says, <i>and </i>faith <i>was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the Friend of God. </i>Thou seest then very clearly the cause of his illustriousness. For since he was called the friend of God who ruleth over all, he hath become on this account great and famed, and his faith was imputed to him for righteousness, and <i>the righteousness which is of faith </i>hath become to him the cause of freedom towards God <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#24" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">24</font></u></sup></a>, Therefore when he by believing was justified, that is, when he shook off the low birth that is from sin, then did he appear illustrious and of noble birth and free. Foolishly then do the Jews spurning the grace which freed the very founder of their race advance only to him who was freed thereby, but considering neither whence is or whither looks what is illustrious in him, they dishonour the Giver of what is most excellent in him, and forsaking the Fount of all nobility they think greatly of him who is participate thereof; but they will be caught vainly boasting of being never in bondage to any man and what they say about this will be no less proved to be false. For they were in bondage to the Egyptians for 430 years and through the grace that is from above were hardly delivered from the house of bondage and from <i>the iron furnace, </i>as it is written, to wit the tyranny of the Egyptians. And they were in bondage both to the Babylonians and Assyrians, when they removing the whole country of Judaea and Jerusalem itself transferred all Israel to their own land. In no respect then was the speech of the Jews sane: for besides being ignorant of their truer bondage, that in sin, they utterly <a name="p627"><span><font color="#000000">|627</font></span></a> deny the   other ignoble one and have an understanding accustomed to think highly about a mere nothing.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>34    <i>The Saviour answered them   Verily verily I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He lifts out of their innate unlearning these who were carnal and looking only to things corporal, He transfers them to the more spiritual and removes them to a mode of teaching wholly unpractised and unwonted, shewing them their hidden and through long ages unknown bondage; and that they falsely say, <i>To no man have we ever been</i>: <i>in bondage </i>He wisely passes by, neither does He say that to no purpose do they boast of the nobility of their forefather, in order that He may not appear to be inciting to what was not right them who were already prone and much inclined to anger, but advances to this needful matter and one which they needed verily to learn, that he is <i>sin's bondman </i>who doth it, as though He said thus: A compound animal, sirs, is man upon the earth, of soul that is and body, and bondage as to the flesh pertains to the flesh, but that of the soul and which takes place upon the soul, has for its mother, the barbarian, sin. The freedom then of man from bondage after the flesh the authority of the rulers will effect, but that which sets free from sin, is meet to be spoken of God Alone and will belong to none other save He. Therefore He persuades them to think reasonably and to desire real and true freedom, and thus to seek at length not the illustriousness of ancestors which nothing profits them thereto, but rather God Alone authoritative over His own Laws, the transgression whereof creates sin the foster mother of bondage to the soul. But our Lord Jesus Christ seems to be privily as yet and full veiledly convicting them of vainly thinking great things of a man and imagining that the blessed Abraham was altogether free. For His shewing generally that he who doeth <i>sin </i>is <i>the bondman of sin, </i>makes Abraham himself to have been once the bondman of sin and within its toils. For he was justified not as being himself righteous, but when he believed God then called to the freedom of being justified.    And <a name="p628"><span><font color="#000000">|628</font></span></a> not at all as quarrelling with the fame of the righteous man do we say this, but since none among men is without trial of the darts of sin, he too who is reputed great was surely brought under the yoke of sin as it is written, <i>There is none righteous, for all sinned and have come short of the glory of God. </i>But the glory of God besides other things is the being utterly incapable of falling into sin, which has been reserved for Christ Alone, for He Alone has been <i>free among the dead: </i>for He did no sin albeit being among the dead, that is reckoned among men over whom the death of sin once had mastery.</p><p>Therefore (for I will sum up the aim of what has been said) the Lord was hinting that the blessed Abraham himself too having been once in bondage to sin, and through faith alone to Christ-ward set free, availed not to pass on to others the spiritual nobility, since neither is he master of the power of freeing others who put away the bondage of sin not by himself nor was himself on himself the bestower of freedom, but received it from Another, Christ Himself Who justifieth.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>35    <i>The servant abideth not in the house for ever, the Son abideth ever.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having shewn that unfree and in bitter bondage is he who is subject to sin, He adds profitably both what will happen to him who hath loved bondage, and what again shall be their lot from God who have chosen to live after the Law and have therefore been ranked among the sons of God. For <i>the bondman, </i>He says, <i>abideth not in the house for ever </i>(for indeed and verily he shall go forth into the utter darkness there to pay the penalty of his enslaved life) but <i>the Son abideth ever. </i>For they who have once enjoyed the honour of adoption, shall abide in the presence of God, in no time thrust forth from the court of the firstborn, but rather passing a long and lasting season therein. And you will understand accurately what is said, if you bring forward and read the Gospel parable wherein Christ (it says) shall set <i>the goats on </i>the <i>left, the sheep on </i>the <i>right, </i><a name="p629"><span><font color="#000000">|629</font></span></a> and that He shall send away the goats saying, <i>Depart ye cursed into the everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: </i>and shall gather the sheep to Himself and receive them graciously, crying out, <i>Come ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. </i>For by <i>the goats </i>is meant the unfruitful multitude of them who love sin, by <i>the sheep, </i>the choir of the pious, laden<i> </i>with the fruit of righteousness, as though wool. Therefore he who beareth the disgrace of bondage shall be thrust forth of the kingdom of heaven like some useless and basest vessel: every one who loveth to live aright shall be received and shall abide therein, and be ranked therefore among the sons of God. And it seems likely that the Lord in saying these things hints also to them, that if they admit not the freedom that comes through faith, they shall surely depart forth of the holy and Divine court, that is, the Church, as is said by one of the Prophets, <i>I will drive them out of Mine House. </i>For that that which was afore spoken has reached its fulfilment, the very nature of things attests: for <i>the daughter of Zion was left as a tent in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, </i>as it is written: wholly fallen and destroyed is the temple, and themselves have gone forth <i>not </i>abiding therein <i>for ever </i>and in their place hath arisen and been raised up for Christ's sake the Church of the Gentiles, and they <i>abide </i>in it <i>ever </i>who have been called to Divine sonship through faith. For the boast of the Church will never cease nor ever fail, for the souls of the righteous depart from things of earth and are safely moored at the city that is above, the heavenly Jerusalem the church of the firstborn, <i>which is our mother, </i>according to the voice of Paul.</p><p>But since examining into what was said about bondage, and desiring every way to track out the truth, we have said that Abraham himself was numbered among bondmen, and not even him did we put outside the boundary of our contemplations, because of its being said more generally by Christ, <i>Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin: </i>come now let us following out our own words make clear the force of <a name="p630"><span><font color="#000000">|630</font></span></a> what has been said. The Jews were thinking great and excessive things, putting forward Abraham as a sort of head and fount of their nobility: but that it needed to seek to be freed through the grace that is from above, they admitted not even in bare thought, <i>fools and blind </i>according to the Saviour's voice.</p><p>Needs therefore does Christ design to shew that what is by nature bond, sufficeth not for the freedom of others nor yet one whit for its own, for how can that which lacks freedom as to its own nature, give freedom to itself, and that which borrows its own grace from another, how will it suffice for the supply of another? To Him Alone Who is by Nature God of God will befit and rightly be ascribed the power of freeing. Clear proof therefore gives He that all must needs be and be acknowledged bond that <i>abides not for ever, </i>i. e. to which belongs not being always the same. For every thing created will surely be also subject to corruption, and that which is so will be bondservant of God Who called it into being. For respecting the creatures it was said to Him, <i>For all </i>things are <i>Thy servants. </i>And this which is said is general, and one portion of the whole is the blessed Abraham, or again the whole human nature. But the abiding for ever gives a clear sign that the Only-Begotten God Who shines forth from God is King and Lord of all. For to whom will pertain the being always the same and being established in firm tenure of the everlasting good things, save to Him Who is by Nature God? in this way doth the Divine Psalmist too shew us that the creature is bond, God the Word which beamed of God the Father King and Lord. For extending the mental view<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>from a portion to the whole of creation, he says of the heavens and of Him Who is by Nature Son, <i>They shall perish but </i>THOU <i>abidest, and they all shall wax old like a garment and as a covering shalt Thou change them and they shall be changed, but </i>THOU <i>art the Same and Thy years shall not fail. </i>Seest thou how by this too exceeding well and true confessedly it is that the bond <i>abideth not for ever but the Son abideth </i>and that the non-abiding is a proof that that is <a name="p631"><span><font color="#000000">|631</font></span></a> bond of which it is predicated? And by analogy the other, i. e., the abiding for ever will be a clear token of His being Lord and God of whom such a word may be properly and truly said. Sufficient then were the Psalmist to testify to what we say, but since (as it is written), <i>In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established, </i>come let us besides him shew the blessed Jeremiah too thinking and saying consonantly. For he shewing that every thing that is made from its being corruptible is therefore bond, and shewing that the Son because He abides and is Unchangeable is by Nature God and manifestly therefore also Lord, says thus to Him, <i>For </i>THOU <i>endurest</i> <i>for ever and we perish for ever. </i>For at every time will the originate be corruptible by reason of its having been made, even though by the Power of God it decay not, and God will ever <i>sit, </i>what is here called sitting indicating the stability and unchanged fixedness of His Essence together with Its concentration and Its illustriousness in Royal Appearance and Reality, for sitting has an image of these.</p><p>Therefore (for I will go back to what I said at the beginning) from his not abiding for ever He shews that the blessed Abraham is corruptible and originate, for he has died and passed in a way out of the Lord's house, i. e. this world. By the same reasoning He would have us conceive of him as bond also and so not competent to bestow freedom upon others, and from the <i>Son </i>abiding <i>ever, </i>He says that He is clearly God of God by Nature, whereon will surely follow the being King and Lord. And what is the economy from the above mentioned distinction, shall be shewn in the next that in order follows.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>36    <i>If the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>To Him Alone (He says) Who is by Nature Son of a Truth free and remote from all bondage is found to pertain the power of freeing and to none other whatever save He. For as He because He is by Nature Wisdom and Light and Power, makes wise the things recipient of <a name="p632"><span><font color="#000000">|632</font></span></a> wisdom, enlightens those that lack light and strengthens those that want strength; so because He is God of God, and the Genuine and Free Fruit of the Essence That reigns over all, He bestows freedom on whomsoever He will. For no one can become truly free at his hands who has it not of nature. But when the Son Himself wills to free any, infusing His own Good, they are called <i>free indeed, </i>receiving the Dignity from Him who hath the Authority and not from any of those who have been lent it from Another and been ennobled with so to say foreign graces.</p><p>Most needful therefore is the preceding explanation, and great the profit which arises from that distinction to those who are zealous to hear it more diligently. For it was right to understand why it should be needful to seek for nobility towards God and to learn that the Son can make us free. Let them then who rejoice in the dignities of the world use themselves not to be swollen with lofty conceits nor let them run down the glory and grace of the saints, even though they should be little and spring of little after the flesh: for not the seeming to be illustrious among men suffices to nobility before God, but splendour in life and virtuous ways render a man <i>free indeed </i>and noble. <i>Joseph was sold for a bond-slave, </i>as it is written, but even so was he free, all radiant in the nobility of soul: Esau was born of a free father and was really free, but by the baseness of his ways he shewed a slave-befitting mind. Noble therefore before God, as we have just said, are not they who have riches and are flooded with superfluity of substance, and rejoice in the bright honours that are in the world, but they who are radiant with holy<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>life and an ordered conversation.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>37    <i>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye are seeking to kill Me because My word hath no place in you.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having manifoldly shewn them that the boast and conceit from their being of kin to Abraham is utterly empty and devoid of any good. He says this, that they may seek the nobility that is true and dear to God.    For God looks <a name="p633"><span><font color="#000000">|633</font></span></a> not on the flesh according to what is said by our Saviour Christ Himself, <i>The flesh profiteth nothing, </i>but rather accepts and accounts worthy of all praise nobility of soul and knows that they have true kinship, whom likeness of work or sameness of manners gathering unto one virtue, causes to be ennobled with equal forms of good and similarly the contrary. Since how are WE who are of earth and compacted <i>of clay, </i>as it is written, called kin of the Lord of all, as Paul saith, <i>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God? </i>For confessedly have we been made kin to Him, because of the Flesh That pertains to the Mystery of Christ. But it is possible in another way also to see this truly existing. For by thinking His Thoughts and resolving in no cursory manner to live piously, we are called sons of God who is over all, and forming our own mind after His Will so far as we can, thus are we to likeness with Him and most exact similitude truly kin.</p><p>But that God does take likeness and accurate similitude of works or of ways to have the force of kinship, we shall clearly know, if we look closely into the holy words, and explore the Holy Scripture. In the times therefore of Jeremiah the prophet, there was a certain false prophet, <i>Shemaiah the Nehelamite </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#25" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">25</font></u></sup></a> by name, belching things forth <i>of </i>his <i>own heart </i>as it is written and <i>not out of the Mouth of the Lord. </i>And since there was some other great multitude of lying witnesses and false prophets going about among the people, and drawing them away to what was not meet, God the Lord of all was at last rightly indignant. Then after having expended many words upon Shemaiah, and declared more in detail what penalties he should pay for his deed of daring, at last He adds, and <i>I will visit upon Shemaiah and his seed, </i>who do like deeds with him <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#26" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">26</font></u></sup></a>. Hearest thou how He sees kindred in like attempts? for how could He who judgeth right punish along with Shemaiah <a name="p634"><span><font color="#000000">|634</font></span></a> <i>his seed </i>after the flesh, not like-mannered with himself as regards baseness, albeit He says clearly by the Prophet Ezekiel, <i>The soul that sinneth, it shall die. </i>In order then that one may not imagine anything of this sort respecting him, having said, <i>his seed, </i>He immediately added, <i>Who do like deeds with him, </i>defining kindred to be in sameness of action. But that we may see that what is said is true of the very Jews, let us call to mind the words of John (I mean the holy Baptist), for shewing that rotten was their boast of kindred with Abraham, he says, <i>And say not within yourselves, We have Abraham for a father, for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up seed unto Abraham. </i>For since it had been said unto him by God, <i>Multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, </i>the people of the Jews resting upon the Promiser being surely and of necessity unlying, were thinking big, and expecting that in no wise could they fall from the kinship to their ancestor, that the Divine Promise may be kept. But the blessed Baptist annihilating this their hope, very clearly says, <i>God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham: </i>And with these falls in the blessed Paul too thus saying, <i>For not all they of Israel are these Israel, neither because they are the seed of Abraham </i>are they <i>all children. </i>It being shewn therefore on all sides to be true that God acknowledges kindred in manners and habits, clearly vain is it to boast of holy and good ancestors, and be left behind and depart far away from their virtue.</p><p>With reason therefore does the Lord say to the Jews, <i>I know that ye are Abraham's seed yet do ye seek to kill Me because My Word hath no place in you. </i>Yea (He says) when I look to the flesh alone and consider whence the people of the Jews sprang, then I see that ye are of the seed of Abraham, but when I look at the beauty of his conversation and disposition, I see that ye are aliens and no longer kin. For <i>ye are seeking to kill Me, </i>albeit your forefather, of whom ye now think great things, was no murderer, and worst and most lawless of all, on no just pretexts am I persecuted by you, but ye desire to kill Me in utter injustice: <a name="p635"><span><font color="#000000">|635</font></span></a> for for this reason alone did ye devise to destroy Me, <i>because My Word hath no place in you, </i>albeit calling you to salvation and life. It <i>hath no place in you, </i>because of the sin that indwelleth in you, and which suffereth not advice and counsel for good to have any room in you. Murderers therefore alike and most unrighteous judges are the Jews, determining that they ought to award to death Him who nothing wronged them but rather was engaged in doing<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>them good and zealous to save them. How then are they any longer kin to the righteous and good Abraham, who are so far behind the good that was in him, and have strayed so far from like conduct with him, as one would admit were distant and say were parted vice from virtue?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>38    I <i>speak that which I have seen with My Father, do </i>YE <i>then do that which ye heard </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#27" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">27</font></u></sup></a><sup><font size="3"> </font></sup> <i>from the </i><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#28" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">28</font></u></sup></a><i> Father.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Uncontained by the Jews did He say that His word was, and having said that this was the only reason why they were incited against Him, yea rather convicting them of desiring even to kill Him, needs does He add these things also, and why, I will set forth. He was not ignorant, it appears, that some of the Jews would rise up and dispute His words and belching forth from their innate madness, say again, Not for nothing (as Thou sayest) do some desire to slay Thee, for reasonable causes are they stimulated thereto, pious is their motion and their zeal free from all just accusal: for without place in them is Thy word seeing Thou madest it dissonant from God. Thou teachest us (he says) <i>another error </i>and drawest us off from the way of the Law, and removest us to that which pleases Thyself Alone. The Jews then whispering these things privately or imagining them in their hearts, the Lord again meets them, knowing the motions of their imaginations within (for He is Very God) and therefore says, I <i>speak that which I have seen with My Father, </i>I beheld close the Nature of Father, I saw ofttimes of Myself and in Myself Him Who <a name="p636"><span><font color="#000000">|636</font></span></a> begat Me, and am a Beholder of the Will That is in Him. I saw, by innate knowledge that is, of what works He is the Lover, and these <i>I speak </i>to you, I shall not be found to say ought dissonant to Him, nor have I appointed any thing other than pleases Him. To that was I earnest in calling My hearers, not departing from what is Mine (for in Me are His, and Mine again in Him) but if I Who am thus by Nature and am in all things Co-willer with God the Father, appear to you to be not true and I am adjudged to be leading you astray from the Divine Teachings, let the charge be dismissed, cast away suspicion; <i>do that which ye heard from the Father, </i>He hath spoken to you by Moses, accomplish the command, ye heard Him say, <i>The innocent and righteous slay thou not, </i>how then <i>are ye seeking to kill Me </i>and breaking the Father's commandment?</p><p>But in another way again will we take the words, <i>Do </i>YE <i>then do that which ye heard from the Father. </i>He has spoken to you (He says) through the Prophets, ye heard Him say, <i>Rejoice greatly o daughter of Zion, shout o daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy King cometh unto thee, He </i>is <i>just and having salvation and mounted upon a colt the foal of an ass, </i>and again through the voice of Isaiah, <i>O Zion that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain, o Jerusalem that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength, lift ye up, be not afraid, behold your God, behold the Lord cometh with strength and His Arm with rule</i>, <i>behold His Reward with Him and His work before Him: like a shepherd shall He feed His flock, He shall gather the lambs with His Arm and shall comfort those that are with young. </i>Obeying therefore the commands of the Father, receive Him Who is fore-announced to you; honour with faith Him Who has been fore-preached. Give at least to the words of the Father to prevail in you.</p><p>But we must know that He saya that the Law is God the Father's, albeit spoken by Him through Angels <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_05_book5.htm#29" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">29</font></u></sup></a>, not <a name="p637"><span><font color="#000000">|637</font></span></a> putting Himself outside of the law-giving, but He yielding to the surmises of the Jews who believed that it was so, and economically, does not oppose Himself to their surmise, for ofttimes doth He shame them, since they receive Him not, for He brings before them the Father's Name.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>39    <i>They answered and said unto Him, Our father is Abraham.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>O great unlearning and mind withered unto unbelief and looking to only wrangling! For while our Saviour Christ consenteth and saith openly, <i>I know that ye are Abraham's seed, </i>they persist in the same, and as though one were holding out and contradicting and saying that they were not of Abraham's seed after the flesh, they again say, <i>Our father is Abraham, </i>and blush not going oft through the same words, who think that they ought not to yield even to Battus <sup><font size="3">i</font></sup>, but are but most excellent emulators of that man's babbling. But perchance they had some most unreasoning plea for this, and what, we will tell. For when the Lord says, I <i>speak that which I have seen with My Father, </i>they did not imagine that He hereby intended God the Father, but thought that He spoke of either the righteous Joseph, or some other of those on the earth, ridiculing and deeming and thinking exceeding little things of Him. For the holy Virgin conceived in her womb the Divine Babe, not of marriage but <i>of the Holy Ghost, </i>as it is written. And the blessed Joseph knowing not at first the mode of the economy <i>was minded to put her away privily, </i>as Matthew saith. But it was not by any means unknown by the Jews that the holy Virgin conceived in her womb before marriage and coming together, yet they understood not that it was of the Holy Ghost, but thought that she had been corrupted by one of the nation, whence they had no right conceptions of Christ. For they deemed that He was a child begotten of some other father who had corrupted (according to their <a name="p638"><span><font color="#000000">|638</font></span></a> madness) the holy Virgin, and that He was attributed only to Joseph, being a bastard and not son in truth. When then He says, I <i>speak that which I have seen of My Father, </i>they took in no thought at all of God, but that He meant some one of earthly fathers and fancied that He was trying to move them from their honour to their ancestor, and suspecting that He was apportioning to His own kin the honour due to another, and that most ancient glory of the Patriarchate, they meet Him in a more contentious and vehement manner saying, <i>Our father is Abraham. </i>For just as though they were saying, Albeit, sir, you drench us with clever words, and din around us with portentous marvels, and strike us hard with mighty deeds beyond speech, you will not remove us from our pristine boast, we will not register Thy father as the head of our race, we will not attribute such a glory to another, nor will we take new ancestors in exchange for the elder ones. It is no marvel, nor hard to believe, that the Jews should fall into such folly, when they imagined that He is even a bare man and in manifold wise holding Him cheap would call Him <i>the carpenter's son </i>and rank as though nought the King and Lord of all.</p><p>But that they had no right opinion as to the holy Virgin also, as though she had been denied, we shall know full well by what follows.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>40  <i>Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham; but now ye seek to kill Me, a Man That have told you the truth which I heard of God, this did not Abraham.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Soothing, so to say, by every way and word the boldness of the Jews, Christ speaks to them veiledly, not applying open conviction but mingled with gentle speech, and in lowly wise and manifoldly charming their wrath. For since He sees that they are most exceeding silly and understand nought of what is said, He makes His Discourse free at length from any veil and bared of all covering. For it needed (He says) it needed, if ye believed that being classed <a name="p639"><span><font color="#000000">|639</font></span></a> among <i>Abraham's children </i>was the highest honour, that ye should be zealous to imitate his manners: it needed that ye should track the lovely virtue of your ancestor, it needed that ye should be zealous of and love his obedience. For he heard God say, <i>Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land that I will shew thee. </i>And nought delaying in the fulfilment of what was bidden him, he hastens forthwith from his country, and relying on the mercy of Him who bade him, arrives in a foreign land. And being at the very goal so to speak of life and passing his hundredth year, he heard, Thou shalt have a seed, and nothing doubting, he gave fervent faith to Him That spake, heeding not the weakness of his flesh, but looking at the Strength of Him That spoke to him. He heard that he was to offer to God his beloved for a sacrifice and forthwith he strove against the longings of nature, and made his love for the youth second to the Divine Command. In you I find all contrary to these, for <i>ye are seeking, </i>He says, <i>to kill Me because I have told you </i>things <i>from God, this did not Abraham. </i>For he insulted not by his unbelief Him who spake to him, he sought not to do any thing that grieved Him. How then are ye any more <i>Abraham's children </i>being as far distant from his piety as the difference of your actions shews?</p><p>But observe how He arranges His speech: for He said not that they heard <i>the truth </i>from the Father but <i>from God, </i>since, as we just now said, from their innate unbounded folly they were dragged down to untrue conceptions of Him, thinking that He was speaking of some one of earthly fathers. And exceeding well does He making His Discourse about dying call Himself <i>Man, </i>in every way retaining to Himself incorruptibility as God by Nature yet not severing from Himself His own Temple, but as being One Son, even when He became Man, yet says that He spake <i>the Truth. </i>For not in types any more and figures does the Saviour's word teach us to practise piety, but persuades us to love the spiritual and true worship.</p><p>But when He says, <i>Which I heard from the Father, we </i>must by no means be offended.    For since He says that <a name="p640"><span><font color="#000000">|640</font></span></a> He is Man, He speaks this too as befits man: for as He is said as Man to die, let Him be said as Man to hear also. But it seems likely that in the word, <i>heard, </i>He puts the inherent knowledge which He has of the will of His own Progenitor, for so is the wont of the Divinely inspired Scripture oftentimes to say of God. For when it says And the Lord heard, we do not by any means attribute to Him a separate and distinct sense of hearing, like as there is in us, for the Divine Nature is simple and remote from all compound, but we take rather hearing as knowledge and knowledge as hearing; for in the simple there is nought compound as we have said.</p><p>And to these meanings we will add a third, not departing from fit aim. God the Father said somewhere of Christ to the most holy Moses, <i>A Prophet will I raise them up </i>(i. e. to them of Israel) <i>from among their brethren like unto thee and I will put My words in His Mouth and He shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him. </i>For this reason therefore did our Lord Jesus Christ say that He heard <i>from the </i>Father <i>the Truth </i>and spake it to the Jews, at once convicting them of fighting against God the Father and shewing clearly that Himself is He whom the Lawgiver promised before to raise up to them.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>41    YE <i>do the deeds of your father.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Having shewn that the Jews are utterly of other manner than their ancestor, and far removed from his piety, He with good reason strips them of their empty fleshly boast. And saying openly that they ought not any longer to be enrolled among his children, He allots them to another father like unto them, and affixed similitude of deeds as a sort of bond of kindred, teaching that the good ought to be joined to the good, and deciding that it is meet that they who live ill should have as fathers those who have been condemned for the like. For like as they who have chosen to live excellently, and are therefore even now called saints, may without hazard call God their Father, so to the wicked is the wicked one rightly ascribed as father, seeing that they form the image of his wickedness and perversity <a name="p641"><span><font color="#000000">|641</font></span></a> in their characters. For not altogether is he who begot of himself conceived of as father by the Divine Scripture, but he too who has any conformed to his own character, of whom he is said to be therefore father. Thus does the Divine Paul too write to certain, <i>for in Christ Jesus through the Gospel did </i>I <i>beget you. </i>As then (as we said) some are conformed both to God and to the holy fathers through likeness in manners and holiness; so to the devil too and to those like in conduct to him are some rendered like-minded, suffering this through their own depravity. Therefore to the saints the saints are fathers, but to the wicked the wicked who betake themselves to them, most befittingly. And the one, who in holiness take the impression  (so to say) of the Divine Form on their own souls, and have the confidence that befits own sons, will with reason say <i>Our Father which art in heaven</i>: the bad again will be ascribed to their own father, begotten as it were through likeness unto him unto equal depravity with him. To the Jews therefore Christ allots and names another father than the holy Abraham, and who, He does not as yet clearly say.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They said therefore to Him, We have not been born of fornication, we have one Father, God.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Already now have I said that the all-daring Jews were easily sick with bitter and unholy conceptions of our Saviour Christ. For they thought that the holy Virgin had been corrupted, I mean the Lord's Mother, and that she was taken with child, not of the Holy Ghost or of operation from above but of one of those on the earth. For being wholly disbelieving and without understanding, they either made no account of the prophetic writings, albeit openly hearing, <i>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, </i>or looking only to the flesh and following the order of events usual with us, and not thinking of the Nature which works beyond speech, to which nought is hard to perform, every thing that seems good to Him easy; they deem that no otherwise could a woman conceive in her <a name="p642"><span><font color="#000000">|642</font></span></a> womb, save by coming together with her husband and cohabitation. Sick of such a suspicion, the wretched ones dared to accuse the Birth through the Spirit of the Divine and wondrous Offspring. But when putting them forth from kindred with Abraham He allots them to another father, very angry are they, and unrestrainedly foaming up their inherent anger, they reviling say, WE <i>have not been born of fornication, we have one Father, God. </i>For they say darkly somewhat of this sort, Two fathers hast Thou, neither wert Thou born of honourable marriage, WE <i>One, God.</i></p><p>But let a man see and consider clearly how great their disease of madness in this too. For they who by reason of the naughtiness and depravity that was in them are by the Righteous Judge put not even among the children of Abraham, advance to such a measure of madness, as to call even <i>God </i>their <i>Father, </i>perhaps because of what is said in the books of Moses, <i>Israel </i>is <i>My son, My first-born, </i>not admitting into their mind what is said through the voice of Isaiah, <i>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord.</i></p><p>And one may reasonably enquire what it was that induced the Jews at present to say no longer, Our father is Abraham, or, We have one father Abraham, but to go straight up to <i>One God. </i>To me they seem to have had some thought of this kind. For when they, smiting with their railing the Lord, as though His mother had been dishonoured before marriage, were ascribing to Him two fathers, needs did they seek to take the title of one as an ally of their own ill-will. For whereby they affirm that they have <i>One Father God, </i>by the same they indirectly reproach the Lord of having two, setting the <i>One </i>over against two. For they imagined that if they said, We have one father Abraham, they would be altogether denying the rest, I mean Isaac and Jacob, and the twelve who were from him, which if they should do, they would seem to be arming themselves against themselves and to fight with their own choice and boast, estranging Israel from the nobility of the fathers, and thereby to go along with the Lord's own saying. Escaping then the damage that thence seemed to accrue to them, they no <a name="p643"><span><font color="#000000">|643</font></span></a> longer say, We have one father Abraham, but rather ascribe to themselves <i>One Father God, </i>spell-subdued by only the most unsure pleasures of railing, that they might fall into yet greater blame, craftsmen of all impiety, yet daring to take as their father the Enemy of all impiety.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>42    <i>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father ye would love Me, for </i>I <i>proceeded forth from God and am come.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The Lord does not hereby take away the power of any to be ranked among the sons of God, but shews rather to whom will pertain the boast of it, and that it will be found rather in the saints, and convicts the insulting Jew of being mad. For <i>I </i>(saith He) am sprung the One and True Son by Nature, from God the Father that is; and all are adopted, formed after Me and mounting up unto My Glory, for images are always after their archetypes. How can ye then (He says) at all be numbered among the children of God, who are minded not only not to <i>love </i>Him Who beamed forth from God and transfashions unto His own Form those who believe on Him, but do even dishonour Him, not in one way but in many? and they who receive not the Image of God the Father, how will they be at all formed after Him? Besides it is lawful (He says) not to any chance persons without blame to call God their Father, but those in whom the beauty of piety towards Him shall flash forth,----those I deem and none other will it befit. <i>I </i>have come from Heaven to counsel you things most excellent, and My Word invites you to the being formed after God. But if it be verily your aim and longing to have God as your Father, surely ye would have loved Me your Guide and Teacher on such a path, Who give you the opportunity of likeness to the One and True Son, Who through the Holy Ghost render conformed to Himself those who receive Him. For he (He says) who altogether boasteth of ownness toward God, how would he not love Him That is of God? how (tell me) will he honour the tree who foolishly loatheth the fruit that is its offspring? <i>Either </i>therefore, He saith, <i>make the tree good and his fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt. </i>If therefore the Tree (i. e. God the <a name="p644"><span><font color="#000000">|644</font></span></a> Father) be Noble and ye know how to draw the Splendour thereof on your own heads, why loved ye not the Fruit that is of Him, believing It to be such as He is? The verse before us therefore hath at once a bitter reproof of the Jews (for it shews them to be liars, for when they essay to call God their Father, they are far away from the virtue that pertains to those who are called to this, because they love not Him Who is of God by Nature) and at the same time it profitably brings in the mention of His own Ineffable Generation, that they might be caught in impiety in this too, calling Him ill-born and bastard. For if the saying, I <i>proceeded forth from God, </i>signifies His Ineffable and Eternal Generation from the Father<i>; </i>adding I am come, [He shews] His appearance in this world with Flesh. And surely one will not say that God the Word then first beamed forth from God the Father, when He became Man (for so it seemed to some of the unholy heretics) but he will rather take it as is meet and will conceive of it piously. For not because He joined the words, (I mean <i>I proceeded forth </i>and <i>I am come) </i>will the Word of the Father be co-eval in time with the Birth of the Flesh, but to each of the things indicated will we keep its proper meaning. For we believe the first Generation of the Word conceived of as from God to be without beginning and above mind; wherefore it hath been set forth first in the words, I <i>proceeded forth from God; </i>the second, i. e., that after the Flesh, <i>for neither have I come of Myself but He sent Me. </i>I was Incarnate as you, that is, I became Man, in the Good Pleasure of God the Father came I in this world to declare to you the things of God and to tell to those who know not, what it is that pleases Him. But ye loved not (He says) Him Who from the Divine counsel was revealed to you as Saviour and Guide. How then will ye any more be called children of God, or how will ye gain the grace of ownness with Him, if ye honour not Him That is of Him? It is likely that the Lord again means something by this and aims by such words also to silence the people of the Jews who are vainly yelping at Him. And what it is that is intended we will briefly say. <a name="p645"><span><font color="#000000">|645</font></span></a> </p><p>Many among the Jews esteeming no whit the Divine Fear, but admiring and accepting only honours from men, and overcome by base lucre, dared to prophesy, speaking out <i>of their own heart and not out of the Mouth of the Lord, </i>as it is written. And verily the Lord of all Himself chid them saying, <i>I sent not the prophets, I spake not to them yet they prophesied; </i>yea, He threatened to do dread things to them crying out, <i>Woe unto them that prophesy out of their their own heart and see nothing at all. </i>Such an one was that <i>Shemaiah </i>who to the words of Jeremiah opposed his own lie and having taken the yokes of wood and shattered them, said, <i>Thus saith the Lord, I will shatter the yoke of the king of Babylon. </i>Since then when our Saviour Christ says, <i>But now ye seek to kill Me a man who have told you the truth which I heard of God, </i>the Jews began to murmur, and not knowing Who He is in truth, to imagine that He is some false prophet and to be therefore hardened, so as to even dare to revile Him, and so angrily desire to kill Him as even to press on to do it:----profitably does He again terrify them, saying that He <i>came </i>not <i>of </i>Himself as was the wont of them who prophesy falsely, but was <i>sent </i>by God, that by the same He both putting aside the reputation of being a false prophet and teaching that they will incur no slight doom, who not only dishonour Him that has been sent by God the Father, but also dare to devise murder against Him, might cut short their unbridled daring.</p><p>This then for what is before us. But it is probable that the heretic will make what has been said the food of his innate impiety. He will haply accuse the Essence of the Only-Begotten and will deem that it is in lower case than the Father's because of His saying that He had been sent by Him. But let such an one consider the mode of the economy but now spoken, and remember Paul crying aloud of the Son, <i>Who being in the Form of God thought it not robbery to be Equal with God, but emptied Himself taking servant's form, made in the likeness of men and found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself made obedient unto death.    </i>But if He hath of His own will humbled <a name="p646"><span><font color="#000000">|646</font></span></a> Himself, the Father, that is, consenting and Co-willing it, what accusal will He have, going through the whole mode of the Economy unto its consummation, in any reasonable way? But if because of His saying that He has been sent, you deem that the Son lies in lower case than the Father, how (tell me) doth He That is in lower case, according to thy unlearning, work in all exactitude the things of God? For where does the lesser shew itself in Him who possesses perfectly all that belongs to His own Progenitor and the fullest God-befitting Authority? Therefore He will not be conceived of as less on account of being sent, but being God of God by Nature and verily, since Himself is the Wisdom and Power of the Father, He is sent to us as from the sun the light which is spread abroad from it, in order that He might make wise that which lacks wisdom, and that thus at length that which was weak might be lifted up through Him and strengthened unto the knowledge of God the Father and recovered unto all virtue. For all things most fair beamed on the human race through only Christ. There is therefore nothing at all of servile kind in Christ, but it belongs only to the form of the flesh: but God-befitting is His Authority and Power even all, even though the language meetly conformed to the measure of lowliness take human fashion.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>43    <i>Why do ye not understand My speech? because ye cannot hear My word.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><div>What we have oftentimes said we say again for profit to the readers: for there is no harm in our discourse going very frequently through what may profit. It is the custom then of our Saviour Christ not altogether to accept from those who disbelieve Him, the word that boiled up from their tongue, but to look rather on the hearts and reins, and to make His replies to the thoughts that were yet revolving in the depth of their hearts. For man who knows not the thoughts that are in another, will needs admit the uttered word, but God not so; for He knowing all things, takes the thought for the voice.   When then the Lord said <a name="p647"><span><font color="#000000">|647</font></span></a> to the Jews that He had come not of Himself, like them who of their own mind and not of the Divine Spirit advance to prophesy, but that He was sent by God, they again imagine, or reason among themselves, or secretly whispering one to another said, Many Prophets have spoken the things of God and brought words from the Spirit unto us, but we find nought among them of such sort as is in this man's words. For He bears us wholly away from the worship after the Law and removes us to some other polity and introduces to us a strange transition<i> </i>of life. Dissonant therefore manifestly and irreconcileable is His Discourse with that of those of old. Since He beheld them thinking (as is likely) these things, shewing that He is by Nature God and knoweth the counsels of the hearts, He takes hold of it and says, <i>Why do ye not understand My Speech? because ye cannot hear My Word. </i>I am not ignorant (He says) that <i>ye cannot </i>comprehend <i>My Speech, </i>or doctrine; but I will tell you the reason and will clearly set before you what is the hindrance. <i>Ye cannot hear My Word. </i>He says, <i>ye cannot, </i>convicting them of impotence unto perfect good, because of their being fore-mastered by their passions. For the love of pleasure unnerves the mind, and the unbridled tendency towards evil yet weakening the sinew of the heart, renders it feeble and most spiritless to the power of performing any virtue. Being therefore fore-weakened by tendencies to vice and tyrannized by your own passions <i>ye cannot, </i>He says, <i>hear My Word. For right </i>are <i>the ways of the Lord, </i>as it is written, <i>and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressors shall become impotent in them. </i>Akin to this will you find that too which was in another place said to the Pharisees, <i>How can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that, </i>cometh <i>from the only God? </i>for verily in this their not being able to believe shews the voluntary weakness of their understanding or that their mind has been before overcome of vainglory. And we find again that that is true of the Jews which has been spoken by the voice of Paul, <i>But the natural</i> <i>man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</i> <a name="p648"><span><font color="#000000">|648</font></span></a> <i>for they are foolishness to him. </i>Since therefore they were <i>natural</i>, they deemed that He was foolishness Who was inviting them to be saved, and was teaching them the path of an excellent conversation, and directing them full well unto the power of pleasing God who delighteth in virtue, to whom be all honour, glory, might, for ever and ever.  Amen.</div><div><br /></div><div><p>44 Ye <i>are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him.</i></p><p>Having with reason led them off from their kindred with Abraham and convicted them of having unlikeness to him in their manners, and of being far removed from piety toward God Himself, and yet moreover having explained the reason of their not being able to be obedient to His speech, He again shews who will rather be more fittingly and properly termed their father. Ye therefore, He says, <i>are of your father the devil, </i>whom He says was also <i>a murderer </i>in <i>the beginning </i>and that he <i>abides not in the truth </i>and <i>is a liar; </i>and that his <i>father </i>was a liar, whom in what follows He defined clearly who he is : for the mighty force<i> </i>itself in their brevity of the words before us has much obscurity and specially needs accurate scrutiny. For deep is the discourse about this, and not clear I ween to the many. For as to the meaning which can readily be got, it allots <a name="p651"><span><font color="#000000">|651</font></span></a> to the Jews no other father than Satan who fell from heaven. But that which is put next about the father allotted them, that <i>he is a liar just as his father also, </i>troubles us, yea rather compels us to fresh doubt<sup><font size="3">2</font></sup> not a little. For whom (if we think reasonably) can we imagine to have been father to the devil, or what other before him fell to whom he that comes after can be compared in likeness and manner ? for no one will shew us such a reading as this in the holy and Divine Scriptures; and in no wise is that to be received as truth which is not told in the Divinely-inspired Scriptures. For every spirit that is reckoned among devils as a child of the devil is called Satan according to what is said by our Saviour Christ, <i>If </i>then <i>Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: </i>yet have we heard of one surpassing the rest and above them, him to whom it is somewhere said by the Prophet Ezekiel, Thou <i>art the seal of likeness and crown of beauty begotten in the delight of the Paradise of God, every precious stone hast: thou put on. </i>Whom else then shall we unblamed suppose existed, after whom this one was formed, in likeness I mean as to vice? for some of the elder expositors, citing what is now before us, say that that ancient Satan who is conceived of as being the chief of all the other devils was bound by the Might of God and cast into Tartarus itself there to pay the penalty of what he had done in outrage against God, and that some other appeared after him, coming nothing short of the abominations of his father <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#1" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">1</font></u></sup></a>, and they affirmed that of him it was that the Saviour says that <i>he was a murderer from the beginning and that he is a liar, as his father.</i></p><p>But unless we had much considered it in our minds, we should with reason have readily accepted this, but now this one thing above all suffers us not to approve inconsiderately. For at the time of the Saviour's Advent, the tyranny of the devil was receiving the beginning of its fall and the wicked and unclean spirits were being sent <a name="p652"><span><font color="#000000">|652</font></span></a> forth into the deep. And verily the devils would come and openly beg Him, <i>that He would not command them to go forth into the deep. </i>And we remember that they made a great outcry about this, saying, <i>Let us alone, what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth? we know Thee Who Thou art, The Holy One of God, art Thou come hither to torment us before the time? </i>For that our Lord Jesus Christ having come among us would waste them away<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>and manifoldly vex them, they themselves too knew full well, finding much talk of Him among those in Israel, yet found fault as though He had come not in His season, in this too acting tyrannically and perversely accusing the time of the Advent. But they say <i>before the time, </i>as though in no wise tormented in any other time, but looking for one, the time of the Advent, in which they were unquestionably to undergo what they are expecting. And to this we say besides, If, he being bound according to their distinction, some other deceived Adam, and does not yet cease from the madness whereof he is accused, the first one will be wholly blameless as regards us, and this account will free him from all blame, and neither hath he slain any, nor deceived nor lied, nor yet will it be justly said to him by God, <i>As raiment stained in blood shall not be clean, so neither shalt </i>thou <i>be clean, because thou destroyedst My land and slewest My people. </i>If therefore we grant that that he whom they say is the first is wholly without any share in the above enumerated evil deeds, whom shall we decide that the second after him imitated, or after whom was he formed who surpassed in wickedness his leader, and had the deeper impress of that one's villainy?</p><p>And it were I suppose not unreasonable that we searching out this matter should go through fuller proofs, but we think it superfluous to put forth too much energy for what needs not: we will therefore go on to another thought and accurately search who it was that Christ allotted to the Jews as their father of like manner and disposition, so that for his father might  reasonably be enrolled an evil <a name="p653"><span><font color="#000000">|653</font></span></a> spirit, that prince of evil, i. e. Satan. He brings them up therefore to Cain who first of all men loved not Him who chastised him by reproofs, but was set forth as the beginning of envy and murder and craft and lying and deceit, next to that Satan whose son he is rightly said to be, inasmuch as he receives in himself the whole impress of that one's wickedness. For as God is the Father of every holy and righteous person, being Himself the beginning of the holiness and righteousness of all:----in the same way I deem will Satan be reasonably styled father of every wicked person, himself being the author of all wickedness. But since we have said that Cain was given to the Jews as their father, to Cain again Satan, come let us following out our own words clearly shew that Satan first of all reared his neck at God's reproofs, then both deceived and lied and lastly through envy committed murder: and having shewn that Cain was of like manner and disposition with him, we in the third place bring down our argument to the Jews who possess complete the image of the wickedness that is in him.</p><p>Satan therefore despising <i>his own principality </i>and greatly longing after what was above his own nature, and not keeping the limit of his position, was borne down and fell, thereby convicted by God and taught the measure of his nature. But nothing profited thereby by reason of his ill counsel, he sickened of a worse disease, by no means looking to the duty of amending his own disposition, but minded to abide in steadfast perversity. But when the first man was formed by God, according to the book of Moses, and was in Paradise, yet keeping the commandment given him, that I mean about the Tree, Satan was first kindled to envy, and in that his transgression and disobedience were blamed by the first-created, while they were as yet keeping the commandment given them, he was eager by much-intriguing deceits to draw them away unto disobedience.    And knowing that they would waste away if <a name="p654"><span><font color="#000000">|654</font></span></a> they made light of the commands of the Great King, he persuades them to do this, encompassing with the uttermost ills those who had nothing injured him. For that a deed of devilish deceit and envy was the transgression in Adam and the death that through it sprang upon him, the very nature of the thing will itself teach us, and the saying of the all-wise Solomon will make clear to us speaking on this wise, <i>God made not death, but through envy of the devil came death into the world.</i></p><p>Herein then is his part, let now Cain come in to us and stand before us. For he was the first-born of Adam, an husbandman by occupation, and next after him came Abel, but he was a shepherd of sheep. But since the law of nature called them to offer sacrifice to God, implanting untaught the knowledge of the Creator (for all good things have been sown and infused in our nature by God): Cain offered <i>of the fruit of the ground, </i>as it is written, but Abel, <i>he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof; and God had respect unto Abel and to his gifts but unto Cain and to his offerings He had not respect. And Cain was very vexed and his countenance fell. And the Lord God said unto Cain, Why wert thou vexed and why did thy countenance fall? If thou offeredst well but dividedst not aright, didst thou not sin? be still. </i>Then to Abel, <i>Unto thee shall be his resort and </i>thou <i>shalt rule over him. </i>Therefore Cain was blamed for dividing not aright his offering, Abel was rightly deemed worthy of praise and honour, which was to Cain food of envy. For he was exasperated at the correcting reproofs, just as Satan was, then swelling with unrighteous envy, as we said, he goes after his brother in guile, already devising the unholy murder. For, it says, <i>Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go over unto another field better than this, </i>and inviting as though to enjoyment and tender grass him who was utterly unconscious, he savagely murdered him, and first of all laid him dead on the ground, thinking (it seems) that he would surely win all wonder, having no longer any to surpass him.   And having slain him, he told a lie; for when <a name="p655"><span><font color="#000000">|655</font></span></a> God says. <i>Where </i>is <i>Abel thy brother?</i> he says, <i>I know not, </i>and out of his exceeding folly added in heat, <i>Am </i>I <i>my brother's keeper? </i>For it says that he well-nigh said thus, Thou who crownedst him unjustly what good didst Thou, his Keeper, do him? Thou seest then and that clearly that the whole likeness of the devil's wickedness was accurately finished in him, and the conformation of his manners moulded after an equal and like fashion.</p><p>Let our discourse therefore go forward to the impiety of the Jews, and putting around them the likeness of Cain's villainy, let us shew that they essayed those things against Christ, which he did against Abel, that rightly and fitly he may be termed their father. Therefore first-born was Cain, as we have said, first-born again among the children of God by adoption was Israel, as was said to Moses, <i>Israel </i>is <i>My first-born. </i>And he hath brought of the produce of the ground an offering unto God, but <i>to his offerings He had not respect, </i>as it is written. For more earthly was Israel's worship of the law, as has been said, by bullocks and sheep and fruits of the earth, nor does God accept this. For <i>to what purpose, </i>He saith, <i>cometh there to Me incense from Sheba and cinnamon from a far country? </i>and by the voice of Isaiah too He openly crieth, <i>Who required this at your hand? </i>After Cain cometh the righteous Abel to sacrifice of the sheep. For after the service according to the law, and at the consummation of the Prophets came Christ the verily Righteous, bringing not fruits of the earth for a sacrifice to God the Father, but for the life and salvation of all offering to Him Himself as an immaculate Victim for an odour of a sweet smell. For God the Father dismissing as more earthly the worship after the Law, had respect to the sacrifice of our Saviour Christ. The word, <i>had respect to </i>means Delighted in. What followed? Cain was rebuked for not dividing aright, and when blamed was sick of envy, and hastens headstrong unto murder. And God was admonishing in His Son the people of the Jews, was asking of them better things for offering, bidding them transform the worship according to the Law unto spiritual fruit-bearing, and <a name="p656"><span><font color="#000000">|656</font></span></a> urging them to transfashion the Letter unto truth: but they reproved are angry, and are smitten with the paternal envy, and unrighteously plot murder against our Saviour Christ. Cain deceived Abel, and taking him into the field displayed him dead: the Jews likewise as far as in them lay deceived Christ, sending the traitor in the guise of a friend, who coming to Him to betray Him saluted Him deceitfully saying, <i>Hail Master. </i>And they too took Him into the plain, i. e., they destroyed Him without the gate. For <i>without the gate </i>did Christ suffer because of us and for us. Thou seest then how they are found to be in no way like Abraham or those who were really of him, but bear the image of their own fitly and really belonging father, and madly sick with wickedness conformed and akin to his, they rightly hear, ye <i>are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do; he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in, him; when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar just as was his father. And </i>I, <i>because I tell you the truth, ye believe Me not. </i>The aim of the discourse looks to the father of the Jews who was brought forward and exhibited, I mean Cain, but it spreads out more generally. For not at that man's life does He bound the force of what He says, but puts it round about every one who is like him, allotting what is said of one individually to every one who is like him. For when (He says) Cain or other liar like him utters <i>a lie, </i>he utters it as of his own kin. For learning what he has from his rulers and him who hath given him the beginning of wickedness, he making the lie his own as some natural acquisition imitates his own father, for he utters a lie. Wherefore (He saith) since he had for his father one who delighted in lies, he is led on as by natural laws to the ignobility of his grandfather and father and shews forth in himself their villainy, and making the depravity of his ancestors the very clearest image of his own manners and ways, surely brags of his own ill.</p><p>Since then this is even so and the wickedness of elders engraven on those of like manners with themselves, causes <a name="p657"><span><font color="#000000">|657</font></span></a> them to be styled their children, what is it that hinders you from believing <i>Me </i>even when <i>I tell </i>you <i>the truth, </i>that I of a surety am sprung of a True Father, and (as I said before) <i>I proceeded forth from God and am come? </i>For if a person tells lies because he has a liar for his father and utters them thence as from his own kindred, how is it not of necessity that I too speaking the truth must be conceived to have been surely begotten of a True Father and not (as YE blasphemously surmised) from one of the earth who was of fornication and unlawful union?</p><p>Such words then will the Lord have used to the Jews. But we must know that in respect of men or of rational spirits in manners and habits is seen the kinness which they may have one to another [and] to the father of all wickedness the devil: in regard of the Only-Begotten this is taken only as an image of this which is before us <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#2" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">2</font></u></sup></a>: for by Him it [i. e., the relationship] is full exactly limned, for His Connaturalness with the Father is Natural and Essential. For being of Him in truth, possessing all that is His with Natural Property and the acme of likeness in ail things, He is seen the Form and Image and Impress of Him Who begat Him. Since therefore the Father is True, Truth of a surety is He too That is of Him, i. e., the Christ. </p><blockquote><blockquote><p>46 <i>Which of you convinceth Me of sin?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The question is not that of one who looketh to be convicted, but rather of One Who takes away and utterly denies the possibility of Very God Who beamed forth of God, falling into sin: for Christ did no sin. For all sin takes its rise from the turning aside from the better unto that which is not so, and is produced in those whose nature it is to turn and who are recipient of change unto what they ought not. For how will he be conceived to even sin who knows no turning nor is recipient of change to ought that is not <a name="p658"><span><font color="#000000">|658</font></span></a> convenient, but rather is steadfast in His own innate Good, and that not from another but from Himself? The Lord then enquires of the Jews if they can at all <i>convict </i>Him <i>of sin. </i>And the word used for this will go through every transgression universally: but connecting it fitly with what is before us, we say that He does not at present ask it of every sin and do this as fearing to be convicted, but we consider it in this way, that since He was ever zealous to shame the sin of the Jews, He would not have endured by this question to incite them to again accuse Him of those things of which they before said, <i>For a good work we stone Thee not but for blasphemy, and because Thou, being a Man, makest Thyself God: </i>and besides that they should bring forward the breach of the sabbath in regard to which He was judged to have exceedingly transgressed. By <i>sin </i>therefore He at present means falsehood. For if (He says) I am never yet convicted of being untrue, why are ye minded to disbelieve Me who ever speak the truth, and tell you of a surety that I am sprung of the Very Father and know not falsehood? Give therefore give to faith unhesitatingly to hold that I am surely True when I say of Myself, I <i>proceeded forth from God and am come, </i>of you that your <i>father </i>is <i>the devil, </i>for ye lie and desire to kill just as he doth. But He convicts them profitably of desiring to kill Him, cutting short thereby their attempts. For sin exposed often blushes, and after a sort withdraws, finding no way of going forward and persisting: but if it think that it lies hid, it is ever the more lifted up and with unchecked impetus creeps on to basest consummation.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>If I say the truth, why do </i>ye <i>not believe Me?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He goes often through the selfsame words, when He sees that they understand nought: for this too is a thing most befitting for teachers, not to shrink from manifoldly revolving the instruction which at the first was not taken in, in order that it may be fixed in the souls of the hearers. When therefore the liar (He says) <i>speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar just as his father:</i>----<i>why do ye </i>reasoning <a name="p659"><span><font color="#000000">|659</font></span></a> and acting not conformably to what I say, <i>not believe Me, </i>albeit <i>I say the truth, </i>[imagining] that I am therefore speaking apart from the truth, seeing that I am even so True as is the Father also? It is (I suppose) likely that He is convicting the Jews of being therefore infirm in the power of containing the words of the truth, because they are not sons of the truth. To no purpose do they falsely call God their Father, saying, <i>We have One Father, God. </i>For God (He says) being wholly Truth, rejoices in the truth and wills them <i>that worship Him, to worship Him in Spirit and in truth. </i>And the children of the truth receive willingly what is of kin to them, i. e., the Truth. But YE when I tell you <i>the truth do </i>therefore <i>not believe, </i>because ye are not children of the truth. Some such thing does the Lord seem to me to be saying to the Jews, as one will easily see if one adapt the speech to another person. For let one for example of sober character say to an unbridled son or servant or neighbour, If I seem to thee to be of sober character shunning fornication and putting the thought thereof as far from me as possible, why disbelievest thou and givest no credence when I say that it is a foul and polluted deed? One would not I suppose say that he said this, looking for an answer to his question, but whereby he shews him unbelieving clearly convicts him that he rejoicing in licentiousness does not admit the speech that would amend him.</p><p>Thus then shall we conceive as to the Jews likewise, when Christ says, <i>If I say the truth, why do </i>ye <i>not believe Me? </i>for the form of such questions has an affirmation alongside of them and ever annexed, from the very questions themselves; yea rather (may one say) the question largely convicts them. For <i>we </i>convict those who are asked of having the sickness of being without what ourselves possess. But note how He says, not absolutely nor generally, <i>why believe ye Me not? </i>but hath added YE, hinting at those who were wont more fiercely to disbelieve, and indicating that there were some there who had haply a nobler<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>mind, and did not preserve in their ways the accurate impress of Cain's stubbornness, but were even now going <a name="p660"><span><font color="#000000">|660</font></span></a> forward to being even enrolled among the children of God. For I say that we must not think that all the Jews were utterly immersed in untempered folly, but that some having <i>a zeal of God, </i>as Paul saith, <i>yet not according to knowledge, </i>did therefore delay a little as to the faith. But in those who were thus disposed we shall blame, as much looking unto wrath and intemperately kindled unto bloodthirstiness, the unholy scribes and Pharisees in particular, to whom will more fitly pertain the, <i>Why do </i>YE <i>not believe Me, </i>Christ as it were attributing to them as their own,<i> </i>boundless unbelief. For they were they who are the leaders and who persuade their subjects to go along with their profane-nesses. Rightly therefore are they accused as having <i>taken away the key of knowledge, </i>and neither entering in themselves, and hindering others. The YE therefore has its more especial application to the rulers.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>47    <i>He that is of God heareth God's words; </i>YE <i>therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We must here understand that certain are <i>of God, </i>not as though begotten of His Essence (for that were foolish), nor yet according to what is said through Paul, <i>All things </i>are <i>of God </i>(for since He is Creator and Maker of all things who giveth being to all, the Divine Paul saith that all things are of Him): but it will not harmonize so to understand it here, for all are of God, both bad and good, in so far as He is Creator of all. He says therefore that he is <i>of God </i>who by virtue and a right conversation is related to God, and accounted worthy of kinness to Him, in that He deigns to enrol such among His children. <i>He </i>therefore, He says, <i>that is of God </i>will receive most readily and gladly the Divine words (for that which is of kin and own is always dear) but he that is <i>not of God, </i>i. e., he who in no wise prizes relationship with Him, will not most gladly hear the Divine words: for neither will good easily inexist the bad, nor will longing for virtue be to them a thing worth fighting for, since their mind has been filled with the extremest depravity and looks to only its own will. <a name="p661"><span><font color="#000000">|661</font></span></a> </p><p>But when Christ says, <i>He that is of God heareth God's words, </i>let no one think that He is bidding us to give the Divine voice entry in merely our bodily ears. For who that is, even though he be a thoroughly bad man, will not surely hear the voice of him who speaketh, if he have not by some disease lost his hearing? But the word <i>heareth, </i>He here puts instead of Consents, believes and lays up in his mind, as it is said in the book of Proverbs, <i>The wise will receive commandments in his heart. </i>For that of the unwise or despisers the word borne about, like some meaningless sound and like some din that annoys to no purpose, forthwith departs from the recipients: but into the heart of the prudent like some generous soil it sinks in.</p><p>Full wisely does now the Lord, convicting the madness of the Jews and shewing that they blaspheme without restraint, say that His words are the words <i>of God. </i>For He reinstructs them (He says) to think more becomingly of Him and not to deem that of Joseph or any other of those on the earth did He of a truth spring, but to believe that of the Essence of God the Father He hath appeared God of God. Which they indeed understanding are annoyed and burn with hotter wrath, adding <i>iniquity to their iniquity, </i>as it is written, through those things whereby they insult Him yet more.  </p><blockquote><blockquote><p>48    <i>The Jews answered and said to Him, Say </i>we <i>not well that </i>Thou <i>art a Samaritan and hast a devil?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Meet is it again to bewail the madness of the Jews and the exceedingness of their folly. For they are taken by their own voice, like wild beasts when they spring upon the hand of them who are slaying them, themselves against themselves lending impetus to the steel. For when reproved of lying as their habit and custom which had grown up with them, they immediately shew that it is true, and they are cut at hearing from the Saviour that they <i>are not of God, </i>yet immediately without an interval do they shew in themselves most exact image of the devil's wickedness. For <i>a Samaritan </i>and possessed do they dare to say that <a name="p662"><span><font color="#000000">|662</font></span></a> He is Who is sprung God of God, themselves rather having in themselves the bitter and God-opposing devil: for no man saith <i>Anathema Jesus, </i>save in Beelzebub, as Paul saith. Liars therefore and insulters and railers are they hereby too found, and used to fight against God, they shall pay fit penalty to the Judge That can do all.</p><p>We must enquire again here too the reason why they call the Lord both <i>a Samaritan </i>and possessed. For the prefacing, <i>Do not </i>WE <i>well say, </i>indicates that for some reason they vilify Him both as <i>a Samaritan, </i>and the other thing too which their utterance dared. They call Him therefore a Samaritan as being indifferent to the commands of the Law and recking nought of the breach of the Sabbath. For among the Samaritans there is no exact Judaism but their worship is mixed with foreign and Greek habits. Or in another way do they say that He is <i>a Samaritan, </i>seeing it was the habit of the Samaritans to falsely testify purity of themselves and to condemn the rest as defiled. On this pretext I suppose, <i>the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans, </i>as it is written, and refuse also to mingle with some others, loathing after a sort the defilement thence arising, since thus to prate seems to them right. And the Lord condemning the ill-disposition of the Jews, used to call them devil's children, and to Himself He testifies entire blamelessness in regard to sin and utter purity saying, <i>Who of you is convicting Me of sin? </i>for this was the language of one who was plainly ascribing to Himself the uttermost purity, by reason that He could not fall into sin, and by calling the Jews Satan's children was condemning them as defiled and having their mind filled with all uncleanness, as is also true. On these accounts therefore do they call Him <i>a Samaritan, </i>they say again that He is possessed, because it is the wont of devils to transfer to themselves the honour due to God and recklessly to seize on God's glory. And this very thing they suppose that Christ does, when being man He puts Himself as it were into the place of God saying, <i>He that is of God heareth God's words: </i>for He is intimating (they say) of His own words that they are such.    Of their railing, their blasphemy rather, against <a name="p663"><span><font color="#000000">|663</font></span></a> Him such is the Jews' plea and occasion for saying those things which pledged unto them the eternal fire.</p><p>And it comes to me to wonder at this also. They angered because they were often called devil's children and liars, shew in act that the charge belongs to them, which they ought rather by inclining themselves<i> </i>to virtue to have rubbed off. For their love of railing and saying that things belong to any which do not belong to them, are most fit not for those who have been enrolled among God's children but among the devil's children. And the wretched ones not only rail, lying against their own head, not to say against Christ, but they also affirm that they are doing so <i>well, </i>not so much as condemning their wickedness: and this is the proof of the completest blindness.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>49    <i>Jesus answered, </i>I <i>have not a devil but I honour My Father and </i>YE<i> do dishonour Me.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Gentle is the word, but nevertheless very pointed. For most emphatically does He say, I <i>have not a devil, </i>and putting Himself in contradistinction to them, He shews that He is free from their railing and that it is true of them. For unless themselves had a devil, they would (it is likely) have shuddered at calling Him possessed Who was attested to them by His Deeds as God. Most excellently therefore does He say, I <i>have not, </i>transferring the speech to them and allotting it rather to them by reason that so it was in truth. I therefore <i>have not </i>(He says) but YE <i>the devil, </i>and <i>I honour My Father, </i>saying that I am God and have beamed forth of God and affirming that I knew not sin. For it needed, it needed that He Who is of God be God and that He Who is of Him Who knoweth not sin should be beheld such as He of Whom He is. But if (as is necessary the opposite should be) refusing to offend you, I had not used such splendid language (for God would not be honoured if conceived of as having a Son not God) the Father (He says) would not have been honoured if He had been called the Father of one who falls into sin. Hence in witnessing most excellent things to Myself, I in no wise  (He says) <a name="p664"><span><font color="#000000">|664</font></span></a> blaspheme as ye suppose, but rather <i>honour </i>My Father. <i>I honour </i>Him in another way too (for I say with justice of you that ye are not of God, since neither is it right that they who have come to this pitch of wickedness and are drenched in all villainy should say that they are of God. For He honours and deems worthy of kin to Him not the liar and railer and blasphemer and haughty and insolent, nor yet one whose wont it is to seek to kill unjustly, but the gentle and meek and pious and godly and good. Hence in this way too do <i>I honour the Father, </i>putting forth from kinness with Him those who are condemned for utter wickedness; and YE <i>again dishonour </i>Me doing this, and attack the praise that belongs to the Father that ye may be caught, blaspheming not only against the Son, but now against Him too. For if <i>I </i>by witnessing of Myself things most excellent, <i>honour My Father, </i>he will surely (He says) dishonour Him, who clothes Him That is of Him with the deepest reproaches. On all sides therefore is Christ consistent with His own words, and clearly shews that He is God by Nature, and whereby He says that the Father is honoured when the kinness to Him of the multitude of the unholy is thrust off, by this doth He say that the Jews are in all respects alien to God: for what more unholy than they who say those things?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>50    I <i>seek not Mine own Glory, there is That seeketh and judgeth.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Herein is that seen to be clearly true which is said through Peter of the Saviour, <i>Who when He was reviled reviled not again, suffering He threatened not but delivered Himself to Him That judgeth righteously. </i>For see how He hearing things of all the worst and cruellest from those who are impiously raging against Him (and this full oft) He abides in His own gentleness, and in no wise departs from what beseems Him, for our ensample doing this too, that we zealous to <i>follow His Footsteps </i>might not be caught in rendering <i>railing for railing, </i>nor ought else of <i>evil for evil, </i>but might rather <i>overcome evil with good.</i></p><p>I therefore <i>seek not My glory </i>(He says) and this not as <a name="p665"><span><font color="#000000">|665</font></span></a> though He were proffering to those who so willed the insulting of Him as a thing free from peril, nor yet as inciting any to go readily unto this impiety is He seen to say this, but He signifies rather thus: I am come (He says) not to make glory from you My business, nor desiring at all honour or fame: for being in the form of God the Father I have abased Myself and have for your sakes become Man as you. And He Who disdained not to take servant's form, when He might have remained in equality with God the Father and had the full enjoyment of things above mind and speech, how will He be deemed to be seeking glory from any and not rather to be enduring voluntary disgrace for others' good?</p><p>Our Lord here is either saying this, or in another way too we will suppose that He <i>seeketh not </i>His <i>own glory. </i>For it being in His Power to punish immediately those who insult Him and to demand satisfaction for their blasphemy as behaving ungodly against the Very Lord of all:----He bears calmly what is grievous and endures to that extent as not so much as to desire to grieve by a mere word the haughty ones, yet in order that blasphemy against God may not seem a beaten track to any, needs does He, forbidding them to advance thereto, straightway oppose as a barrier, the Father's wrath. For though the Son be longsuffering and do not forthwith take vengeance for His <i>own glory, </i>the Father (He says) will not be forbearing, for He will be an Avenger and will rise up against the insulters, not as though taking the part of another nor as though He were pleased to grieve in behalf of one of the saints insulted and deemed it became Him thus to do, but as though the sin reached up unto Him (for there is nought at all intervening between the Father and the Son, as far I mean as identity of Essence, even though either be conceived of as existing separately). For therefore does our Lord Jesus Christ too elsewhere say, <i>He that honoureth not the Son neither doth he honour the Father. </i>For the Son hath in Himself Naturally the Father Co-glorified and Co-existing, the Father again hath in Himself the Son partaker of His Essence, so too of <a name="p666"><span><font color="#000000">|666</font></span></a> His glory in every thing. The wretched Jews therefore will be punished for their blasphemy against the Lord and Son, impious against the whole Consubstantial and Holy Trinity and grieving in the Son the Nature that is King of all.</p><p>Every one therefore who at all practiseth piety must therefore shun in ought offending the good God. For not because He doth not immediately bring His Anger on those who offend against Him, must we therefore be supine. For He is Good, <i>not bringing on His Anger every day, </i>yet <i>if </i>we <i>turn not, He will whet His sword, </i>as it is written, and will <i>bend </i>against us <i>His Bow, </i>wherein are <i>the instruments of death, </i>that is to say, every form of shame and intolerable trouble.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>51    <i>Verily verily I say unto you, If a man keep My word, he shall not see death for ever.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He shews that it is superfluous to array long defences against those who are wont to delight in blaming; for He bends Himself to what was necessary, I mean the calling through faith unto eternal life, and all but bidding farewell to those who had through their unlearning grieved Him, He kneads up His own discourse with a sort of art. For having before said of God, <i>He that is of God heareth God's words, </i>He immediately says, <i>If a man keep My word, </i>shewing that He is by Nature God and hence teaching that no further reach of impiety yet remains to the Jews when they have said that He hath a devil Who giveth eternal Life to those who will <i>keep </i>His <i>word. </i>For will He not be known by this too to be God by Nature? for to what other will pertain the being able to quicken for ever them who hear His words, save to Him Who is God by Nature?</p><p>The Divine <i>word </i>is <i>kept, </i>when a man does not transgress the Divine Commandment but is instant and does without delay that which is bidden and is in no wise accused of sloth in the Divine laws. But note again how great exactitude the words have, for He does not endure to say, If a man hear My Word, but, <i>If a man keep My Word.    </i>For <a name="p667"><span><font color="#000000">|667</font></span></a> there receive into their ear the word of God, not men alone holden in sin, but also the unhallowed band itself of the devils: and verily Satan the chieftain of them all, when he daring to tempt in the wilderness our Lord Jesus Christ, kicking against the pricks by reason of his much ferocity of character, did set before Him the Divine word also, saying. <i>It has been written That He shall command His Angels respecting Thee to guard Thee in all Thy ways. </i>Therefore not in mere hearing is the word of salvation, nor in only learning is life, but in keeping what was heard, and as a certain rule and guide of life was He setting before [them] the Divine word. He says that the sure keeper of His words <i>shall not see death for ever, </i>not surely as taking away death in the flesh, but as God not accounting that death is death, for to Him nought is dead, in that His it is both to bring to the birth that which is not and easily to quicken that which when so wrought has decayed. Or He says that the saints <i>shall not see death in the age </i>to come, which <i>age </i>will strictly and more truly be conceived of as not having an end like this of ours; and He says that they who have kept His Divine <i>Word, shall not see death during </i>that <i>age, </i>not as though any should die after the Resurrection, for the death of all has been undone in the death of Christ and the might of decay brought to an end, but by <i>death </i>He means (as is like) being punished for ever. And you may learn this, viewing what Himself has said above: for <i>Verily </i>(He says) <i>I</i> <i>say to you, he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, he that disobeyeth</i> <i>the Son shall not see life: </i>albeit all shall rise again and shall hasten anew unto life, both faithful and faithless. For by no means is the Resurrection partial, but equally to all, so far at least that all must live again.</p><p>How then will <i>he that believeth not the Son not see life, </i>albeit all look to rise again? it is then manifest to every body that it is Christ's wont to call <i>life, </i>a long living in gladness and glory which refuseth to draw to a close, and this is treasured up in hope for the saints. As therefore He says that <i>he which disobeyeth</i> <i>the Son </i>shall have <a name="p668"><span><font color="#000000">|668</font></span></a> no sight of life albeit all look to live again, meaning here not the life of the body, but calling by this name the hope prepared for the saints: in the same way He says that the brave and intrepid keeper of His Divine <i>words shall not see death for ever, </i>not surely signifying hereby the death of the body, but the punishment prepared for the sinners. For as in the former joy is indicated through the word <i>life, </i>so here too punishment through saying <i>death.</i></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>52    <i>The Jews said to Him, Now we know that Thou hast a devil.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>They again accuse the Truth who when called liars take it ill as though they were insulted: yet do they bear witness even against their will to the Saviour's words and whereby they dishonour Him, by these very same words they shew that He is unlying. But blind are these wretched ones and they have their heart replete with so great unlearning as not even to think that they ought to wipe off those charges about which they were accused, but even to fall into evils worse than the past ones and to be caught in their own toils. For see, see by what things they think to excuse themselves as though not in vain they had railed against Him, through these they are the more convicted of being liars and are the faster <i>holden </i>(so to say) <i>in the bonds of </i>their own <i>sins. </i>In most utter folly too do they here say, <i>Now we know:</i> for they who had full often bayed against Him and declared that He hath a devil, say that <i>now </i>they <i>know </i>it, condemning their preceding unbridledness of tongue. For if <i>now </i>they <i>know </i>it, formerly they did not know it: how then did they say that He had a devil who was not yet (as themselves deemed) condemned? A liar therefore long before too was the impious people of the Jews and with unbridled tongue did it use to belch out the devil's malice against Christ. They seize hold for the confirmation of their own idle speech on what was spoken by our Saviour Christ, for their much madness thinking (it seems) that the truth would aid a lie. Next by what means it was in their power to learn that they are transgressing impiously, madly insulting the Giver of everlasting life: <a name="p669"><span><font color="#000000">|669</font></span></a> they see not that by these very means they are advancing unto intensity of the disease. For they count that it is fit not only not to repent of those things, but they even say that they are persuaded that such is the truth.........<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#3" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">3</font></u></sup></a><sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>And the Prophet is true in saying, <i>That right are the ways of the Lord and the just shall walk in them, but the ungodly shall be impotent in them.</i></p><p>But one might be astonished at their unparallelled madness in this too. Beholding a not easily numbered multitude of devils and evil spirits crushed by one word of our Saviour and cast forth against their will from those in whom they are, they shudder not at saying that He has a devil, albeit assured by necessary arguments that Satan will not cast out Satan. For <i>every kingdom </i>(says Christ) <i>divided against itself is desolated and every house and city divided against itself is desolated. And if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself; how therefore shall his kingdom stand? </i>Lo therefore (may one say and with good reason) <i>a people verily foolish and without an heart, they have eyes and see not, ears and hear not. </i>For neither by word and teaching, nor viewing with the eyes of the understanding the Nature Supreme above all, are they changed so as to will to think better; they aim at It, yea rather each at his own soul, with excess of dishonour, like as with stones.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Abraham died and the prophets died and </i>THOU <i>sayest, If any keep My saying, he shall not taste death for ever.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>When the all-daring folk of the Jews, lying against their own head, say to the Saviour, <i>Thou hast a devil, </i>they want to indicate nothing else than, Thou makest Thyself God, as having put about <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#4" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">4</font></u></sup></a> Him the honour and glory due to the Divine Nature: for such is the practice of devils as we have said before also. And they conceive of nothing beyond what is visible nor acknowledge God the Word in human form, nor vet remove their mind some little from <a name="p670"><span><font color="#000000">|670</font></span></a> corporeal things, but fastening them only on those of earth, they are conversant only with the inferior part, as subject to touch. Hence the wretched ones are offended and suppose that the Truth, that is, Christ, speaks untruly, yea and imagine that He is lifting Himself up against the glory that befits God, not solely as admitting the being placed in equal rank with Him who rules all things but as even savouring something greater, and fancying He could do, or even promising to do, what God the Father did not. For why it is that they are vexed, saying that <i>Abraham and the Prophets </i>are dead, why they are putting forward the death of the Saints in order to overturn the Saviour's words, it is meet to see.</p><p>They want therefore to express something of this sort, We have not spoken falsely in saying that <i>Thou hast a devil, </i>the proof of our words is not far off; for lo, Thou promisest to overpass God Himself in miracles and that Thou canst easily accomplish what He hath not wrought. For <i>Abraham and the Prophets, </i>albeit they kept God's word, have not gainsaid the laws of nature, but swerved and have fallen into this common death of the body, and THOU sayest that he who keeps Thy words shall be utterly untasting of death: how then dost Thou not say that Thine acts are better than His? he who supposeth that he will surpass God, how will he not be clearly distraught? For they of their great unlearning are supposing that the Lord is here pointing to only the death of the body, and promising to those who obey Him that they shall be free from bodily death, even though it be the special business of those who are sober-minded to conceive that nothing dieth to God, being quickened though it die. For if it were brought from not being into being, how will not that which was already so brought, be more readily and easily called unto the future being, even though they conceive <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#5" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">5</font></u></sup></a> that it have been put to sleep some little space for economy's sake? The Jews therefore not witting the glory of the Saviour behave <a name="p671"><span><font color="#000000">|671</font></span></a> themselves haughtily against His words, and call Him possessed, as promising to do greater things than God has wrought: and in proof of their accusation they put forward the death of Abraham and the holy Prophets, by means whereof they think to convict Christ of boasting with empty words, in promising that He will give endless Life to them that keep His word, and also of doing injury to the glory of God, in that He confesses that He will give them the greater things.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>53    <i>Art </i>THOU <i>greater than our father Abraham who died? and the Prophets died.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Overshadowed in this too is the speech of the Jews and clearly big with some deep meaning: for what again do they here say, conceiving after the manner of men, yet bitter things according to their inward scope? for lo albeit (say they) they kept the Divine word, both <i>Abraham and the Prophets </i>have died, yet we heard Thee just now promise to some greater things. For whereby Thou sayest that they shall not die at all, they are full surely greater and in better case than those mentioned, in this very fact of not dying. Therefore (for tell us, they say, and answer us who ask it) art <i>thou </i>thyself <i>greater than Abraham </i>and the Prophets, who dost promise to make others greater than they are? though they have died, wilt thou not die, but remain immortal, though a Man and having a body of earth? how then couldest Thou give to others what Thyself hast not? for Thou wilt surely die, being a Man. But if Thou <i>art </i>not <i>greater than Abraham </i>and the Prophets, being to undergo death in common with them, then Thou wilt not give to others a good which belongeth not even to Thyself: some such meaning hath what is indirectly said by them. And marvel not if they have no greater conception of Christ: for as we have ofttimes manifoldly said, they deem that He is a mere Man and one of those like us, wholly ignorant that the Only-Begotten God the Word was united to flesh. <i>Whom makest Thou Thyself? </i>Of their unmeasured madness they all but think to set right the Lord transgressing and as though He knew not what is becoming, they advise Him to think more lowly.   For (say they) Thou hast not known, <a name="p672"><span><font color="#000000">|672</font></span></a> sir, Thine own nature, Thou forgottest that Thou wert a Man, Thou wert not contented with the measure given by God: for <i>whom dost Thou make Thyself, </i>who dost promise to give better things than those of His bounty and hazardously sayest that Thou wilt accomplish things beyond His Might?</p><p>They condemn therefore as having blasphemed, they dart like scorpions upon Him, they suppose it right to blame (thinking it just) Christ as contemning the due measure of the manhood, and springing up and bounding forth to such a degree as to be borne beyond the glory inherent in the Lord of all, yea and trampling on the honour of the holy Patriarchs and Prophets: for now they look to hear Him openly cry out (in reply to those things whereby they think to incite Him, uttering of their perversity <i>Whom makest Thou Thyself?) </i>I am greater than Abraham and the Prophets: albeit the Lord in saying this would have been most true, inasmuch as there is no comparison between men and God Who is above all nature visible and spiritual.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>54    <i>Jesus answered, If </i>I <i>glorify Myself, My glory is nothing,</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The whole aim of the discourse looks in the direction of blessed Abraham and the Prophets, but the Saviour persuasively transforms to Himself what is expressed, not ignorant that prone to anger, even without any plea inviting thereto, is the Pharisee, and that he takes every one of the things uttered by Him, as an additional reason for more fiercely plotting His murder. For envy renders sin-loving those wherein it is, and persuades them more hotly to be vexed even at what they least ought. Something of this sort again does Christ will to signify. The Jews were springing upon and contradicting what was said by Him, perpetually speaking even to satiety, of Abraham and the Prophets and openly crying out, <i>Art </i>THOU <i>greater than our father Abraham who died? and the Prophets died: </i>in addition, they were accusing Him of springing upon the glory of the Saints and lifting up Himself exceeding far above them, saying to Him, <i>Whom dost Thou make Thyself? </i>It <a name="p673"><span><font color="#000000">|673</font></span></a> would then have behoved the Lord to answer in plain terms to these things and say clearly, I am superior and greater than Abraham and the prophets. But the mighty-minded Jew would not have tolerated the word, for he would forthwith have been indignant thereat and feigning to be a lover of the Father, and making believe to be advocating the glory of the saints, he would have attacked Christ more hotly and in his vexation would have seemed to be now rightly blood-thirsty: hence the Lord transferring to Himself the word says, <i>If </i>I <i>honour Myself Mine honour is nothing;</i> for He is all but saying. Let no one of those upon the earth think great things of himself; for if we would consider with ourselves what the glory of man is, we shall find it nothing at all; for <i>all flesh is grass and every glory of man as flower of grass. </i>No marvel is it then (He says) if Abraham has died and after him the prophets; for what is man's glory, when his nature tyrannized over by both death and decay is therefore likened to easily-fading grass? It seems likely that by skilfully transforming to Himself the measure pertaining to Abraham or the Prophets and saying, <i>My glory is nothing, </i>He is calling the Jew to the memory of Abraham saying most clearly of himself, I <i>am earth and ashes, </i>and of the blessed prophets crying to God, <i>Remember that we are earth. </i>And we do not say that by this He is accusing the glory of the saints, Who glorifies them: but it was necessary and the word of profit was inviting Him to shew how great the difference between His Divine and Ineffable Nature and them which are subject to death and decay.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>My Father </i>is <i>which glorifieth Me.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>For exact elucidation and idea of the things signified I will use the same words and go through the same speech. The Jews ever putting forward as an invincible question and a problem not lightly to be set aside and saying, <i>Art </i>THOU <i>greater than our father Abraham who died? and the prophets died, whom dost Thou make Thyself?: </i>and supposing in truth that He Himself too will both die and be <a name="p674"><span><font color="#000000">|674</font></span></a> subject to death and decay and will not lierein be greater than Abraham and the holy Prophets, and having no great opinion at all of Him:----at length of necessity does our Lord Jesus Christ Who is of the Eternity of Him That begat Him shew that He is Eternal, therefore He saith, <i>My Father which glorifieth Me </i>is, wishing the word is to be here conceived of not simply nor without enquiry, but rather putting it as indicative of His Father's Being: and the Son which is ineffably begotten of the Existing Father, full surely brings with Him the property of His Father, that is, Being. He is therefore superior to both Abraham and the Prophets, for the one have died as being earth-born of mortal fathers, the Other, incomprehensibly going forth from Him Who is, is ever glorified by His own Father, not as lacking glory (for He is <i>the King of Glory) </i>but as having His boast in being begotten of an Eternal Father, and being therefore Eternal Himself too, for He carries Essentially the Dignity of Him Who begat Him. Its being said that the Father glorified Him will therefore no ways injure the Son, in regard of God-befitting conception, seeing that the Father Himself too is glorified in like way by the Son, not as though He needed glory, but because the being known to be Father of such an Offspring, God, that is, as He, is esteemed to be and hath glory. Therefore the Son Himself too saith to the Father, <i>Father, glorify Thy Son that the Son too may glorify Thee. </i>Hence the glory of man is absolutely nothing, for that which is of earth falleth into death, so far as the body is concerned, even though it rise. The Only-Begotten is glorified by His Father, as having along with all the other goods that of His Essence as His very Own: to what extent He differs from the whole creation, the blessed Psalmist too briefly signifieth, crying aloud, <i>The Heavens shall perish but </i>THOU <i>shalt abide, and they all shall wax old as a garment and as a cover shalt Thou change them and they shall be changed, but </i>THOU <i>art the same and Thy years shall not fail.    </i>For subject to decay is every thing that is made <a name="p675"><span><font color="#000000">|675</font></span></a> even though it have not yet decayed, holden by the Divine Counsel that it perish not; but Incorruptible and Eternal by Nature is God, not like the Creation gaining this by Another's will, but ever existing in His own goods, in which is also His special Property.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>55    <i>Of Whom </i>YE <i>say that He is your God and ye have not known Him.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He refutes them again and that with might as practising the piety of bare words only, but exceeding far removed from truly knowing God: and all but utters against them that which was declared through the Prophet: for <i>then </i>He said, <i>This people draweth nigh to Me, with their lips they do honour Me, but their heart is far from Me, </i>and now profitably and in conformity with that olden [utterance] does He say, <i>Ye have not known Him. </i>And it is true, for not the mere knowing that He is God,----not this surely is having knowledge of God (for that God exists and is, <i>the devils too believe and tremble, </i>as it is written) but in addition to knowing that He is, it is meet to have fit and due thoughts of Him; thus----what God really is by Nature, I suppose that no sober minded person would enquire (for it were impossible to find out) but what things are His Attributes<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>or not His Attributes, one may recognize and that with ease, if one is conversant with the sacred Scriptures. For we know and have believed that He is Mighty, we know that He is not infirm, we know that He is Good, we know that He is not bad, we know that He is Righteous, and again that He is not unjust. We know that He is Eternal, we are agreed and believe that He is not bounded by time, nor yet transitory, as WE are. The Jews therefore as far as in words and voice did say and clearly confess that God is their <i>God, </i>being none the less ignorant of Him, but as far as that He is Incorruptible and Eternal, we shall not find that they understood. For had they known, they would not (I suppose) have sunk down to that degree of distraction as to think that the Only-Begotten Son which cometh forth of His Essence would die<i>; </i>nor yet would they putting forward <a name="p676"><span><font color="#000000">|676</font></span></a> the death of Abraham and the Prophets have senselessly said, <i>Whom dost Thou make Thyself? </i>for would not a man with reason say outright<i> </i>that it was necessary that they who know Who the Father is by Nature should believe that such is the Son also who proceedeth forth of Him? for like as of a sweet source goeth forth full surely a sweet stream, and as of trees of a good sort of a good sort full surely is the offspring, so I ween must one needs believe that He who is of God by Nature is True God and He That is begotten of an Eternal Father, is Eternal as He who begat Him. Seasonable then is it to say here too to the Jews, <i>Either make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt or make the tree goodly and his fruit goodly, for a good tree cannot hear evil fruits nor a corrupt tree hear good fruits. </i>How then is it possible yea, rather how is it not replete with all folly, to deem that He who was begotten of an Immortal Father is mortal and to make Him who knoweth not corruption connumerate with those who are subject to decay?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>But </i>I <i>know Him and if I say that I know Him not I shall be like you a liar.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I spake not falsely (He says) in saying to the Jews, <i>If any keep My word he shall not see death for ever</i>; for I am able to render undying, seeing I know that He of whom I am is mighty to do this, seeing I know that My Father is by Nature Life. <i>I </i>too am therefore as He is, Life that is by Nature and Lifegiving. But if I denied My power of quickening, I should be ignorant of My Father, the Property of whose Essence <i>I</i> possessing, am able to quicken as He. Hence I confess that I have all things that are in the Father, and affirming that I am as He, and for this reason professing to do His works, <i>I </i>full surely <i>hnow Him; </i>and if I say that I have not the properties of the Father uncounterfeit in Myself, <i>I shall he a liar, </i>as you are, as though I knew not the Father. Yea and when I say that the glory of Abraham and the Prophets is nothing, seeing <a name="p677"><span><font color="#000000">|677</font></span></a> they were of earth and men by nature, to whom death is not foreign, and that My glory is the Eternity of the Father, it is as knowing the Father that I say so: and if I say that I shall fall into decay as they, and that I am not co-eternal with the Father, I shall speak falsely like you, not knowing the Father of whom I am: for it were impossible that He who is of Him That is and ever abideth the same should not full surely both be and abide ever the same, for That which is begotten of Eternal is Eternal.</p><p>For one might taking the passage before us more simply, say that it was spoken in another way: <i>I know </i>(He says) My own Father; if I said I knew not, <i>I</i> <i>shall be a liar like you </i>who know not God, but say that you know Him.</p><p>And what is the mode of knowing and what the charges of not knowing, having already clearly said, we will add nothing superfluous.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><i>But I know Him and keep His Word.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As far as belongs to the first contact of the words before us, we say this, that Christ is speaking again as man and abasing Himself to our level, not rejecting at its proper time servant-befitting guise. He says therefore that He knows the Father and keeps <i>His word. </i>And we do not surely say that He of necessity witnesses these things to Himself nor yet that He is recounting ought of what pertains to Him, but there is much art mixed up herein. For through His saying that He knows the Father and keeps <i>His word, </i>He shews that the Jews mind the contrary to the things which He affirms that He has, in that they neither know God, nor yet think that they ought to keep <i>His word: </i>for then would they have received with all zeal Him that was foreheralded through Moses and the Prophets. And we shall find among ourselves too some such fashion of speech, goodly and most excellent, having the force of rebuke and gently<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>intimating to some the evils wherein they are, but cutting off their anger at being reproved.    For instance let there be a <a name="p678"><span><font color="#000000">|678</font></span></a> man religious and otherwise good, who reproaching the thief and the drunkard says, <i>I </i>am a religious person, I have not stolen what is another's, nor yet have I ever been drunk. And such an one is not surely bearing witness to himself by this, nor shall we suppose that he is thus speaking, but he is putting the reverse of his own acquirements on those whom he is reproaching. Thus therefore our Lord Jesus Christ too says that He knows the Father and keeps <i>His word, </i>in reverse wise hereby putting about the unholy Jews, that they neither know God nor yet endure His word, or deem worthy of any observance at all the Law prescribed them from above.</p><p>But if we must in another way too apply to what is before us and look more subtilly at what is covertly intimated, we shall say this besides, The Son knows His own Father, not having knowledge of such kind as is in us, but Godbefitting and inexplicable. For as man that is begotten of man, not as though learning from any other but from whence himself is, is not ignorant of the nature of him who begat him; so the Son too from whence He is knows His own Father and preserves <i>His word</i>, i. e., has the definition of His Essence preserved whole in Himself, for <span>λόγος</span> means definition. For the <span>λόγος</span> of a man, i. e., the definition of his essence, is, a living creature rational, mortal, recipient of mind and knowledge: the <span>λόγος</span><i> </i>for example of an angel will be the definition of his being. But of God by Nature we may not receive count<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>or definition, for we know not what He is by Nature, but the Son knoweth His own Father and Begotten of His Essence knoweth what He is by Nature Who begat Him; and taking of our usage and serving Himself of human words, He says that He retains in Himself the Father's <i>word</i>, as though the definition of His Essence: for He is the Image of Him That begat Him and the Impress in no wise charged with unlikeness but having in Himself all the God-befitting Excellencies of Him Who begat Him.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>56    <i>Abraham your father exulted to see My Day and saw and rejoiced.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>He here calls <i>day </i>nought else save the time of His Advent <a name="p679"><span><font color="#000000">|679</font></span></a> wherein the Very Light beamed upon us and the Sun of Righteousness arose, the darkness relaxed that held us like a mist while the <i>prince of this world </i>yet tyrannized, darkening (so to speak) the whole world with his perversities, thrusting it down unto idolatrous error, diversely darkening the mind of each one. Therefore the Divine Psalmist too knowing as a <i>day </i>the thrice-longed-for time of His Advent, fore-uttered it in the Spirit, <i>This is the Day which the Lord made, let us exult and rejoice in it. </i>Otherwise, it is the custom of the holy Scripture to call the time for each work, <i>day, </i>as, <i>For the day of the Lord of Hosts is upon every insulter and haughty one and they shall be abased, </i>and again, <i>What will ye do in the day of the assembly and in the day of the feast of the Lord? </i>yea and the Psalmist says that <i>in that day </i>shall the <i>thoughts </i>of certain <i>perish, </i>donning again as <i>day </i>the time of the Divine and looked-for Tribunal, wherein will nought avail to the renowned of the world the deceit of their olden <i>thoughts </i>and the empty swelling of the brow at its wealth.</p><p><i>Your father Abraham </i>therefore (He says) <i>exulted to see My Day and saw and rejoiced. </i>And how or when we shall suppose that blessed Abraham saw the <i>Day </i>of our Saviour Christ, i. e., the time of His Advent with flesh? Not open to view is the utterance (for one cannot take it and just<sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>speak and explain it) yet considering well what belongs hereto (as we are able) we will say that God revealed His own Mystery just as to one of the holy Prophets. Or we shall grant that he truly saw the day of the Lord's slaughter (on account whereof all things have turned out auspiciously unto us and were made prosperous), when for a type of Him he was enjoined to offer up for a sacrifice his only-begotten and first-born, Isaac: for it is like that as he was executing the priest's office at that time, the exact force of the Mystery was made clear as in a type in that which was wrought.</p><p>One may give other occasions also for this to those who are more zealous for learning. For he saw <i>three men at the oak in Mamre, </i>yea and received promise from God that he should be <i>a father of many nations, </i>which could in no other <a name="p680"><span><font color="#000000">|680</font></span></a> way be fulfilled, save that the Gentiles were called through the faith Christ-ward, inscribing Abraham their father and about to <i>sit down with </i>him <i>in the kingdom of heaven </i>and to co-partake with him in the munificence unto all good things of our Saviour. Blessed <i>Abraham </i>therefore (He says) <i>saw and </i>seeing <i>rejoiced at My Day. </i>And why Christ proceeds to say these things also, we must needs speak of.</p><p>The Jews beholding Him a Man by reason of the veil of flesh, were conceiving of nothing God-befitting about Him, but were supposing that He too is mortal like us, as being brought from not being into being, and they would not of their great ill-counsel believe that He was Eternal, as being of the Eternal Father. In order then that He might clearly shew, that He is not recent nor just-made as are we, but that He was known of their very oldest Fathers also as being Eternal, does He say these things. In the same does He (it seems) profitably reproach them, because acting ill-advisedly and foolishly minded they spurn what was a very gala to the beginner of their race. For he did but <i>see </i>and he <i>rejoiced, </i>they having Him and it being in their power to enjoy Him insult Him by their unbelief and set themselves in braggart wise<i> </i>against so glorious grace. Or perhaps He covertly intimates this that He is both greater and superior to Abraham seeing it was to him a festal assembly, to only know somewhat of Him: for He could not say it openly and apart from any veil, by reason of their being mighty to wrath, but He indicates it in another way.</p><p>And let no one suppose that Jesus in saying <i>Abraham your father </i>[died <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_06_book6.htm#6" rel="nofollow"><sup><u><font color="#0066cc" size="3">6</font></u></sup></a>], contradicts Himself, in that He in one place removes them from relation with Abraham, saying, <i>If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham, </i>but now again calls them Abraham's sons: but we must know that well does He in either case direct His discourse unto the truth. For in the former, defining the quality of spiritual nobility, He depicts a relation in sameness of habits, here He allots them mere bare kindred of <a name="p681"><span><font color="#000000">|681</font></span></a> the flesh, that both in the former He may be true, and here not false.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>57 <i>The Jews said therefore to Him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Utterly without understanding is the Jews' speech, and big with much absurdity, and one may wonder (and with much reason) at their proceeding to so great lack of understanding, as to be utterly unable to conceive as they ought. For though our Saviour Christ had devised full many turns of speech, over and over going through the same words and manifoldly indicating therein His own Eternity, they think no whit more than they see with the eyes of the body, but as though utterly distraught and the whole power of their mind deranged, they reach not forth their heart unto what beseems God, but as if He were some man like us, <i>then </i>barely beginning to be and be accounted among things that are, when he was born, they senselessly accuse Him of a lie, not even deeming aright of what they heard Him say. For He said that <i>Abraham </i>had seen His <i>Day, </i>they turn about to the contrary the force of His word, for (say they) <i>Thou art not yet fifty years old and </i>how <i>hast Thou </i>beheld <i>Abraham? </i>miserable therefore is the senseless Jew, ever comrade of much uninstructedness, and making madness his wild foster brother. </p><blockquote><blockquote><p>58   <i>Jesus said to them, Verily verily I say to you, before Abraham was </i>I <i>am.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Again does Christ advance to His wonted and favourite contrivance, for He speaks at times exceeding obscurely and overshadowing His exposition with diverse veils suffers it not to be open to all. But when He sees that the hearers understand nothing at all, then having stripped His discourse of its obscurity, He sets it before them plain and clear. And this He studies to do on the present occasion. For since He found that they understood nought (albeit a long discourse had been gone through) nor yet were able <a name="p682"><span><font color="#000000">|682</font></span></a> to understand that He is both Eternal as being of an Eternal Father, and that He is incomparably greater than Abraham as being God, He now says openly, adding <i>Amen</i><sup><font size="3"> </font></sup>in the rank of an oath for confirmation of the things said, <i>Before Abraham was </i>I <i>am. </i>And we shall in no wise think that the Only-Begotten is boasting of being before Abraham only, for He is before all time and hath His Generation most ancient, being without beginning in the Father. But since the comparison with Abraham was before Him at present, He says that He is elder than he; just as if the number 100, for instance, were to say, I am greater than 10: it would not surely be saying this, as having the next place above ten, but because it is exceeding much superior and above ten. He therefore is not rivalling Abraham's times, nor does He affirm that He is some little precedent to his times: but since He is above all time, and o'erpasseth the number of every age, He says that He is before Abraham, uttering a truth.</p><p>And exceeding rightly and well does He of Abraham put, Was, of Himself, <i>I am, </i>shewing that to him that was made of things which are not, will full surely follow the necessity of decaying, to Him That ever is will never befall the passing into not being.</p><p>Greater therefore is He and Superior to Abraham: greater as Eternal, Superior for that He decays not as he does.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>59    <i>They took up therefore stones to cast at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went forth of the temple.</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>They see not the truth (in that they are verily both liars themselves, and have <i>a liar </i>for their father, as the Saviour saith) but are angry at no vexing thing. Supposing that they ought to contend for the glory of their forefather as though wronged, they were kindled thereby unto no seasonable anger, albeit they ought to have known the force of the things said and who it was Who thus speaks: but turning aside unto most unreasonable and beast-befitting madness, they endeavour to aim at Him with stones, as though they had not sufficiently offended Him by their <a name="p683"><span><font color="#000000">|683</font></span></a> already much railing, or were drawing upon themselves by their folly some small wrath. Hot therefore and most foolish is the attempt of the Jews, but it passes not into act out of season, for the time of His Passion was yet to come.</p><p>Christ hides Himself, not retreating beneath walls, not interposing ought else before His Body, but by the power of His Godhead rendering Himself invisible to them who seek Him. And it was not enough to escape their notice but He also goeth forth <i>of the temple, </i>limning to us a sort of type herein of things spiritual. For to them that love Him He is manifest always (as it is said, <i>Blessed are the pure in heart, because they shall see God) </i>but hastens away from those who are prone to fight against God, and is seen of none who behave impiously, nor yet loveth to be with after a sort and to dwell with them that persecute Him, but rather doth He depart from them and removeth, taking away with Him all joy, and leaving bare of graces from Him those by whom He is evil entreated, in regard (I mean) of their wishing to do Him wrong, and of the attempts of the impious ones, even though Christ shews all things to be vain, by His unspeakable might bringing to nought the unholy daring of those who transgress against Him.</p></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

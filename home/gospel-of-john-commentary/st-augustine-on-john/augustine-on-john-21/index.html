After telling us of the incident in connection with which the disciple Thomas
had offered to his touch the places of the wounds in Christ's body, and saw
what he would not believe, and believed, the evangelist John interposes these
words, and says: And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His
disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written that you
may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may
have life through His name. This paragraph indicates, as it were, the end of
the book; but there is afterwards related how the Lord manifested Himself at
the sea of Tiberias, and in the draught of fishes made special reference to the
mystery of the Church, as regards its future character, in the final
resurrection of the dead. I think, therefore, it is fitted to give special
prominence thereto, that there has been thus interposed, as it were, an end of
the book, and that there should be also a kind of preface to the narrative that
was to follow, in order in some measure to give it a position of greater
eminence. The narrative itself begins in this way: After these things Jesus
showed Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise
showed He (Himself). There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called
Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
other of His disciples. Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say
unto him, We also go with you.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The inquiry is usually made in connection with this fishing of the disciples,
why Peter and the sons of Zebedee returned to what they were before being
called by the Lord; for they were fishers when He said to them, Come after me,
and I will make you fishers of men. Matthew 4:19 And they put such reality into
their following of Him then, that they left all in order to cleave to Him as
their Master: so much so, that when the rich man went away from Him in sorrow,
because of His saying to him, Go sell that you have, and give to the poor, and
you shall have treasure in heaven, and come follow me, Peter said to Him, Lo,
we have forsaken all, and followed You. Why is it then that now, by the
abandonment as it were of their apostleship, they become what they were, and
seek again what they had forsaken, as if forgetful of the words they had once
listened to, No man, putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit
for the kingdom of heaven? Luke 9:62 Had they done so when Jesus was lying in
the grave, before He rose from the dead — which of course they could not have
done, as the day whereon He was crucified kept them all in closest attention
till His burial, which took place before evening; while the next day was the
Sabbath, when it was unlawful for those who observed the ancestral custom to
work at all; and on the third day the Lord rose again, and re called them to
the hope which they had not yet begun to entertain regarding Him — yet had they
then done so, we might suppose it had been done under the influence of that
despair which had taken possession of their minds. But now, after His
restoration to them alive from the tomb, after the most evident truth of His
revivified flesh offered to their eyes and hands, not only to be seen, but also
to be touched and handled; after inspecting the very marks of the wounds, even
to the confession of the Apostle Thomas, who had previously declared that he
would not otherwise believe; after the reception by His breathing on them of
the Holy Spirit, and after the words poured from His lips into their ears, As the
Father has sent me, even so send I you: whose soever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them; and whose soever ye retain, they are retained: they
suddenly become again what they had been, fishers, not of men, but of fishes.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

We have therefore to give those who are disturbed by this the answer, that they
were not prohibited from seeking necessary sustenance by their manual craft,
when lawful in itself, and warranted so long as they preserved their
apostleship intact, if at any time they had no other means of gaining a
livelihood. Unless any one have the boldness to imagine or to affirm, that the
Apostle Paul attained not to the perfection of those who left all and followed
Christ, seeing that, in order not to become a burden to any of those to whom he
preached the gospel, he worked with his own hands for his support: 2
Thessalonians 3:8 wherein we find rather the fulfillment of his own words, I
labored more abundantly than they all; and to which he added, yet not I, but
the grace of God that was with me: 1 Corinthians 15:10 to make it manifest that
this also was to be imputed to the grace of God, that both with mind and body
he was able to labor so much more abundantly than they all, that he neither
ceased from preaching the gospel, nor drew, like them, his present support out
of the gospel; while he was sowing it much more widely and fruitfully through
multitudes of nations where the name of Christ had never previously been
proclaimed. Whereby he showed that living, that is, deriving their subsistence,
by the gospel, was not imposed on the apostles as a necessity, but conferred on
them as a power. And of this power the same apostle makes mention when he says:
If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your
carnal things? If others are partakers of this power among you, are not we
rather? But, he adds, we have not used this power. And a little afterwards he
says: They who serve the altar are partakers with the altar: even so has the
Lord ordained, that they who preach the gospel should live of the gospel; but I
have used none of these things. It is clear enough, therefore, that it was not
enjoined on the apostles, but put in their power, not to find their living
otherwise than by the gospel, and of those to whom by preaching the gospel they
sowed spiritual things, to reap their carnal things; that is, to take their
bodily support, and, as the soldiers of Christ, to receive the wages due to
them, as from the inhabitants of provinces subject to Christ. Hence that same
illustrious soldier had said a little before, in reference to this matter, Who
goes a warfare any time at his own charges? Which he nevertheless did himself;
for he labored more abundantly than they all. If, then, the blessed Paul— that
he might not use with them the power which he certainly possessed along with
the other preachers of the gospel, but went a warfare at his own charges, that
the Gentiles, who were utterly averse to the name of Christ, might not take
offense at his teaching, as something offered them for a money equivalent — in
a way very different from that in which he had been educated, learned an
altogether new art, that while the teacher supports himself with his own hands,
none of his hearers might be burdened; how much rather did the blessed Peter, who
had beforetimes been a fisherman, do what he was already acquainted with, if at
that present time he found no other means of gaining a livelihood?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

But some one will reply, And why did he not find them, when the Lord had
promised, saying, Seek first the kingdom and righteousness of God, and all
these things shall be added unto you? Matthew 6:33 Precisely also in this very
way did the Lord fulfill His promise. For who else placed there the fishes that
were to be caught, but He, who, we are bound to believe, threw them into the
penury that compelled them to go a fishing, for no other reason than that He
wished to show them the miracle He had prepared, that so He might both feed the
preachers of His gospel, and at the same time enhance that gospel itself, by
the great mystery which He was about to impress on their minds by the number of
the fishes? And on this subject we also ought now to be telling you what He
Himself has set before us.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Simon Peter, therefore, says, I go a fishing. Those who were with him say unto
him, We also go with you. And they went forth, and entered into a ship; and
that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood
on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus says
unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered Him, No. He says unto
them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. When
Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat unto him, for he was
naked, and did cast himself into the sea. And the other disciples came in a
little ship (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred
cubits), dragging the net with fishes. As soon then as they had come to land,
they saw a fire of coals laid, and a fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus says
unto them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught. Simon Peter went up, and
drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and
for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

This is a great mystery in the great Gospel of John; and to commend it the more
forcibly to our attention, the last chapter has been made its place of record.
Accordingly, inasmuch as there were seven disciples taking part in that
fishing, Peter, and Thomas, and Nathaneal, and the two sons of Zebedee, and two
others whose names are withheld, they point, by their septenary number, to the
end of time. For there is a revolution of all time in seven days. To this also
pertains the statement, that when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the
shore; for the shore likewise is the limit of the sea, and signifies therefore
the end of the world. The same end of the world is shown also by the act of
Peter, in drawing the net to land, that is, to the shore. Which the Lord has
Himself elucidated, when in a certain other place He drew His similitude from a
fishing net let down into the sea: And they drew it, He said, to the shore. And
in explanation of what that shore was, He added, So will it be in the end of
the world. Matthew 13:48-49</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

That, however, is a parable in word, not one embodied in outward action; and
just as in the passage before us the Lord indicated by an outward action the
kind of character the Church would have in the end of the world, so in the same
way, by that other fishing, He indicated its present character. In doing the
one at the commencement of His preaching and this latter after His
resurrection, He showed thereby in the former case that the capture of fishes
signified the good and bad presently existing in the Church; but in the latter,
the good only, whom it will contain everlastingly, when the resurrection of the
dead shall have been completed in the end of this world. Furthermore, on that
previous occasion Jesus stood not, as here, on the shore, when He gave orders
for the taking of the fish, but entered into one of the ships, which was
Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land; and He
sat down therein, and taught the crowds. And when He had left speaking, He said
to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. There
also they put the fishes that were caught into the ship, and did not, as here,
draw the net to the shore. By these signs, and any others that may be found, on
the former occasion the Church was prefigured as it exists in this world, and
on the other, as it shall be in the end of the world: the one accordingly took
place before, and the other subsequently to the resurrection of the Lord;
because there we were signified by Christ as called, and here as raised from
the dead. On that occasion the nets are not let down on the right side, that the
good alone might not be signified, nor on the left, lest the application should
be limited to the bad; but without any reference to either side, He says, Let
down your nets for a draught, that we may understand the good and bad as
mingled together: while on this He says, Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, to signify those who stood on the right hand, the good alone. There the
net was broken on account of the schisms that were meant to be signified; but
here, as then there will be no more schisms in that supreme peace of the
saints, the evangelist was entitled to say, And for all they were so great,
that is, so large, yet was not the net broken; as if with reference to the
previous time when it was broken, and a commendation of the good that was here
in comparison with the evil that preceded. There the multitude of fishes caught
was so great, that the two vessels were filled and began to sink, Luke 5:3-7
that is, were weighed down to the point of sinking; for they did not actually
sink, but were in extreme jeopardy. For whence exist in the Church the great
evils under which we groan, save from the impossibility of withstanding the
enormous multitude that, almost to the entire subversion of discipline, gain an
entrance, with their morals so utterly at variance with the pathway of the
saints? Here, however, they cast the net on the right side, and now they were
not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. What is meant by the words,
Now they were not able to draw it, but this, that those who belong to the
resurrection of life, that is to say, to the right hand, and depart this life
within the nets of the Christian name, will be made manifest only on the shore,
in other words, when they shall rise from the dead at the end of the world?
Accordingly, they were not able to draw the nets so as to discharge into the
vessel the fishes they had caught, as was done with all of those wherewith the
net was broken, and the boats laden to sinking. But the Church possesses those
right-hand ones after the close of this life in the sleep of peace, lying hid
as it were in the deep, till the net reach the shore whither it is being drawn,
as it were two hundred cubits. And as on that first occasion it was done by two
vessels, with reference to the circumcision and the uncircumcision; so in this
place, by the two hundred cubits, I am of opinion that there is symbolized,
with reference to the elect of both classes, the circumcision and the
uncircumcision, as it were two separate hundreds; because the number that
passes to the right hand is represented summarily by hundreds. And last of all,
in that former fishing the number of fishes is not expressed, as if the words
were there acted on that were uttered by the prophet, I have declared and
spoken; they are multiplied beyond number: while here there are none beyond
calculation, but the definite number of a hundred and fifty and three; and of
the reason of this number we must now, with the Lord's help, give some account.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

For if we determine on the number that should indicate the law, what else can
it be but ten? For we have absolute certainty that the Decalogue of the law,
that is, those ten well-known precepts, were first written by the finger of God
on two tables of stone. Deuteronomy 9:10 But the law, when it is not aided by
grace, makes transgressors, and is only in the letter, on account of which the
apostle specially declared, The letter kills, but the spirit gives life. 2
Corinthians 3:6 Let the spirit then be added to the letter, lest the letter
kill him whom the spirit makes not alive, and let us work out the precepts of
the law, not in our own strength, but by the grace of the Saviour. But when
grace is added to the law, that is, the spirit to the letter, there is, in a
kind of way, added to ten the number of seven. For this number, namely seven,
is testified by the documents of holy writ given us for perusal, to signify the
Holy Spirit. For example, sanctity or sanctification properly pertains to the
Holy Spirit, whence, as the Father is a spirit, and the Son a spirit, because
God is a spirit, so the Father is holy and the Son holy, yet the Spirit of both
is called peculiarly by the name of the Holy Spirit. Where, then, was there the
first distinct mention of sanctification in the law but on the seventh day? For
God sanctified not the first day, when He made the light; nor the second, when
He made the firmament; nor the third, when He separated the sea from the land,
and the land brought forth grass and timber; nor the fourth, wherein the stars
were created; nor the fifth, wherein were created the animals that live in the
waters or fly in the air; nor the sixth, when the terrestrial living soul and
man himself were created; but He sanctified the seventh day, wherein He rested
from all His works. The Holy Spirit, therefore, is aptly represented by the
septenary number. The prophet Isaiah likewise says, The Spirit of God shall
rest on Him; and thereafter calls our attention to that Spirit in His septenary
work or grace, by saying, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety; and He shall be filled
with the spirit of the fear of God. Isaiah 11:2-3 And what of the Revelation?
Are they not there called the seven Spirits of God, Revelation 3:1 while there
is only one and the same Spirit dividing to every one severally as He will? 1
Corinthians 12:11 But the septenary operation of the one Spirit was so called
by the Spirit Himself, whose own presence in the writer led to their being
spoken of as the seven Spirits. Accordingly, when to the number of ten,
representing the law, we add the Holy Spirit as represented by seven, we have
seventeen; and when this number is used for the adding together of every
several number it contains, from 1 up to itself, the sum amounts to one hundred
and fifty-three. For if you add 2 to 1, you have 3 of course; if to these you
add 3 and 4, the whole makes 10; and then if you add all the numbers that
follow up to 17, the whole amounts to the foresaid number; that is, if to 10,
which you had reached by adding all together from 1 to 4, you add 5, you have
15; to these add 6, and the result is 21; then add 7, and you have 28; to this
add 8, and 9, and 10, and you get 55; to this add 11 and 12, and 13, and you
have 91; and to this again add 14, 15, and 16, and it comes to 136; and then
add to this the remaining number of which we have been speaking, namely, 17,
and it will make up the number of fishes. But it is not on that account merely
a hundred and fifty-three saints that are meant as hereafter to rise from the
dead unto life eternal, but thousands of saints who have shared in the grace of
the Spirit, by which grace harmony is established with the law of God, as with
an adversary; so that through the life-giving Spirit the letter no longer kills,
but what is commanded by the letter is fulfilled by the help of the Spirit, and
if there is any deficiency it is pardoned. All therefore who are sharers in
such grace are symbolized by this number, that is, are symbolically
represented. This number has, besides, three times over, the number of fifty,
and three in addition, with reference to the mystery of the Trinity; while,
again, the number of fifty is made up by multiplying 7 by 7, with the addition
of 1, for 7 times 7 make 49. And the 1 is added to show that there is one who
is expressed by seven on account of His sevenfold operation; and we know that
it was on the fiftieth day after our Lord's ascension that the Holy Spirit was
sent, for whom the disciples were commanded to wait according to the promise.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

It was not, then, without a purpose that these fishes were described as so many
in number, and so large in size, that is, as both an hundred and fifty-three,
and large. For so it is written, And He drew the net to land full of great
fishes, an hundred and fifty and three. For when the Lord said, I am not come
to destroy the law, but to fulfill, because about to give the Spirit, through
whom the law might be fulfilled, and to add thereby, as it were, seven to ten;
after interposing a few other words He proceeded, Whosoever therefore shall
break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be
called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. The latter,
therefore, may possibly belong to the number of great fishes. But he that is
the least, who undoes in deed what he teaches in word, may be in such a church
as is signified by that first capture of fishes, which contains both good and
bad, for it also is called the kingdom of heaven, as He says, The kingdom of
heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of ever kind;
Matthew 13:47 where He wishes the good as well as the bad to be understood, and
of whom He declares that they are yet to be separated on the shore, to wit, at
the end of the world. And lastly, to show that those least ones are reprobates
who teach by word of mouth the good which they undo by their evil lives, and
that they will not be even the least, as it were, in the life that is eternal,
but will have no place there at all; after saying, He shall be called the least
in the kingdom of heaven, He immediately added, For I say unto you, That unless
your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees,
you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:17-20 Such, doubtless
— these scribes and Pharisees— are those who sit in Moses' seat, and of whom He
says, Do ye what they say, but do not what they do; for they say, and do not.
Matthew 23:2-3 They teach in sermons what they undo by their morals. It
therefore follows that he who is least in the kingdom of heaven, as the Church
now exists, shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, as the Church shall be
hereafter; for by teaching what he himself is in the habit of breaking, he can
have no place in the company of those who do what they teach, and therefore
will not be in the number of great fishes, seeing it is he who shall do and
teach that shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. And because he will
be great here, therefore shall he be there, where he that is least shall not
be. Yea, so great will they certainly be there, that he who is less there is
greater than the greatest here. Matthew 11:11 And yet those who are great here,
that is, who do the good that they teach in that kingdom of heaven into which
the net gathers good and bad, shall be greater still in that eternal state of
the heavenly kingdom, — those, I mean, who are indicated by the fishes here as
belonging to the right hand and to the resurrection of life. We have still to
discourse, as God shall grant us ability, on the meal that the Lord took with
those seven disciples, and on the words He spoke after the meal, as well as on
the close of the Gospel itself; but these are topics that cannot be included in
the present lecture.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

With this third manifestation of Himself by the Lord to His disciples after His
resurrection, the Gospel of the blessed Apostle John is brought to a close, of
which we have already lectured through the earlier part as we were able, on to
the place where it is related that an hundred and fifty-three fishes were taken
by the disciples to whom He showed Himself, and for all they were so large, yet
were not the nets broken. What follows we have now to take into consideration,
and to discuss as the Lord enables us, and as the various points may appear to
demand. When the fishing was over, Jesus says unto them, Come [and] dine. And
none of those who sat down dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was
the Lord. If, then, they knew, what need was there to ask? And if there was no
need, wherefore is it said, they dared not, as if there were need, but, from
some fear or other, they dared not? The meaning here, therefore, is: so great
was the evidence of the truth that Jesus Himself had appeared to these
disciples, that not one of them dared not merely to deny, but even to doubt it;
for had any of them doubted it, he ought certainly to have asked. In this
sense, therefore, it was said, No one dared to ask Him, Who are You? as if it
were, No one dared to doubt that it was He Himself.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

And Jesus comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise. We are
likewise told here, you see, on what they dined; and of this dinner we also
will say something that is sweet and salutary, if we, too, are made by Him to
partake of the food. It is related above that these disciples, when they came to
the land, saw a fire of coals laid, and a fish laid thereon, and bread. Here we
are not to understand that the bread also was laid upon the coals, but only to
supply, They saw. And if we repeat this verb in the place where it ought to be
supplied, the whole may read thus: They saw coals laid, and fish laid thereon,
and they saw bread. Or rather in this way: They saw coals laid, and fish laid
thereon; they saw also bread. At the Lord's command they likewise brought of
the fishes which they themselves had caught; and although their doing so might
not be actually stated by the historian, yet there has been no silence in
regard to the Lord's command. For He says, Bring of the fishes which you have
now caught. And when we have such certainty that He gave the order, will any
suppose that they failed to obey it? Of this, therefore, the Lord prepared the
dinner for these His seven disciples, namely, of the fish which they had seen
laid upon the coals, with an addition thereto from those which they had caught,
and of the bread which we are told with equal distinctness that they had seen.
The fish roasted is Christ having suffered; He Himself also is the bread that
comes down from heaven. With Him is incorporated the Church, in order to the
participation in everlasting blessedness. For this reason is it said, Bring of
the fish which you have now caught, that all of us who cherish this hope may
know that we ourselves, through that septenary number of disciples whereby our
universal community may in this passage be understood as symbolized, partake in
this great sacrament, and are associated in the same blessedness. This is the
Lord's dinner with His own disciples, and herewith John, although having much
besides that he might say of Christ, brings his Gospel, with profound thought
and an eye to important lessons, to a close. For here the Church, such as it
will be hereafter among the good alone, is signified by the draught of an
hundred and fifty-three fishes; and to those who so believe, and hope, and
love, there is demonstrated by this dinner their participation in such
super-eminent blessedness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

This was now, he says, the third time that Jesus showed Himself to His
disciples after that He was risen from the dead. And this we are to refer not
to the manifestations themselves, but to the days (that is to say, taking the
first day when He rose again, and the [second] eight days after, when the
disciple Thomas saw and believed, and [the third] on this day when He so acted
in connection with the fishes, although how many days afterwards it was that He
did so we are not told); for on that first day He was seen more than once, as
is shown by the collated testimonies of all the evangelists: but, as we have
said, it is in accordance with the days that His manifestations are to be
calculated, making this the third; for that [manifestation] is to be reckoned
the first, and all one and the same, as included in one day, however often and
to however many He showed Himself on the day of His resurrection; the second
eight days afterwards, and this the third, and thereafter as often as He
pleased on to the fortieth day, when He ascended into heaven, although all of
them have not been recorded in Scripture.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

So when they had dined, He says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of John, do you
love me more than these? He says unto Him, Yea, Lord; You know that I love You.
He says unto him, Feed my lambs. He says to him again, Simon, [son] of John, do
you love me? He says unto Him, Yea, Lord; You know that I love You. He says
unto Him, Feed my lambs. He says unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of John,
do you love me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Do you
love me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love
You. He says unto him, Feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you
were young you girded yourself, and walked whither you would, but when you
shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you,
and carry you whither you will not. And this spoke He, signifying by what death
he should glorify God. Such was the end reached by that denier and lover;
elated by his presumption, prostrated by his denial, cleansed by his weeping,
approved by his confession, crowned by his suffering, this was the end he
reached, to die with a perfected love for the name of Him with whom, by a
perverted forwardness, he had promised to die. He would do, when strengthened
by His resurrection, what in his weakness he promised prematurely. For the
needful order was that Christ should first die for Peter's salvation, and then
that Peter should die for the preaching of Christ. The boldness thus begun by
human temerity was an utter inversion of the order that had been instituted by
the Truth. Peter thought to lay down his life for Christ, the one to be
delivered in behalf of the Deliverer, seeing that Christ had come to lay down
His life for all His own, including Peter also, which, you see, was now done.
Now and henceforth a true, because graciously bestowed, strength of heart may
be assumed for incurring death itself for the name of the Lord, and not a false
one presumptuously usurped through an erroneous estimate of ourselves. Now
there is no need that we should any more fear the passage out of the present
life, because in the Lord's resurrection we have a foregoing illustration of
the life to come. Now you have cause, Peter, to be no longer afraid of death,
because He lives whom you mourned when dead, and whom in your carnal love you
tried to hinder from dying in our behalf. Matthew 16:21-22 You dared to step in
before the Leader, and you trembled before His persecutor: now that the price
has been paid for you, it is your duty to follow the Buyer, and follow Him even
to the death of the cross. You have heard the words of Him whom you have
already proved to be truthful; He Himself has foretold your suffering, who
formerly foretold your denial.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

But first the Lord asks what He knew, and that not once, but a second and a
third time, whether Peter loved Him; and just as often He has the same answer,
that He is loved, while just as often He gives Peter the same charge to feed
His sheep. To the threefold denial there is now appended a threefold
confession, that his tongue may not yield a feebler service to love than to
fear, and imminent death may not appear to have elicited more from the lips
than present life. Let it be the office of love to feed the Lord's flock, if it
was the signal of fear to deny the Shepherd. Those who have this purpose in
feeding the flock of Christ, that they may have them as their own, and not as
Christ's, are convicted of loving themselves, and not Christ, from the desire
either of boasting, or wielding power, or acquiring gain, and not from the love
of obeying, serving, and pleasing God. Against such, therefore, there stands as
a wakeful sentinel this thrice inculcated utterance of Christ, of whom the
apostle complains that they seek their own, not the things that are Jesus
Christ's. Philippians 2:21 For what else mean the words, Do you love me? Feed
my sheep, than if it were said, If you love me, think not of feeding yourself,
but feed my sheep as mine, and not as your own; seek my glory in them, and not
your own; my dominion, and not yours; my gain, and not yours; lest you be found
in the fellowship of those who belong to the perilous times, lovers of their
own selves, and all else that is joined on to this beginning of evils? For the
apostle, after saying, For men shall be lovers of their own selves, proceeded
to add, Lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, wicked, irreligious, without affection, false accusers,
incontinent, implacable, with out kindness, traitors, heady, blinded; lovers of
pleasures more than of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power
thereof. 2 Timothy 3:1-5 All these evils flow from that as their fountain which
he stated first, lovers of their own selves. With great propriety, therefore,
is Peter addressed, Do you love me? and found replying, I love You: and the
command applied to him, Feed my lambs, and this a second and a third time. We
have it also demonstrated here that love and liking are one and the same thing;
for the Lord also in the last question said not Diligis me? But, Amas me? Let
us, then, love not ourselves, but Him; and in feeding His sheep, let us be
seeking the things which are His, not the things which are our own. For in some
inexplicable way, I know not what, every one that loves himself, and not God,
loves not himself; and whoever loves God, and not himself, he it is that loves
himself. For he that cannot live by himself will certainly die by loving himself;
he therefore loves not himself who loves himself to his own loss of life. But
when He is loved by whom life is preserved, a man by not loving himself only
loves the more, when it is for this reason that he loves not himself [namely]
that he may love Him by whom he lives. Let not those, then, who feed Christ's
sheep be lovers of their own selves, lest they feed them as if they were their
own, and not His, and wish to make their own gain of them, as lovers of money;
or to domineer over them, as boastful; or to glory in the honors which they
receive at their hands, as proud; or to go the length even of originating
heresies, as blasphemers; and not to give place to the holy fathers, as those
who are disobedient to parents; and to render evil for good to those who wish
to correct them, because unwilling to let them perish, as unthankful; to slay
their own souls and those of others, as wicked; to outrage the motherly bowels
of the Church, as irreligious; to have no sympathy with the weak, as those who
are without affection; to attempt to traduce the character of the saints, as
false accusers; to give loose reins to the basest lusts, as incontinent; to
make lawsuits their practice, as implacable; to know nothing of loving service,
as those who are without kindness; to make known to the enemies of the godly
what they are well aware ought to be kept secret, as traitors; to disturb human
modesty by shameless discussions, as heady; to understand neither what they say
nor whereof they affirm, 1 Timothy 1:7 as blinded; and to prefer carnal
delights to spiritual joys, as those who are lovers of pleasures more than
lovers of God. For these and such like vices, whether all of them meet in a
single individual, or whether some dominate in one and others in another,
spring up in some form or another from this one root, when men are lovers of
their own selves. A vice which is specially to be guarded against by those who
feed Christ's sheep, lest they be seeking their own, not the things that are
Jesus Christ's, and be turning those to the use of their own lusts for whom the
blood of Christ was shed. Whose love ought, in one who feeds His sheep, to grow
up unto so great a spiritual fervor as to overcome even the natural fear of
death, that makes us unwilling to die even when we wish to live with Christ.
For the Apostle Paul also says that he had a desire to be dissolved, and to be
with Christ, Philippians 1:23 and yet he groans, being burdened, and wishes not
to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.
2 Corinthians 5:4 And so to His present lover the Lord said, When you shall be
old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry
you whither you would not. For this He said to him, signifying by what death he
should glorify God. You shall stretch forth your hands, He said; in other
words, you shall be crucified. But that you may come to this, another shall
gird you, and carry you, not whither you would, but whither you would not. He
told him first what would happen, and then how it should come to pass. For it
was not after being crucified, but when actually about to be crucified, that he
was carried whither he would not; for after being crucified he went his way,
not whither he would not, but rather whither he would. And though when set free
from the body he wished to be with Christ, yet, were it only possible, he had a
desire for eternal life apart from the grievousness of death, to which grievous
experience he was unwillingly carried, but from it [when all was over] he was willingly
carried away; unwillingly he came to it, but willingly he conquered it, and
left this feeling of infirmity behind that makes every one unwilling to die — a
feeling so permanently natural, that even old age itself was unable to set the
blessed Peter free from its influence, even as it was said to him, When you
shall be old, you shall be led whither you would not. For our consolation the
Saviour Himself transfigured also the same feeling in His own person when He
said, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; Matthew 26:39 and
He certainly had come to die without having any necessity, but only the
willingness to die, with power to lay down His life, and with power to take it
again. But however great be the grievousness of death, it ought to be overcome
by the power of that love which is felt to Him who, being our life, was willing
to endure even death in our behalf. For if there were no grievousness, even of
the smallest kind, in death, the glory of the martyrs would not be so great. But
if the good Shepherd, who laid down His own life for His sheep, has raised up
so many martyrs for Himself out of the very sheep, how much more ought those to
contend to death for the truth, and even to blood against sin, who are
entrusted by Him with the feeding, that is, with the teaching and governing of
these very sheep? And on this account, along with the preceding example of His
own passion, who can fail to see that the shepherds ought all the more to set
themselves closely to imitate the Shepherd, if He was so imitated even by many
of the sheep under whom, as the one Shepherd and in the one flock, the
shepherds themselves are likewise sheep? For He made all those His sheep for
[all of] whom He died, because He Himself also became a sheep that He might suffer
for all.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

It is no unimportant question why the Lord, when He manifested Himself for the
third time to the disciples, said to the Apostle Peter, Follow me; but of the
Apostle John, Thus I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you? To
the discussion or solution of this question, according as the Lord shall grant
us ability we devote the last discourse of this work. When the Lord, then, had
announced beforehand to Peter by what death he was to glorify God, He says unto
him, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved
following; who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he
that shall betray You? Peter, therefore, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and
what [of] this man? Jesus says unto him, Thus do I wish him to remain till I
come, what is that to you? You follow me. Then went this saying abroad among
the brethren, that that disciple dies not: yet Jesus said not unto him, He dies
not; but, Thus do I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You
see the great extent in this Gospel of a question which, by its depth, must
exercise in no ordinary way the mind of the inquirer. For why is it said to
Peter, Follow me, and not to the others who were likewise present? Surely the
disciples followed Him also as their Master. But if it is to be understood only
in reference to his suffering, was Peter the only one that suffered for the
truth of Christianity? Was there not present there among those seven, another
son of Zebedee, the brother of John, who, after His ascension, is plainly
recorded to have been slain by Herod? Acts 12:2 But some one may say that, as
James was not crucified, it was properly enough said to Peter, Follow me, inasmuch
as he underwent not only death, but, like Christ, even the death of the cross.
Be it so, if no other explanation can be found that is more satisfactory. Why,
then, was it said of John, Thus do I wish him to remain till I come, what is
that to you? and the words repeated, You follow me, as if that other,
therefore, were not to follow, seeing He wished him to remain till He comes.
Who can readily believe that anything else was meant than what the brethren who
lived at the time believed, namely, that that disciple was not to die, but to
abide in this life till Jesus came? But John himself removed such an idea, by
giving a flat contradiction to the report that the Lord had said so. For why
should he add, Jesus says not, He dies not, save to prevent what was false from
taking hold of the hearts of men?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="color:rgb(63,76,107);letter-spacing:-0.25pt;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

But let any one who so lists still refuse his assent, and declare that what
John asserts is true enough, that the Lord said not that that disciple dies
not, and yet that this is the meaning of such words as He is here recorded to
have used; and further assert that the Apostle John is still living, and
maintain that he is sleeping rather than lying dead in his tomb at Ephesus. Let
him employ as an argument the current report that there the earth is in sensible
commotion, and presents a kind of heaving appearance, and assert whether it be
steadfastly or obstinately that this is occasioned by his breathing. For we
cannot fail to have some who so believe, if there is no want of those also who
affirm that Moses is alive; because it is written that his sepulchre could not
be found, Deuteronomy 34:6 and that he appeared with the Lord on the mountain
along with Elias, Matthew 17:3 of whom we read that he did not die, but was
translated. 2 Kings 2:11 As if Moses' body could not have been hid somewhere in
such a way as that its position should altogether escape discovery by men, and
be raised up therefrom by divine power at the time when Elias and he were seen
with Christ just as at the time of Christ's passion many bodies of the saints
arose, and after His resurrection appeared, according to Scripture, to many in
the holy city. Matthew 27:52-53 But still, as I began to say, if some deny the
death of Moses, whom Scripture itself, in the very passage where we read that
his sepulchre could nowhere be found, explicitly declares to have died; how
much more may occasion be taken from these words where the Lord says, Thus do I
wish him to stay till I come, to believe that John is sleeping, but still
alive, beneath the ground? Of whom we have also the tradition (which is found
in certain apocryphal scriptures), that he was present, in good health, when he
ordered a sepulchre to be made for him; and that, when it was dug and prepared
with all possible care, he laid himself down there as in a bed, and became
immediately defunct: yet as those think who so understand these words of the
Lord, not really defunct, but only lying like one in such a condition; and,
while accounted dead, was actually buried when asleep, and that he will so remain
till the coming of Christ, making known meanwhile the fact of his life by the
bubbling up of the dust, which is believed to be forced by the breath of the
sleeper to ascend from the depths to the surface of the grave. I think it quite
superfluous to contend with such an opinion. For those may see for themselves
who know the locality whether the ground there does or suffers what is said
regarding it, because, in truth, we too have heard of it from those who are not
altogether unreliable witnesses.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Meanwhile let us yield to the opinion, which we are unable to refute by any
certain evidence, lest we stir up still another question that may be put to us,
Why the very ground should seem in a kind of way to live and breathe upon the
interred corpse? But can so great a question as the one before us be settled on
such grounds as these, if by a great miracle, such as can be wrought by the
Almighty, the living body lies so long asleep beneath the ground, till the
coming of the end of the world? Nay, rather, does there not arise a wider and
more difficult one, why Jesus bestowed on the disciple, whom He loved beyond
the others to such an extent that he was counted worthy to recline on His
breast, the gift of a protracted sleep in the body, when He delivered the blessed
Peter, by the eminent glory of martyrdom, from the burden of the body itself,
and vouchsafed to him what the Apostle Paul said that he desired, and committed
to writing, namely, to be let loose, and to be with Christ? Philippians 1:23
But if, what is rather to be believed, Saint John declared that the Lord said
not, He dies not, for the very purpose that no such meaning might be attached
to the words which He used; and his body lies in its sepulchre lifeless like
those of others deceased; it remains, if that really takes place which report
has spread abroad regarding the soil, which grows up anew, though continually
carried away, that it is either so done for the purpose of commending the
preciousness of his death, seeing it wants the commendation of martyrdom (for
he suffered not death at a persecutor's hand for the faith of Christ), or on
some other account that is concealed from our knowledge. Still there remains
the question, why the Lord said of one who was destined to die, Thus I wish him
to remain till I come.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

And who, besides, would not be disposed, in the case of these two apostles,
Peter and John, to make this further inquiry, why the Lord loved John better,
when He Himself was better loved by Peter? For wherever John has something to
say of himself, in order that the reference may be understood without any
mention of his name, he adds this, that Jesus loved him, as if he were the only
one so loved, that he might be distinguished by this mark from the others, who
were all of them certainly loved by Christ: and what else, when he so spoke,
did he wish to be understood but that he himself was more abundantly loved? And
far be it that he should utter a falsehood. And what greater proof could Jesus
have given of His own greater love to him than that this man, who was only a
partner with the rest of his fellow disciples in the great salvation, should be
the only one that leaned on the breast of the Saviour Himself? And further,
that the Apostle Peter loved Christ more than the others, may be adduced from
many documentary evidences; but to go no further after others, it is plainly
enough apparent in the lesson almost immediately preceding the present, in
connection with that third manifestation of the Lord, when He put to him the
question, Do you love me more than these? He knew it, of course, and yet asked,
in order that we also, who read the Gospel, might know Peter's love to Christ,
both from the questions of the One and the answers of the other. But when Peter
only replied, I love You, without adding, more than these, his answer contained
all that he knew of himself. For he could not know how much He was loved by any
other, not being able to look into that other's heart. But by saying in the
earliest of his answers, Yea, Lord, You know, he stated in clear enough terms,
that it was with perfect knowledge of all that the Lord asked what He asked.
The Lord therefore knew, not only that Peter loved Him, but also that he loved
Him more than the others. And yet if we propose to ourselves, in the way of inquiry,
which of the two is the better, he that loves Christ more or he that loves Him
less, who will hesitate to answer, he is the better that loves Him more? If, on
the other hand, we propose this question, which of the two is the better, he
that is loved less or he that is loved more by Christ, without any doubt we
shall reply that he is the better who is loved the more by Christ. In the
comparison therefore which I drew first, Peter is superior to John; but in the
latter, John is preferred to Peter. Accordingly, we have a third to propose in
this form: Which of the two disciples is the better, he that loves Christ less
than his fellow disciple [does], and is loved more than his fellow disciple by
Christ? Or he who is loved less than his fellow disciple by Christ, while he,
more than his fellow disciple, loves Christ? Here it is that the answer plainly
halts, and the question grows in magnitude. As far, however, as my own wisdom
goes, I might easily reply, that he is the better who loves Christ the more, but
he the happier who is loved the more by Christ; if only I could thoroughly see
how to defend the justice of our Deliverer in loving him the less by whom He is
loved the more, and him the more by whom He is loved the less.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

I shall therefore, in the manifested mercy of Him whose justice is hidden, set
about the discussion, in order to the solution of a question of such
importance, in accordance with the strength which He may graciously bestow: for
hitherto it has only been proposed, not expounded. Let this, then, be the
commencement of its exposition, namely, that we bear in mind that in this
corruptible body, which burdens the soul, Wisdom 9:15 we live a miserable life.
But we who are now redeemed by the Mediator, and have received the earnest of
the Holy Spirit, have a blessed life in prospect, although we possess it not as
yet in reality. But a hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why
does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it. Romans 8:24-25 And it is in the evils that every one
suffers, not in the good things that he enjoys, that he has need of patience.
The present life, therefore, whereof it is written, Is not the life of man a
term of trial upon earth? Job 7:1 in which we are daily crying to the Lord,
Deliver us from evil, Matthew 6:13 a man is compelled to endure, even when his
sins are forgiven him, although it was the first sin that caused his falling
into such misery. For the penalty is more protracted than the fault; lest the fault
should be accounted small, were the penalty to end with itself. On this account
it is also, either for the demonstration of our debt of misery, or for the
amendment of our passing life, or for the exercise of the necessary patience,
that man is kept through time in the penalty, even when he is no longer held by
his sin as liable to everlasting damnation. This is the truly lamentable but
unblameable condition of the present evil days we pass in this mortal state,
even while in it we look with loving eyes to the days that are good. For it
comes from the righteous anger of God, whereof the Scriptures say, Man, that is
born of woman, is of few days and full of anger: Job 14:1 for the anger of God
is not like that of man, the disturbance of an excited man, but the calm fixing
of righteous punishment. In this anger of His, God restrains not, as it is
written, His tender mercies; but, besides other consolations to the miserable,
which He ceases not to bestow on mankind, in the fullness of time, when He knew
that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son, Galatians 4:4 by whom
He created all things, that He might become man while remaining God, and so be
the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus: 1 Timothy 2:5 that
those who believe in Him, being absolved by the laver of regeneration from the
guilt of all their sins — to wit, both of the original sin they have inherited
by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted,
and of all others contracted by evil conduct — might be delivered from
perpetual condemnation, and live in faith and hope and love while sojourning in
this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and
perilous temptations on the one hand, but the consolations of God, both bodily
and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to
them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from sins,
which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the
salutary remedies of alms whereby their prayers might be aided when He taught
them to say, Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. Matthew 6:12
So does the Church act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this
Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on
account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper
personality, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by still more
abounding grace one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to
him, I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever you
shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose
on earth, shall be loosed in heaven, he represented the universal Church, which
in this world is shaken by various temptations, that come upon it like torrents
of rain, floods and tempests, and falls not, because it is founded upon a rock
(petra), from which Peter received his name. For petra (rock) is not derived
from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the
Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord
said, On this rock will I build my Church, because Peter had said, You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God. Matthew 16:16-19 On this rock, therefore, He
said, which you have confessed, I will build my Church. For the Rock (Petra)
was Christ; 1 Corinthians 10:4 and on this foundation was Peter himself also
built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ
Jesus. 1 Corinthians 3:11 The Church, therefore, which is founded in Christ
received from Him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter,
that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is
essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock (petra); and
in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the
Church. This Church, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives
amidst evil, by loving and following Christ is delivered from evil. But its
following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the truth. But
to the universality [of the Church] is it said, Follow me, even as it was for
the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter says,
Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His
footsteps. 1 Peter 2:21 This, then, you see is why it was said to him, Follow
me. But there is another, an immortal life, that is not in the midst of evil:
there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a
riddle, 1 Corinthians 13:12 even when much progress is made in the beholding of
the truth. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to
herself from heaven, that are known to the Church, whereof the one is in faith,
the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in
the eternity of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on
the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the
wages of contemplation; one declines from evil and makes for good, the other
has no evil to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a
foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of
adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its
carnal lusts, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is
anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory;
the one is helped in temptations, the other, free from all temptations,
rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent,
the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the sins of
others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything
to pardon nor does anything for which pardon has to be asked; the one is
scourged with evils that it may not be elated with good things, the other is
free from all evil by such a fullness of grace that, without any temptation to
pride, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerns both
good and evil, the other has only that which is good presented to view:
therefore the one is good, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed.
This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of
the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its
termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of
this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter,
Follow me; but of the former, Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is
that to you? You follow me. For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes,
so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, You follow me by imitating me in
the endurance of temporal evils; let him remain till I come to restore
everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let
perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let
contemplation only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come.
For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, follows
Christ; but the fullness of knowledge tarries till Christ come, to be
manifested then. For here the evils of this world are endured in the land of the
dying, while there shall be seen the good things of the Lord in the land of the
living. For in saying, I wish him to tarry till I come, we are not to
understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait;
seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but
when Christ has come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, You
follow me, unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in
this life of activity, the more we love Christ the more easily are we delivered
from evil. But He loves us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it,
that we may not be always such as we are. There, however, He loves us more; for
we shall not have anything about us to displease Him, or anything that He will
have to separate us from: nor is it for anything else that He loves us here but
that He may heal and translate us from everything He loves not. Here,
therefore, [He loves us] less, where He would not have us remain; there in
larger measure, whither He would have us to be passing, and out of that wherein
He would not that we should perish. Let Peter therefore love Him, that we may
obtain deliverance from our present mortality; let John be loved by Him, that
we may be preserved in the immortality to come.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

But by this line of argument we have shown why Christ loved John more than
Peter, not why Peter loved Christ more than John. For if Christ loves us more
in the world to come, where we shall live unendingly with Him, than in the
present, from which we are in the course of being rescued, that we may be
always in the other, it does not follow on that account that we shall love Him
less when better ourselves; since we can in no possible way be better
ourselves, save by loving Him more. Why was it, then, that John loved Him less
than Peter, if he signified that life, wherein He must be more abundantly
loved, but because on that very account it was said, I will that he tarry, that
is wait, till I come; for we have not yet the love itself, which will then be
greater far, but are expecting that future, that we may have it when He shall
come? Just as in his own epistle the same apostle declares, It has not yet
appeared what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be
like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. 1 John 3:2 Then accordingly shall we
love the more that which we shall see. But the Lord Himself, in His
predestinating knowledge, loves more that future life of ours that is yet to
come, such as He knows it will be hereafter in us, in order that by so loving
us He may draw us onward to its possession. Wherefore, as all the ways of the
Lord are mercy and truth, we know our present misery, because we feel it; and
therefore we love more the mercy of the Lord, which we wish to be exhibited in
our deliverance from misery, and we ask and experience it daily, especially in
the remission of sins: this it is that was signified by Peter, as loving more,
but less beloved; because Christ loves us less in our misery than in our
blessedness. But the contemplation of the truth, such as it then shall be, we
love less, because as yet we neither know nor possess it: this was signified by
John as loving less, and therefore waiting both for that state itself, and for
the perfecting in us of that love to Him, to which He is entitled, till the
Lord come; but loved the more, because that it is, which is symbolized by him,
that makes him blessed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Let no one, however, separate these distinguished apostles. In that which was
signified by Peter, they were both alike; and in that which was signified by
John, they will both be alike hereafter. In their representative character, the
one was following, the other tarrying; but in their personal faith they were
both of them enduring the present evils of the misery here, both of them
expecting the future good things of the blessedness to come. And such is the
case, not with them alone, but with the holy universal Church, the spouse of
Christ, who has still to be rescued from the present trials, and to be
preserved in the future happiness. And these two states of life were symbolized
by Peter and John, the one by the one, the other by the other; but in this life
they both of them walked for a time by faith, and the other they shall both of
them enjoy eternally by sight. For the whole body of the saints, therefore,
inseparably belonging to the body of Christ, and for their safe pilotage
through the present tempestuous life, did Peter, the first of the apostles,
receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven for the binding and loosing of sins;
and for the same congregation of saints, in reference to the perfect repose in
the bosom of that mysterious life to come did the evangelist John recline on
the breast of Christ. For it is not the former alone but the whole Church, that
binds and looses sins; nor did the latter alone drink at the fountain of the
Lord's breast, to emit again in preaching, of the Word in the beginning, God
with God, and those other sublime truths regarding the divinity of Christ, and
the Trinity and Unity of the whole Godhead. which are to be yet beheld in that
kingdom face to face, but meanwhile till the Lord's coming are only to be seen
in a mirror and in a riddle; but the Lord has Himself diffused this very gospel
through the whole world, that every one of His own may drink thereat according
to his own individual capacity. There are some who have entertained the idea —
and those, too, who are no contemptible handlers of sacred eloquence — that the
Apostle John was more loved by Christ on the ground that he never married a
wife, and lived in perfect chastity from early boyhood. There is, indeed, no
distinct evidence of this in the canonical Scriptures: nevertheless it is an
idea that contributes not a little to the suitableness of the opinion expressed
above, namely, that that life was signified by him, where there will be no
marriage.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and
we know that his testimony is true. And there are also, he adds, many other
things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I
suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be
written. We are not to suppose that in regard to local space the world would be
unable to contain them; for how could they be written in it if it could not
bear them when written? But perhaps it is that they could not be comprehended
by the capacity of the readers: although, while our faith in certain things
themselves remains unharmed, the words we use about them may not unfrequently
appear to exceed belief. This will not take place when anything that was
obscure or dubious is in course of exposition by the setting forth of its
ground and reason, but only when that which is clear of itself is either
magnified or extenuated, without any real departure from the pathway of the
truth to be intimated; for the words may outrun the thing itself that is
indicated only in such a way, that the will of him that speaks, but without any
intention to deceive, may be apparent, so that, knowing how far he will be
believed, he, orally, either diminishes or magnifies his subject beyond the
limit to which credit will be given. This mode of speaking is called by the
Greek name hyperbole, by the masters not only of Greek, but also of Latin literature.
And this mode is found not only here, but in several other parts also of the
divine literature: as, They set their mouths against the heavens; and, The top
of the hair of such as go on in their trespasses; and many others of the same
kind, which are no more wanting in the sacred Scriptures than other tropes or
modes of speaking. Of these I might give a more elaborate discussion, were it
not that, as the evangelist here terminates his Gospel, I am also compelled to
bring my discourse to a close.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

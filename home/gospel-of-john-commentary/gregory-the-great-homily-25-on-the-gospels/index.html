recounts the appearance of the risen Christ to Mary Magdalene, near the tomb:
all in tears, she believes the Lord taken away, until she recognizes him in the
guise of the one she took for the gardener. Gregory comments on this page of
the Gospel with emotion. He does not hide his veneration for Mary Magdalene,
whom he considers to be one with the sinner whom St. Luke shows us at the feet
of Jesus (cf Lk 7, 36-50, commented passage in Homily 33 ) and with Mary,
sister of Lazarus. Very happily, the speaker brings Marie-Madeleine closer to
the Bride of the Song of Songs. Love, tears and desire characterize these two
characters.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Homily
presents itself in two parts: the first comments on the gospel verse by verse;
the second exposes the doctrine of redemption, Christ's victory over death,
Satan and sin. The conclusion invites sinners to penance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I- (1-6) A
sinner, Mary has washed by her tears the defilement of her sins. She remains
alone in the tomb after the departure of the disciples, and thus deserves to
see the Lord. All this first part of Homily is consecrated by St. Gregory to
sing in Mary Magdalene the immense strength of charity when it sets a soul on
fire. One can not read such a passage without feeling won by the fire burning
in the preacher's heart.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">II- (7-10)
Turning then to a proper theological theme, the Pope compares the Redemption to
the fishing hook of Leviathan, of which Job speaks. The devil bit into the bait
of the humanity of Christ, and the sting of the deity pierced his jaw, forcing
him to release his other prey. Thanks to which it is now possible for us to
escape his mouth by penance. And this is where our speaker joins Saint Mary
Magdalene, from whom he seemed to have gone so far. How many examples of the
mercies of the Lord are given to us, he exclaims: Peter, the thief, Zacchaeus
and Mary. Like them, let us return to tears and avoid sin.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

time Mary was standing by the tomb outside, crying. While weeping, she leaned
over and looked into the tomb; She saw two angels in white, sitting one at the
head, the other at the feet of the place where the body of Jesus had been laid.
They said to her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She said to them,
"Because my Lord was taken away, and I do not know where it was put."
Having said that, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know
it was Jesus. Jesus said to him, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you
looking for? "She, thinking that he was the gardener, said to her,"
Lord, if you took it away, tell me where you put it, and I will take it.
"Jesus said to him, "Mary!" She turned around and said to her,
"Rabboni!", that is to say, "Master." Jesus said to him,
"Do not touch me, for I have not yet gone back to my Father. But go to my
brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my
God and your God. "Mary Magdalene went to announce to the disciples that
she had seen the Lord and that he had told her these things. .</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

had been taken away, and she announced it to the disciples. They came, found,
and thought that he was well as this woman had told them. The text then notes
about them: "Then the disciples returned to their homes" (Jn 20:10).
Then he adds: "Mary, she stood near the tomb, outside, and wept."
This is what should make us measure the strength of love that inflamed the soul
of this woman. The disciples went away, but she did not go away from the tomb
of the Lord. She was looking for the one she had not found; she cried while
looking for him, and, inflamed by the fire of her love, she burned with the
desire of him whom she believed to be taken away.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So it
happened that she was then alone to see him, she who remained to look for him.
For it is perseverance that gives effectiveness to the good work. Truth does
not affirm it: "He who persevereth unto the end shall be saved" (Mt
10:22). Moreover, according to the precepts of the Law, the tail of the victim
was to be offered as a sacrifice, because the tail is at the end of the body.
But this one makes a good offering that leads the sacrifice of a good work to
its normal completion. In the same sense, it is said that Joseph was alone among
his brothers to have a dress down to the heels. And a dress descending to the
heels represents the good work carried out.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Marie,
crying, leaned over and looked into the tomb. Surely she had already seen that
the tomb was empty; she had already announced the removal of the Lord. Why is
she still bending down? Why does she want to see again? But it is that for the
one who loves, to look once is not enough, because the force of the love
increases the will to seek. She sought first without finding anything; but
because she persevered in her search, she eventually found. What happened? His
desires grew to be unsatisfied, and as they grew, they hugged what they had
found. Here we find what the Church says about the Bridegroom in the Song of
Songs: "In bed, during the night, I sought the one my soul loves. I
searched for it, and I did not find it. I will get up and go through the city.
In the streets and squares, I will look for the one my heart loves. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">(Ct 3,
1-2). And as she does not find the one she is looking for, she repeats: "I
looked for him, and I did not find him." But when one never tires of
searching, one does not take long to find; that is why she adds: "The
guards met me, those who watch over the city: 'Have you seen the one whom my
soul loves?'&gt; Hardly had I passed them than I found the one who love my soul
"(Ct 3: 3-4). We seek the Beloved in bed when in the brief moments of rest
of the present life we ​​ardently desire our Redeemer. It is in the night that
we look for it, because even if our soul watches over it, our eyes still do not
see it. But if someone has not found his Beloved, he has only to get up and go
through the city, that is to say to review in his soul the holy Church of the
elect. Let him seek it by the streets and the squares, that is to say, he
examines those who advance by the narrow way or by the broad way, in order to
endeavor to discover in them traces of the Beloved, for there are acts of
virtue to be imitated even by certain seculars.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As we
search, the guards who watch over the city meet us, in the sense that the holy
Fathers, who watch over the Church, provide for our good desires to know and
teach us by their words and writings. Hardly have we passed them than we find
the one we love, since even though our Redeemer was a man of humility among
men, he remains, by his divinity, above men. When we have passed the guards, we
therefore find the Beloved, because seeing that the prophets and apostles are
inferior to him, we come to regard him as above men, who is God by nature.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">God begins
to be sought without being found, so that we retain it more closely when we
find it. Indeed, as we have said, the holy desires grow from not being satiated
right away. If, on the contrary, they weaken themselves from not being
satisfied at once, it is because they were not real desires. Anyone who has
touched the Truth has been inflamed with this love. This is why David exclaims,
"My soul is thirsty for the living God. When will I come and appear before
the face of God? "(Ps 42: 3). And he sends us this urgent reminder:
"Seek his face constantly" (Ps 105: 4). The prophet also says,
"My soul has desired you during the night, and my spirit will look after
you from morning to the most intimate of me" (Is 26: 9). The Church also
declares in the Song of Songs, "I am wounded with love" (Ct 5, 8). It
is right that the Church be healed at the sight of the Doctor, who desires it
with such ardor that she carries in her heart a wound of love. So she says
again: "My soul melted when my Beloved spoke." (Ct 5, 6)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The soul
of one who does not seek the face of his Creator remains cold in itself and
hardens in a bad way. But that she begins to burn with the desire to follow the
one she loves, and here she is running, all melted by the fire of love.
Tormented by desire, she comes to no longer attach value to everything that
pleases her in the world; she loves nothing more than her Creator, and what
previously charmed her becomes terribly unbearable. Nothing consoles her
sadness until she sees the object of her desires. She grieves; the light itself
is in disgust. By such a fire, the rust of his sins is stripped: like gold
whose brilliance is tarnished by use, the burning soul finds its brilliance
again by this burning heat.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. This
woman who loves, who leans again in the tomb which she had already examined,
see to what fruit results the force of love which urges her to begin her search
again: "She saw two angels dressed in white, sitting one at the head, the
other at the feet of the place where the body of Jesus had been laid.
"Why, in this place occupied by the body of the Lord, do these two angels
appear sitting one at the head and the other at the feet, if not because the
word [Greek] "angel" means in Latin "the one who
announces"? Now, at the end of his Passion, it was necessary to announce
the one who is at once God before the centuries and man at the end of the
centuries. An angel is, so to speak, seated at the head, when the Apostle John
proclaims: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God" (Jn 1: 1). And an angel is, so to speak, seated at the
feet, when John affirms: "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us."
(Jn 1: 14)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In these
two angels, we can still recognize the two Testaments: one that precedes, the
other that follows. These angels are indeed connected to each other by the
place occupied by the body of the Lord: since the two Testaments agree to
announce an incarnated Lord, dead and risen, it is as if the Old Testament sat
at the head, and the New at the feet. This is why the two cherubim who cover
[their wings] the mercy seat look at each other, face to face (Ex 25, 20).
Cherub means "fullness of knowledge". What can the two cherubim
symbolize, if not the two Testaments? As for the mercy seat, he represents the incarnate
Lord, of whom John declares: "He is a propitiation for our sins." (1
Jn 2: 2). The Old Testament announces what must be done by the Lord, and the
New proclaims it, when done. They are like the two cherubim: they look at each
other turning their faces towards the mercy seat. For because they see the
incarnate Lord placed between them, their looks are in harmony, since they
agree in all that they relate of the mystery of his plan of salvation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. The
angels question Mary: "Woman, why are you crying?" She answers them:
"Because my Lord was taken away, and I do not know where it was put."
The Holy Scripture, which makes flow In us, tears of love soften them, however,
when it promises us that we will see our Redeemer.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Regarding
this story, note that the woman does not answer: "The body of my Lord was
taken away," but: "My Lord has been taken away." The Holy
Scripture sometimes expresses everything by the part, or the part by all. For
example, a part means everything when it is written about the sons of Jacob:
"Jacob went down to Egypt with seventy souls" (Genesis 46:27). For
these souls did not go down to Egypt without their bodies! But by the soul
alone, we designate the whole man, a part expressing the whole. Conversely,
only the body of the Lord lay in the tomb, and yet Mary did not seek the body
of the Lord, but the Lord who had been taken away, the whole designating the
part.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Having
said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know it
was Jesus." Note that Mary, who still doubted the Lord's Resurrection, had
to turn to see Jesus. Because his doubt had, so to speak, turned his back on
the Lord: she did not believe at all that he had risen. But because she loved
and doubted at the same time, she saw him without recognizing him; love showed it
to him, doubt hid it from him. Her ignorance is still expressed in the
following: "She did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to him,
"Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for? '"This question
about the cause of his pain aims to increase his desire, so that by naming the
person she is looking for, her love will burn with more ardor. "She,
believing it was the gardener, said to him, 'Lord, if you took it away, tell me
where you put it, and I will take it.'" It may well be that this woman,
while deceiving herself, since she took Jesus for the gardener, did not really
deceive herself. Was not he a gardener of the soul for her? Is it not he who
sowed the seed of his love in the heart of Mary, to grow green virtues?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. Why
then, seeing the one she took for the gardener, she told him without having yet
specified who she was looking for: "Lord, if it was you who carried it
away ..." She speaks about him without the to have named, as if she had
already designated the one whose desire caused her tears. But is it not in the
soul the habitual effect of a violent love, to persuade oneself that no one is
ignorant of the person to whom one constantly thinks? It is with reason that
this woman, who does not say who she seeks, says however: "If it is you who
carried it away ...", because it can not suppose unknown to others that a
continual desire him makes cry.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Jesus
saith unto him, 'Mary!'" He called him earlier a name common to all his
sex, and she did not recognize him; now he calls him by name. It is as if he
clearly said to him, "Recognize therefore the one who recognizes
you." It was declared to a perfect man too: "I have known you by your
name" (Ex 33, 12). Man is our name common to all, Moses is a proper name,
and the Lord rightly assures him that he knows him by name, as if to make it
clear to him: "I know you, not in a global way like all the others, but in
a very special way. "And because she is thus called by name, Mary
recognizes her Creator and immediately calls her" Rabboni ", that is
to say," Master. " He was at once the one she sought out, and the one
inside taught her to seek.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
evangelist does not add what the woman did, but it is clear that she heard
Jesus say to her, "Do not touch me, for I have not yet gone back to my
Father." These words show that Mary He wanted to kiss the feet of him whom
she had recognized. But the Master said to him, "Do not touch me." It
is not that the Lord refuses to be touched by women after his resurrection,
since it is written of the two women who came to his tomb: approached and held
his embraced feet. "(Mt 28,9)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. But the
reason he should not be touched is indicated in the following: "I have not
yet ascended to my Father." In our heart, indeed, Jesus goes up to his
Father when we believe him equal to Father. For in the hearts of those who do
not believe him to be equal to the Father, the Lord has not yet ascended to his
Father. It is therefore he who believes the co-eternal Son to the Father, who
really touches Jesus. Thus Jesus had already ascended to the Father in the
heart of Paul, when this apostle declared: "He who was of divine condition
did not consider usurpation to be the equal of God." (Ph 2, 6). John, too,
touched our Redeemer from the hands of faith, since he affirmed: "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was
in the beginning with God. All things were done by him "(Jn 1: 1-3). He
therefore touches the Lord who believes him equal to the Father by the eternity
of his substance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But some
may ask this question without expressing it: "How can the Son be equal to
the Father?" Human nature is astonished, in such a matter, to be unable to
understand; it remains to him the possibility of recognizing, from other
astonishing subjects, that this mystery is credible. Because she has what she
needs to quickly find an answer to this question. It is indeed certain that the
Son created his mother, and yet it is in his virginal womb that he was created
in his humanity. Why be surprised that he is equal to his Father, the one who
preceded his mother? We have also learned from Paul's testimony that
"Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God" (1 Cor 1: 24).
Thus to think that the Son is inferior to the Father is to do a peculiar wrong
to the Father by proclaiming that his wisdom is not equal to him. What a
powerful man would bear without flinching to come and say to him, "You are
great indeed, but yet your wisdom is smaller than you." The Lord Himself
declares, "The Father and I are one." (Jn 10, 30). He further states:
"The Father is greater than me" (Jn 14:28), and it is also written of
him: "He was subject" to his parents (Lk 2:51). How wonder, then,
that the Son considers himself inferior to his Father in Heaven by virtue of
his humanity, he who, through her, was already subject to his parents on earth?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
according to this humanity that he now speaks to Mary: "Go to my brothers
and say to them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and
your God." Since he says "my" then " your ", why not
merge the two saying" our "? It is that such a distinction shows the
difference of relationship that exists between him and us with regard to this
unique Father and God. "I ascend to my Father," who is by nature,
"and your Father," who is by grace. "To my God," because I
came down; "To your God", because you will go up. I am a man too, so
he is God for me; you are delivered from error, so he is God for you. Thus,
Father and God, it is different for me, because he whom he begot as God before
all ages, he has with me made man at the end of the centuries.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Mary
Magdalene went to announce to the disciples that she had seen the Lord and told
him these things." Behold, the fault of the human race is destroyed in the
very source from which it was taken. Since in heaven, it is a woman who has poured
out the man [the poison of] death, it is also a woman who, coming from the
tomb, announces life to men. And the one that records the words of him who
vivifies is the one who brought back the deadly words of the serpent. The Lord
seems to want to use not the language of words, but of the language of facts,
to tell the human race: "From the hand that handed you the drink of death,
yes, from this same hand, receive the cup of life . "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. We
briefly commented on the text of this gospel; now, with the help of the same
Lord of whom we speak, let us consider the glory of his Resurrection and the
tenderness of his paternal love. He wanted to get up from death in haste, so
that our soul does not stay long in the death of unbelief. So the psalmist says
very aptly: "At the torrent, he drinks on the way; therefore he raises his
head "(Ps 110: 7). In the human race, from the very beginning of the
world, a torrent of death had spread; but at this torrent, the Lord has watered
on the way, because he has tasted death only by passing. He also straightened
his head, because in dying he had laid in the tomb, resurrecting, he raised him
above the angels. And even where he allowed the hands of his persecutors to
exercise their fury against him for a moment, he struck the ancient enemy for
eternity. This is what the Lord clearly indicates to Blessed Job: "And
Leviathan, will you fish it with the hook?" (Jb 40, 25)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8.
Leviathan, whose name means "Add-to-them", refers to that sea-monster
who devours the human race: he who, by promising to "add" the deity
to him, stripped him of his immortality. It is he also who has suggested the
fault of treason to the first man, and who, by engaging those who follow him by
a detestable persuasion, accumulates upon them pain on pain.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">On a hook,
the bait is shown, but the sting is hidden. The Almighty Father thus caught
Leviathan on the hook by sending to death his only Incarnate Son, in which were
joined the flesh accessible to suffering, which could be seen, and the divinity
inaccessible to suffering, that we could not see. And when, by the persecutors
of the Lord interposed, the serpent bit into the bait of the body in Christ,
the sting of the deity pierced him. At first, the monster had recognized in his
miracles that Jesus was God, but to see this God so liable made him doubt what
he had first recognized. Like a hook that attracts a voracious animal by a
piece of apparent flesh, then clings to the throat of who swallowed it, the
divinity hid in the time of the Passion to carry a mortal blow. The monster let
himself be caught by the hook of the Incarnation: baited by the body, he was
pierced by the sting of the deity. There stood humanity to attract to it the
voracious animal; there was divinity to pierce him. There was weakness to
attract [the kidnapper]; there was hidden the strength that would grip his
throat. He was caught on the hook, since it was by biting that he perished. He
lost mortals, who belonged to him in law, for having dared to demand the death
of an immortal, over whom he had no right.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">9. If this
Mary of whom we speak is alive, it is because the Lord, who owed nothing to
death, has accepted to die for the human race. And ourselves, who gives us
daily return to life after our sins, if not the sinless Creator, who came down
to suffer our chastisement? Yes, the ancient enemy has now let go of the spoils
he had taken on the human race. He lost [the fruit of] his tricky victory.
Every day, sinners come back to life; every day they are torn from his mouth by
the hand of the Redeemer. So it is rightly that the voice of the Lord still
asks the blessed Job: "Will you pierce your jaw with a ring?" (Jb 40,
26). A ring encircles and tightens what it is closed on. What does this ring
mean, if not the divine mercy that envelops us? She pierces Leviathan's jaw as
she continues to show us the remedy of penance after she sees us doing what she
defends. The Lord pierces with a ring the jaw of Leviathan: in the ineffable
power of his mercy, he opposes the wickedness of the ancient enemy by sometimes
forcing him to release even those he already held. When those who have sin
return to innocence, it is as if they are falling from the monster's jaws. And
if this mouth was not pierced, who among those he once engulfed, would escape?
Did not he hold Peter in his mouth, when he denied [his Master]? Did not he
hold David in his mouth when he plunged into such an abyss of lust? But when
they both came back to life through penance, it's a little as if Leviathan had
released them through the hole in his jaw. Peter and David escaped his mouth
through the hole of his jaw, when after doing so much evil, they returned to
good doing penance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What man
can escape the mouth of Leviathan, by not committing any fault? It is there
that we recognize all that we owe to the Redeemer of the human race! He not
only forbade us to throw ourselves into the mouth of Leviathan, but he allowed
us to come out again. He did not take away the hope from the sinner, for he
pierced the jaw of the monster to leave a way of escape there: thus, the imprudent
one who did not want to take in advance the precautions avoiding him to be
Bitten, can at least escape after the bite. Heavenly medicine comes to our aid
everywhere: it gives man precepts so that he does not sin, and if he has sinned
anyway, she gives him remedies so that he does not despair. Let us fear, above
all, to let ourselves be caught in the jaws of this Leviathan by the attraction
of sin; and yet, if we are caught there, let us not despair: if we mourn all
our sins well, we will find in our jaws an opening through which we escape.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">10. Mary,
the one we are talking about, may here appear as a witness of the divine mercy,
concerning whom the Pharisee, wishing to prevent the outpouring of goodness,
said: "If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what what a
species is this woman that touches him, and that he is a sinner "(Lk
7:39). But she washed away the taints of her heart and body with her tears, and
touched the feet of her Redeemer, abandoning her wicked ways. She was sitting
at the feet of Jesus, and she listened to the word of her mouth. She had
attached herself to the living Jesus; she was looking for her, she found alive
the one she was looking for dead. And grace made him occupy such a place near
him that it was she who carried his message to the apostles, his messengers in
title.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What must
we see in this, my brethren, what must we see except the immense mercy of our
Creator, who gives us as an example of penance those whom he has revived
through penance after their fall? I cast my eyes on Peter, I consider the
thief, I examine Zacchaeus, I look at Mary, and I see everywhere only examples
of hope and penance exposed to our eyes. Look at Peter, whose faith, perhaps,
has failed. He wept bitterly over the cowardice of his denial. Look at the
thief, you who burned with wickedness and cruelty against your neighbor: about
to die, yet he repented and reached the rewards of life. Look at Zacchaeus, you
who, devoured by an ardent avarice, stripped others: he gave back the quadruple
to those whom he could steal. Look at Mary, you who, consumed by the fire of an
evil desire, have lost the purity of the flesh: she has burned carnal love in
her with the fire of divine love.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is thus
that Almighty God puts us everywhere before the eyes of models to imitate, that
everywhere he offers us examples of his mercy. Let us take abhorrence of the
bad actions, even those we have committed. Almighty God willingly forgets that
we have been guilty; he is ready to count our penance for innocence. If we are defiled
after the salutary waters [of baptism], let us come back to tears. And
according to the words of the first Pastor, "as newly born children, long
for milk" (1 Pet 2: 2). Come back, little children, into your mother's
womb, eternal wisdom; suck the generous breasts of God's tenderness; mourn your
past faults, avoid those that threaten you. Our Redeemer will comfort your
tears by one eternal joy, who, being God, lives and reigns with God the Father
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

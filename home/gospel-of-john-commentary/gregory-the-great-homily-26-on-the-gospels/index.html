</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The gospel
commented in this Homily relates the appearance of Jesus resurrected to Thomas
and the transmission of the power of the keys. These two facts allow various
developments on faith and the sacrament of penance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">That the
Lord enters in spite of the closed doors is a mystery that can not be
understood, but that Gregory puts in relation with other mysteries which
enlighten him, before explaining in what sense Jesus can say that he sends the
apostles as the Father sent him. Then the pope wonders why Christ sent twice
the Holy Spirit: from Heaven (at Pentecost) and from the earth (in today's
appearance).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The power
to forgive the sins, which the Lord gives to the apostles and their successors,
is a great honor, but also a heavy responsibility. The preacher takes to task
his confreres in the episcopate as to the manner of administering this
sacrament. From the condemnation of arbitrariness, he passes to a general rule,
and using the story of the resurrection of Lazarus as a parable, he establishes
what the proper exercise of such a power requires:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">1. The
contrition of the penitent, born by the effect of the graceful grace of God,
must precede the absolution of the priest (resurrection of Lazarus);</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2 ° - from
this contrition must be born the confession, by which the sinner makes his sin
known to the priest (Lazarus leaves the tomb);</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3 ° -
absolution must come to exempt the sinner from the pain he has deserved (the
disciples free Lazarus).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">St.
Gregory then returns to Thomas, who heals our unbelief by touching the wounds
of Christ. We are blessed to believe without seeing, provided that our faith is
followed by works. The feasts of the earth pass; what matters is not to miss
those of Heaven. Let us therefore fear the judgment of God, beside which that
of men is nothing.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">How to
believe that dust can be revived by the resurrection? The speaker, starting
from the little miracles we see in nature, responds to this difficulty at the
end of his Homily. It was since the discussion with the Patriarch Eutychios, at
the time of his embassy in Constantinople (579-585), that Gregory was

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">When
reading this gospel, a first question agitates our mind: how did the body of
the Lord, once resurrected, remain a real body, while he was able to enter the
disciples despite the closed doors? But we must know that the divine action
would have nothing more admirable if it were understood by reason, and that
faith would have no merit if human reason furnishes it with experimental
proofs. Such works of our Redeemer, which can in no way be understood by
themselves, must be meditated in the light of his other actions, so that we may
be led to believe these wonderful facts by others who are more again. For this
body of the Lord who introduced himself to his disciples despite the closed
doors is the same as his Nativity brought out in the eyes of men the closed
breast of the Virgin. It is not surprising, therefore, that our Redeemer,
having risen to live forever, entered despite the closed doors, since coming
[into this world] to die, he came out of the Virgin's womb without opening it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As the
faith of those who looked upon this visible body remained hesitant, the Lord
immediately showed them his hands and his side; he presented them with touching
the flesh he had just introduced, despite the closed doors. In this, he
manifested two astonishing and very contradictory things to each other in the
light of human reason, since after his Resurrection his body revealed itself to
be both incorruptible and tangible. Now, what touches is necessarily
corruptible, and what is not corrupted can not be touched. But in a way that
forces amazement and beyond comprehension, our Redeemer gave us to see after
his resurrection a body that was both incorruptible and tangible: by showing
him incorruptible, he invited us to reward; in giving him to touch, he
confirmed us in the faith. He showed himself at the same time incorruptible and
tangible, to show clearly that after his Resurrection, his body remained of the
same nature, but that he was raised to a very different glory.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. He said
to them, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, so am I sending
you. "That is to say," As I am God, the Father who is God has sent
me; I am a man, I send you, you who are men. "The Father sent the Son
deciding that he would incarnate for the redemption of mankind. He wanted him
to come into the world to suffer, and yet he loved that Son whom he sent to
suffer. The apostles whom he has chosen, the Lord does not send them into the
world to taste the joys of it, but he sends them, just as he himself was sent
to suffer. Thus, just as the Father loves the Son and still sends him to
suffer, so does the Lord love his disciples and send them into the world to
suffer. This is why he says: "As the Father sent me, so am I sending
you." In other words, "By sending you into the midst of the traps of
the persecutors, I love you with the same love of which the Father loves me.

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"To be
sent" can yet be understood also in the order of the divine nature [of
Christ]. Indeed, it is said of the Son that he is sent by the Father in that he
is begotten by the Father. Although the Holy Spirit, who is equal to the Father
and the Son, did not incarnate, the Son testifies that He sends it, saying,
"When the Paraclete comes, whom I will send to you from the Father.
"(Jn 15:26). If we were to understand "to be sent" only in the
sense of "incarnate", it is obvious that we could not say in the Holy
Spirit that he is sent, since he did not by no means incarnated. But his
"mission" [missio: the fact of being sent] is the procession by
virtue of which he proceeds from the Father and the Son. Therefore, just as it
is said of the Spirit that he is sent in so far as he proceeds, so too can the
Son be said, without being deceived, that he is sent as he is begotten. .</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"And having said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the
Holy Spirit.'" We have to look for why our Lord gave us the Holy Spirit, a
first time during his stay on the earth, then another time since he reigns in
Heaven. For nowhere else are we clearly told that the Holy Spirit is given, if
not here, where he is received in a breath, and later when he reveals himself
as coming from heaven in the form of tongues. multiples (see Acts 2: 1-4). Why,
then, is it first given to the disciples on earth, then sent from heaven, if
not because there are two precepts of charity, love of God and love of
neighbor? The Spirit is given to us on earth to love our neighbor, and we are
given from Heaven to love God. Just as there is only one charity, but two
precepts, there is also only one Spirit, but it is given twice: the first time
by the Lord dwelling on the earth, the second time from Heaven. Is it not
through the love of neighbor that one learns how to reach God's love? Hence the
word of John: "Whoever does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he
love God whom he does not see?" (1 Jn 4: 20)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">If, even
before the Resurrection, the Holy Spirit resided in the hearts of the disciples
to bring them to faith, it was not given them visibly until after the
Resurrection. So it is written, "The Spirit had not yet been given,
because Jesus had not yet been glorified." (Jn 7:39)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Moses said
on the same subject, "They have sucked honey from the rock and hard rock
oil" (Dt 32:13). Now, even though we will study the whole of the Old
Testament, we will find no corresponding fact in history. The people nowhere
suck the honey of the rock, no more than the oil. But since, according to
Paul's words, "the Rock was the Christ" (1 Cor 10: 4), those who saw
the facts and the miracles of our Redeemer sucked the honey from the Rock. And
they sucked the oil of the Hard Rock, because after his Resurrection, they
deserved to be anointed by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. So it is, so to
speak, a still unsteady Rock which gave honey, when the Lord, still mortal,
showed the sweetness of his miracles to the disciples. But the oil has flowed
from a hard Rock, since the Lord, who can no longer suffer after his
resurrection, has poured out the gift of his holy anointing by the breath of
the Spirit.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. It is
from this oil that the prophet says, "The yoke will rot by the presence of
the oil" (Is 10, 27). The demon held us under the yoke of his dominion,
but we were anointed with the oil of the Holy Spirit. And the yoke of the
dominion of the devil rotted from the fact that the grace of freedom has
anointed us, as Paul testifies: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
freedom." (2 Cor 3, 17 )</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Let us
know it well: if the disciples began to possess the Holy Spirit to live
themselves in innocence and to make themselves useful to a small number by
their preaching, they received this same Spirit in a visible way after the
Resurrection. of the Lord, so that he may be useful not only to a few people
but to many.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Hence the
word that accompanies this gift of the Spirit: "To whom you will forgive
sins, they will be forgiven them; and those to whom you will retain them, they
will be withheld from them. "It is good to consider to what summit of
glory God sends these disciples whom he had called to such heavy humiliations.
He not only reassures them for themselves, but also gives them the power to
release others from his chains and to exercise the primacy of the heavenly
judgment, so that in the place of God they hold sins back to some and forgive
others. It was thus that those who had consented to such an abasement were to
be brought up by God. See, those who fear the severe judgment of God become
judges of souls; and those who dreaded their own condemnation condemn or free
others.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. Without
a doubt, the bishops now take the place of these disciples. Those who are
entrusted with [episcopal] jurisdiction are given the power to bind and untie.
The honor is great, but the responsibility corresponding to this honor is
heavy. It is hard for those who do not know how to hold the reins of their own
lives to become judges of the lives of others. However, it is not uncommon to
see some of them hold the position of judges while they do not lead a life in
harmony with such a function. It happens frequently to them, either to condemn
those who do not deserve it, or to absolve others even though they are
themselves related. Often, to bind or untie their flock, they have regard to
the inclinations of their own will, and not to the gravity of the judgments. It
follows that they lose this power to bind and untie, to have exercised it
according to their own will, and not according to what the conduct of their
penitents required.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It often
happens that pastors are guided by their dislike or sympathy towards one of
their relatives. But they can not judge with dignity the causes of their flock,
those who follow their aversion or sympathy. This is why the prophet rightly
says: "They killed souls who did not die, and they gave life to souls who
do not live" (Ezek 13:19). He destroys someone who is not dying, who
condemns a righteous person; and he tries to make someone live who can not
live, the one who tries to spare a guilty person the punishment he deserves.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. It is
therefore necessary to examine each case before exercising the power to bind
and untie. We must see the fault that preceded, and the penitence that followed
this fault, so that it is indeed those whom the almighty God visits by the
grace of compunction1 who are absolved by the sentence of the pastor. Indeed,
the absolution of the prelate is valid only if it follows the decision of the
Internal Judge.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
resurrection of Lazarus, who has been dead for four days, expresses this truth
well; it manifests it in that the Lord began to call the dead and gave him
life, saying, "Lazarus, come out!" (Jn 11:43), and that the latter
came out alive from the sepulcher, he was then loosed by the disciples, as it
is written, "When he who was bound by strips was gone out, the Lord said to
his disciples, 'Delay him and let him go.'" (Jn 11:44). You see that the
disciples release alive the one who, dead, had been raised by the Master. For
if they had untied Lazarus when he was still dead, they would rather have
discovered his stench than makes their power appear. We must draw from this
remark the following observation: we must untie, by our pastoral authority,
only those whom we recognize that our Creator has given them life by
resurrecting them by his grace. And their return to life begins to manifest itself
in the confession of sins, even before it can be translated into works of
justice. This is why the Lord does not say to Lazarus, who was dead:
"Revisite!" But: "Come out!" Every sinner who conceals his
fault in his conscience hides himself and himself in the depths of his soul.
But the dead man comes out when the sinner spontaneously confesses his
iniquity. Lazarus thus hears himself saying, "Come out!" As any man
who died in his sin could be told clearly: "Why do you hide your fault in your
conscience? Go ahead without confessing this fault, you who conceal yourself
inside refusing to confess it. "Thus, let the dead come outside, that is
to say that the sinner confesses his fault. And let the disciples loosen the
one who comes out, that is to say that the pastors of the Church are taking
away from him the pain he deserved, since he was not ashamed to confess what he
had made.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I have
given these few indications as to the order to be observed in order to absolve,
so that the pastors of the Church may apply to bind or untie only with great
discernment. But whether the sentence by which the pastor binds is just or
unjust, it must be respected by the faithful, lest he who suffers it, although
he may have been bound unjustly, come to deserve another fault that sentence
which binds him. May the pastor be afraid to absolve or bind without thinking.
But let the subject subject to his power fear to be bound, even if unjustly,
and be careful not to criticize his pastor's judgment with fear, for fear that
even if he has been bound unjustly, he does not renders guilty, by the pride of
his presumptuous criticism, of a fault he has not yet committed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"But Thomas, one of the Twelve, nicknamed Didymus, was not with them when
Jesus came." This disciple alone was absent; back he heard what had
happened, but he refused to believe what he was hearing. The Lord came a second
time; he offered the incredulous disciple to touch his side, he showed him his
hands, and showing him the scar of his wounds, he healed the wound of his
unbelief.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What do
you notice, dear brothers, what do you notice in this? Is it by chance,
according to you, that this chosen disciple is at first absent, that on his
return he hears [this story], that hearing him he still doubts, that in his
doubt he touches, and that touching he believes? No, it is not due to chance,
but to a divine disposition. Celestial goodness, in fact, has led everything in
an admirable way, so that this disciple, under the influence of doubt, touches
in his Master the wounds of the flesh, and thus heals in us the wounds of
unbelief. And the incredulity of Thomas was more useful for our faith than the
faith of the disciples who believed: when Thomas is brought back to faith by
touching [the wounds of Jesus], our mind is delivered from all his doubts and
is comforted in her faith.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The Lord
thus allowed a disciple to doubt after his Resurrection, without however
abandoning him in this doubt, just as he wanted that before his birth, Mary
[his mother] had a husband, who nevertheless did not consummate the marriage .
And the disciple, doubting and then touching, became the witness of the truth
of the Resurrection, just as the husband of the Mother [of Jesus] had been the
guardian of the inviolable virginity of the latter.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. Thomas
touched and cried, "My Lord and my God!" "Jesus said to him,
'Because you saw me, Thomas, you believed.'" As the Apostle Paul tells us,
"the faith is the reality of the things we hope for, the proof of those we
do not see "(Heb 11: 1), it is very clear that faith is the proof of
things that can not be seen. Because those that are visible do not come from
faith, but from knowledge. But since Thomas lives and touched, why do you tell
him, "Because you saw me, you believed." It was because Thomas saw
one thing and believed another. The deity can not be seen by a mortal man.
Thomas therefore saw the man, and he confessed God, crying, "My Lord and
my God!" He believed on seeing, since considering the one who was truly
man, he proclaimed that he was God, what he could not see.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">9. The
rest of the text gives us immense joy: "Blessed are those who have not
seen and who have believed." This sentence does not designate us
especially, we who are attached to our Redeemer according to the mind, without
having ever seen it with our eyes of flesh? It is us that this sentence
designates, if, however, our faith is accompanied by works. Because this one
really believes who puts into practice in his works what he believes.
Conversely, Paul says about those who are faithful only by name: "They
profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds." (Tit 1,16). And
James says, "Faith without works is dead." (Jas 2: 26)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is in
the same sense that the Lord declares to the blessed Job about the ancient
enemy of the human race: "He will absorb the river and not be surprised,
and he remains confident that the Jordan will flow into his mouth "(Jb
40:23). What symbolizes the river, if not the rapid course of the human race,
which flows from its origins to its end, and like a torrent formed by the
waters of the flesh, continues its course to the end which is fixed to it? And
what does the Jordan represent, if not the baptized? Since it is in the Jordan
River that the Author of our Redemption deigned to be baptized, the Jordan
rightly designates all those who have received the sacrament of baptism. The
ancient enemy of the human race has thus absorbed the river, because from the
origin of the world to the coming of the Redeemer, with the exception of a very
small number of elected officials who have escaped him, he has dragged the
whole human race in the belly of his wickedness. It is rightly said on this
subject: "It will absorb the river and not be surprised", because it
does not make much of ravishing infidels. But the following is very serious:
"And he remains confident that the Jordan will flow into his mouth",
that is to say, after having delighted all infidels since the beginning of the
world, he thinks he can catch also the faithful. And the mouth of his evil
persuasion devours, day after day, those whose bad lives are in disagreement
with the faith they confess.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

such a fate, dear brothers, fear it with all your strength! Put to think all
the attention of your mind. Here we celebrate the Easter solemnities; but we
must live in such a way that we can reach the eternal feasts. They pass, all
the holidays we celebrate in this life. You who participate in the solemnities
present, take care not to be excluded from the eternal solemnity. What good is
it to take part in men's festivals, if we come to miss the feast of angels? The
solemnity of this life is only the shadow of the solemnity to come. We
celebrate the first year each year only to get to the one that will not be
annual, but eternal. By celebrating the first fixed date, we remember better
that we must desire the second. May our spirit, by participating in this
transient joy, warm and burn with love for the eternal joys, so that we will
taste in the Fatherland the full reality of this joy whose shade is the subject
of our meditations in the way.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

will judge the one who rose from death full of sweetness. In the day of his
dreadful judgment, he will appear with the Angels, the Archangels, the Thrones,
the Dominations, the Principalities and the Powers, while the heavens and the
earth will blaze and all the elements will serve him trembling with terror. So
keep this terrifying Judge in your sight, and fear him as he prepares to come,
so as not to be frightened, but confident, when he comes. In short, it must be
feared to no longer have to fear it. May the terror it inspires us to push us
to good works, and the fear to preserve our life from all misconduct. Believe
me, my brothers, we will be all the more reassured in his presence that now we
are more worried about our faults.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

of you had to come to court tomorrow with his adversary to defend his cause,
worried about himself and the restless mind, he might spend a whole night of
insomnia that we could well tell him the next day, and what he would answer to
the accusations. He would be very much afraid that I would be intractable to
him, and he would be afraid of appearing guilty to me. Now who am I? Or rather,
what am I? In a short time, after being a man, I will only be worm, and after
being worm, dust. If, then, we tremble with so much apprehension at the
judgment of what is only dust, how seriously should we not think of the
judgment [of a God] of such majesty, and with what terror we must not he not
foresee it?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">12. But
since there are those who are hesitating about the resurrection of the flesh,
and our teaching is better if it answers the questions you secretly ask in your
hearts, we must speak a little about faith in the resurrection. For many are
doubtful of the resurrection - as some of us have sometimes also been able to
see: seeing at the sight of the sepulchres that the flesh is falling into decay
and the bones into dust, they can not believe that the flesh and bones can form
from this dust; and they conclude, so to speak, by asking themselves, "How
could a man be reformed from the dust? How could one make a soul for ashes?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We will
answer them briefly that for God, to restore what existed was much less than to
create what did not exist. And what is so amazing that he redoes a man from the
dust, who created everything from nothing at the same time? It is indeed more
admirable to have created the sky and the earth without starting from anything
preexisting than to restore man from the earth. But we pay attention only to
ashes, and while we despair of seeing her become flesh again, we seek in a way
to embrace by reason the power of the divine work.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Such
reflections come from the fact that divine miracles that are daily lose value
to them because of their frequency. Is it not true, however, that the entire
mass of a tree that will be born is hidden in a single tiny seed? Let us put
before our eyes the magnificent image of an immense tree, and then let us know
where this tree was born, which has reached such a mass by its growth. Surely,
we will find that it originates from a tiny seed. Let us now examine this
little seed: where are the hardwoods, the rough bark, the intense taste and
smell, the generous fruits and the very green leaves hiding in it? To the
touch, the seed is not robust; Where does the hardness of wood come from? Nor
is it rough; where does the roughness of the bark spring? She has no taste;
where does the flavor of its fruit come from? She does not smell; from where
the smell of its fruits exhales? In her, nothing green; Where did the greenness
of its leaves come from? All these things are hidden together in the seed,
though they are not expected to come out together. The seed produces a root,
from the root comes out the shoot, from the shoot sprouts the fruit, and in the
fruit a seed is re-formed. Let us add that a seed is also hidden in the seed.
It is no wonder, then, that God brings back from the state of dust bones,
nerves, flesh and hair, he who daily renews the miracle of bringing out a
little seed of wood , the fruits, the leaves that form the immense mass of a
tree?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Thus, when
a soul, prey to doubt, seeks to explain what power can produce the
resurrection, it must be questioned about facts that are of the current reality
and that we can not yet understand at all by reason, so that this soul, seeing
itself incapable of penetrating a thing which it sees, after having ascertained
it with its eyes, comes to believe in that power of which it hears the promise.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So think
in yourselves, dear brothers, that God promises us; these things will remain.
Despise however what passes over time, as if it was already lost. Hurry with
all your desire for this glory of the resurrection, whose Truth shows us in it
the realization. Flee the desires of the earth, which separate us from our
Creator, because the contemplation of the almighty God that you reach is all

Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"Lord, do you want us to command the fire of heaven to come down and
consume them? And Jesus answered them, You know not what spirit you ​​belong
to; for the son of man has not come to lose souls, but to save them.” (Luke
9:54-55) The Samaritans, who did not want to receive him, certainly deserved to
be punished, but Our Lord, who had come to exercise his mercy, dismissed the
sentence that was suggested to him for to give them the opportunity to repent
and correct themselves. When the prophet Elisha, angry with children who
outraged him, cursed them, the righteousness of God avenged him, and they were
devoured by bears in a place where we do not see that there was any forest. (2
Kings 2:23) But the Savior forgives the woman of bad life who is presented to
her and whom the elders of the Jews claim to have surprised in adultery (Jn.
8:10), because the law of mercy which he began preaching taught to forgive and
not to condemn. The law given by Moses, whose sanction was vindictive justice,
was severe in the beginning. It punished with death the one who had gathered
wood on the Sabbath (Num. 15:32), it commanded to stone the son of the Egyptian
who had blasphemed against God (Lev. 24:21) and put to death many of the
children of Israel who had worshiped the golden calf. (Exod. 32:27) Each of
these two laws first of all made known to the character that was proper to it.
Thus the ancient law, more inclined to punish the culprit, appeared more severe
in the beginnings than the fear it inspired made the men more attentive and
more vigilant. The new law, on the other hand, whose character is kindness and
mercy, has shown itself in the beginning, full of gentleness and clemency, to
dispose the minds of indulgence by the charm and attraction of its love.
Subsequently, the law, whose greater severity had been motivated by the
fragility of the human race, not only softened this rigor, but was a proof of
gentleness and goodness, and the law of mercy was severe in punishment. Thus
the righteousness of God struck Ananias and Sapphira with death. (Acts 5:5,10)
Elimas, that unbelieving magician who resisted the law of God, became blind
through an effect of God's judgment and power. (Acts 13:8) King Herod, for not
having given glory to God, was struck by the angel of God and died devoured by
worms. (Acts 12:23) The preaching of mercy could have made men believe that
impunity was guaranteed to their crimes; God, therefore, tempered this
assurance with fear, showing that the forgiveness of the sins that he bestowed
upon men had for the purpose of passing them from death to life, to preserve
them with care from relapses into sin and from misfortune. to come out of this
life and to appear before their judge conscience charged with crimes; for everyone
is judged according to the state in which he died. The new law which has in it
the plenitude of mercy so as not to become an object of contempt for the
fishermen has exerted on them a severe revenge. The ancient law, on the
contrary, although it was given with punishment for punishment, has sometimes
pardoned not to appear too cruel; but it has cheated the greatest number of
sinners, because its nature was more inclined to severity. The grace of the new
law is therefore much more abundant than was the grace of the old law. Now, if
this grace is more abundant, how can it be denied that it can give what was
given by the ancient law, in which grace was much less, for it was much more
inclined to severity? If, then, it is shown that the ancient law has forgiven
repentant sinners, how can one suppose that the law of mercy is inflexible for
them? The Jews were called the children of God, and the Apostle Paul tells us
that they were baptized under Moses' guidance in the cloud and in the sea. (1
Cor. 10:2) Before they were here, they were purified so that they could then
give an account of the law they had received and if they came to sin, they
could return to God through penance, following the invitation he do them: “penance,
you who go astray, and convert." (Isa. 45:22) But, may it be said, God
invites to penance but does not promise forgiveness. If God invites sinners to
penance, their repentance cannot be barren, and God would not have made this
call to fishermen unnecessarily. It was therefore because he knew that
repentant sinners would obtain forgiveness for their sins that he gave them
this command, for he said in express words, "I do not want the sinner's
death, but rather that he converts and lives.” (Ezek. 18:32) The fruits of
penance are thus assured, we have the proof, to those who are converted to God.
We must therefore reject the impious assertion of Novation, which distorts the
meaning of the words of the Lord by saying: The Lord expresses himself thus:
"Whoever has denied me, I will deny him myself," (Matt. 10:33) that
is to say, if a Christian comes to deny the Lord for any motive, any return is
impossible to him, and that, if he returns, he has no hope of being welcomed.
And what becomes of the obligation to do penance? Let us not forget that after
this sentence the Savior did not, however, deny his Apostle Peter, who had
denied him. Why? Because, under the inspiration of repentance, he cried his
fault with bitter tears (Matt. 26:75), because he knew that God forgave
repentant sinners and that penance changed the dispositions of their hearts.
Novatian himself assumes that one must do penance. Pressed that he is by the
law, he does not dare to deny openly that one must refuse penance: he therefore
tries by his subtleties to deprive it of its fruits. Since he dares to say that
he who has denied God has no longer any hope of forgiveness, but that he will
be denied even in the presence of the angels of God, is there not hypocrisy on
his part to recommend to do penance? But his bad faith appears throughout his
day when he adds: "He that has sinned against the Holy Spirit, it shall
not be given him in this world or in the other." (Matt. 12:32) Although
the sin against the Holy Spirit is quite different from that by which the Lord
Jesus is denied, yet Novatian, to close the door of forgiveness to this last
sin, confuses sin against the Holy Spirit with the one who denies the Lord, to
cut off from this confusion the fruit of penance with the hope of forgiveness. If
to deny the Lord is to sin against the Holy Spirit, those who are guilty of
this denial cannot hope for any forgiveness, any fruit of their penance, since
the Lord declares that this sin cannot be put back in this world, neither in
the other. Novation therefore commits an act of duplicity by exhorting to do
penance, for why this penance if it denies that sin can be erased? It is the
groans, the tears, the complaints of repentance that get the sinner forgiveness
and the change of life. It is because David repented and confessed his sin that
he deserved his pardon and returned to all his old rights, for he remained on
the throne and was endowed with prophetic spirit. (2 Sam. 12:13) Scripture
gives us certain proofs; we see in the 50th Psalm his repentance and after the
persecution directed against him by his son his prophetic oracles, because
historically the third Psalm comes after the 50th. Shall we say that it was
necessary to grant pardon to a king, but that we must not forgive people of a
more humble condition? And it is not rather to those who have the power of
sharing that it is necessary to forgive more with difficulty, for God does not
respect people. (Rom. 2:11) The more dignified one becomes, the more serious
the fault becomes, however slight it may appear in itself. Just as humility in
the influential ones of the earth, participates in the elevation and brilliance
of their position, so their faults are much more reprehensible. Not to mention
the sin that is forbidden to all men; there are things which are permitted to
persons of a more obscure condition, and who are not so to those who are
elevated in dignity. Thus they cannot without inconvenience neither trade nor
enter a low-class eating house. A senator cannot also be interested without
losing his dignity. Now, if those who commit these slight improprieties are
worthy of blame, how much more are they reprehensible if they are guilty of
real faults? We must conclude from this that the crime of David was extremely
serious and from a double point of view; however, his repentance won him the
pardon of his homicide and adultery, and more importantly, his tears deserved a
new life. When the prophet Nathan came to him, David dared not hide his crime,
he confessed publicly, saying, "I have sinned against the Lord." And
the Prophet replied, "The Lord has forgiven you your sin, and you do not die,
because you have repented.” (2 Sam. 12:13) And as we then see him prophesied,
there is no doubt that he has completely changed his life. See again Achab; the
Prophet reproached him for the death of Naboth; This prince shed tears, he
tears his clothes, he puts on a hair shirt, and the Lord speaks to Elijah and
says to him: "Have you not seen Ahab humbled before me? I will not bring
upon him in his days the evils of which I have threatened him." (1 Kgs.
21:27) The Ninevites mourn their crimes, and God saves them from death hanging
over their heads and gives them life. (Jonah 3:5) These are the abundant fruits
of penance, but this objection is made: Yes, God forgave, but not to the sin of
idolatry, for however great these crimes may be, they are not so great as the
crime of idolatry. The assertion of Novatian, who admits penitence for two
enormous crimes, is thus largely destroyed, for if fornication is unworthy of
pardon, as Novatian asserts, how much more homicide and adultery; but what
brings out all the futility of his opinion is that he grants pardon to crimes
which, by the admission of all, have a much greater gravity. Let us now examine
whether God has promised to forgive idolaters. All that is not legitimately forgiven
in this life will not be forgiven in the other. It is here below, as Our Lord
declares, that sins are bound or loosed (Matt. 16:19); in the other life there
will be only reward or condemnation. Every man justly condemned here below
cannot hope to be admitted to the number of the elect in the other life. Let us
hear what the Lord says about the idolaters to the prophet Jeremiah: "Go
and make these words heard. Return to me, O people of Israel, says the Lord,
and I will not hold my face against you, because I am merciful, says the Lord,
and I will not be angry with you forever. But acknowledge your iniquity, you
have committed ungodliness, you have directed your paths to foreign gods under
all trees laden with foliage.” (Jer. 3:12-13) These are the promises that God
makes to those who become converted after their fall; if they return to him
after their apostasy, he forgives them of their sins. Here is what Jeremiah
says: "My most delicate children have walked in difficult ways; they were
brought as a flock delivered to his enemies. Do not be afraid, my children, and
cry to the Lord, for he who has led you will remember you. As your mind has
made you wander far from God, on returning to him you will seek him with ten
times more ardor; for he that brought upon you these evils shall fill you with
everlasting joy in saving you." (Baruch 4:26) Oh, how great is the
goodness of God, how it excites those who have fallen. As it urges the idol
worshipers to return to him, as a tender father, he promises his children the
eternal joy of salvation if they consent to change their lives. We still read
in the same Prophet: “and I will bring them back to this land, I will restore
them and I will not destroy them, I will plant them and tear them no
more." (Jer. 24:6) This threat he had made: “He who will sacrifice to
foreign gods will uprooted," could bring down into despair those who had
been guilty of this ungodliness, if those who had sacrificed to idols could not
be replanted, he therefore exhorts them to repent if they want to return to
their first state. If the sin is not expiated, the sentence remains. God made
the Ninevites announce that in three days their city would be destroyed. (Jonah
3:4) Why in three days? to give them time to repent and revoke this sentence,
or that if they persevered in their impiety, their ruin was even more just.
This is what God says through his Prophet: "I do not want the death of the
fisherman, but rather that he will convert and live." (Ezek. 18:32) This
is why penance came to the Ninevites the forgiveness of the sins that were to
be the cause of their death. Why did Noah take a hundred years to build the ark?
(Gen. 6:3) It was so that those who saw him and heard from his mouth the danger
which threatened them, had time to recognize themselves. God does not want
anyone to perish. "The Lord,” said Solomon, “pities those who
repent." (Eccl. 12:3) And in another place: "You have mercy on all
men, because you can do anything, and you hide their sins because of
repentance." (Wis. 11:24) It is in this same feeling that Our Lord, deeply
saddened by the perfidy of the Jews, exclaims: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem who
slay the prophets and stone those who are sent to you, how many times did I
want to gather your children, as a hen gathers her little ones under her wings,
and you did not want it." (Matt. 23:37) The Lord in all the course of the
law therefore never ceases to exhort sinners to convert, because he does not
want his work to perish. The only purpose which he proposed, in giving the law,
was to bring men back to the truth, with the difference, however, that under
the New Testament the author of the law is more merciful because He wanted his
mercy to be fuller and more abundant at the time when his Son Our Lord deigned
to manifest himself to men in his incarnation, so that the preaching of the Son
might be more fruitful in grace than that of the servants. It was just and
worthy, indeed, that the Son was for men the source of graces more abundant
than the servants had been. So he immediately condemns all sins to those who
convert and who believe in him, without even demanding the groans of penance.
What makes the Apostle say: "The gifts and the vocation of God are without
penance.” (Rom. 9:29) If they come to sin afterwards, they may deserve their
pardon through penitence; for it is just that, having sinned after having
received mercy, it is no longer given to them with so much liberality, but that
they can obtain their pardon only by moans and tears. It is impossible for man
not to sin. Let us listen to the apostle Saint John: "If we say that we
are without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we
confess our sins, He is faithful and just to deliver them and to cleanse us of
all unrighteousness.” (1 Jn. 1:8) Thus did David, by the admission of his sin,
merit his forgiveness and the grace of a new life. It is certainly to
Christians that St. John speaks here, for he adds a little lower: "My
little children, I write this to you, that you may not sin. However, if someone
happens to sin, we have Jesus Christ as advocate with the Father.” (1 Jn. 2:1)
The Apostle reminds us of this truth, so that if we come to sin after our
baptism, we humbly beg our advocate to pray for us to his Father. If penance
existed under the old law, how would it have lost its strength under the new
law which is as good as the first a law of mercy? How will God, who has pitied
his enemies by calling them to the benefit of grace, show mercy to his friends
to reward them (for the tribulation of the heart is the reward of repentance)?
If it were otherwise, men would have reason to sadden themselves for having
ceased to be the enemies of God to become his friends. What idea would we have
of God, if he had mercy on his enemies without demanding penance, and refused
it to his repentant friends? Moreover, the Lord knows that the devil attacks
the friends and servants of God with more violence and perseverance, as the
Apostle Saint Peter recalls in these terms: "Be sober and watch, because
the devil your enemy moves around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to
devour.” (1 Pet. 5:8) He knows we have to to fight against an enemy whose
cruelty equals strength; if, therefore, we come to be conquered, he wants us to
seek refuge in his powerful protection; he has compassion for the sad state in
which we are reduced, and puts on his strength so that we can resist with new
courage. As if the days of which the Lord spoke were not abridged (Matt.
24:22), all flesh would be destroyed; thus no one can be saved if men are
closed to the ways of penance. If no one, says the Holy Spirit, can boast of
having a pure heart (Prov. 20:9); if no one, as he says elsewhere, is
undefiled, not even the child whose life is only one day (Job 19:4), who can
escape the justice of God, if the value of penance is contested? And what do
these words of the Lord become: "That there will be joy in heaven for a
sinner who does penance?” (Luke 15:7) But great crimes, says Novatian, are
unworthy of forgiveness, for example fornication and idolatry, and what will become
of this word of the Lord, where he promises that all sins, all blasphemies will
be handed to men? "Blasphemy alone against the Holy Spirit will not be
forgiven them." (Matt. 12:31) According to this testimony of the Savior,
all sins will be forgiven except one. Choose now, Novatian, and say to whom
these words apply; Is it to those who do not believe yet, or to those who have
embraced the faith? If it be to those who do not believe, how are they forgiven
of sins, though it is certain that before believing in God, they have sinned
against God and the Holy Spirit?<span>  </span></font><font size="3">Some of
them, in fact, treat the Savior's actions with magical operations, and ascribe
to demons the works of the Holy Spirit. If you apply these words to the
faithful, your assertion is destroyed because "all sins will be forgiven;
and whosoever shall speak against the son of man, he shall be forgiven."
(Matt. 13:12) Any sin against God or against Jesus Christ will be forgiven of
men; for the Savior understood them all except the sin against the Holy Spirit.
He does not here confound the sin against God with the sin against the Holy
Spirit, for if it were his intention, he would not have nominally excepted this
sin. He therefore wanted to signify another sin by this blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit (and here we must understand the person and not the nature of the
Holy Spirit); therefore all sins will be delivered either by means of penance
to those who believe, or by baptism to those who are ready to embrace the
faith. As for the sin that the Jews committed against the Holy Spirit, it is of
another kind in relation to the time in which they lived. Our Lord declares
that this sin will not be forgiven them in this life or the other; for it is
not by error, but by malice, that they have sinned against the Holy Spirit. They
knew from their understanding that the works of the Savior were the works of
God, and to distract the people from believing in him they attributed them to
the prince of demons. This is why Our Lord said to them, "for you have
taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered
those who were entering." (Luke 11:52) This sentence has therefore been
pronounced against malevolent spirits who have no longer any hope of salvation.
For nothing is more enormous than this crime, for it pretends to present as
false what it knows to be the truth under the law of God, and to whom Christ
had been promised, saw the wonders which he performed, and recognized in him
the fulfillment of the promises which God had made to them, but jealousy
blinded them to the point of denying them the truth of these wonders, even
more, even to persecute him and put him to death, so it is not right that this
sin be ever given to them, since at the very judgment of their conscience they
have dared to resist God, whose faithful servants they called themselves, but
the sins against God or against Jesus Christ have different causes. So you envy
the happiness of others, the pain of your darkness makes you exhale complaints
against the Creator; or a sudden misfortune that melt on you excites your anger
and makes you unfair to your Father. It is same as the incarnation of Jesus
Christ leads to insult God. In ignorance where they are of the mystery of
Christ incarnate, they are the object of their blasphemies, and regard it as
unworthy that the Son of God, who is of an incorporeal and simple nature, has
consented to be born as an ordinary man. </font><span><font size="3"> </font></span><font size="3">They blaspheme this mystery because they do
not know it. So they must be reached when they convert, because they are
against the truth, while believing to defend their interests. After being
tested and disarmed, they proclaim the truth of what they were doing. But for
the Jews of whom we have spoken, their feelings as their actions have been very
different; without another judge and without any other executioner, they are
tormented and punished by the testimony of their own conscience. The one whom
error makes enemies of the truth, comes to be converted, he rejoices to have
known the truth; but for the evil spirit he has nothing he can correct; for if
he converts, he will recognize as true what he previously knew was false. But
as for the Holy Spirit, there is no reason for injustice to him; his action
cannot displease anyone, since it is revealed only in the power that works
miracles and wonders. Who would dare to attack him on seeing him raise the
dead? Who would dare to be angry with him when he sees that his power renders
movement to the paralyzed, sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf? How rather
not to love the one whom he sees driving away foul spirits, to purify the
lepers, and to heal all the ills? However, the Jews preferred to outrage him by
attributing his works to the demons, because they thus found the means of
appeasing their hatred and their envy against the Savior. So he declares that
this sin will not be forgiven them in this world or the other. But Novatian
claims that larger crimes are handed over after baptism, and he cites idolatry
and fornication by name. All sins, he says, are set in baptism; but if the
faithful then come to commit a grave error, they have no more pardon to hope
for, because after having received the Holy Spirit, one must no longer sin
against the Holy Spirit. Who will deny that one should never sin, if it were
possible? But God, who knew the fragility of the human race, has always
prepared for men salutary remedies, where they would find a way to recover from
their falls. If, on the contrary, the Holy Spirit forbids giving sinners the
benefit of penance, we come to doubt of Divine Providence under the new
covenant, and those who lived under the old will appear much more favored,
since this remedy they were not refused. And how then will grace be more
abundant under the New Testament than under the Old? God would have treated men
as enemies, if, knowing that penance was for them an indispensable condition of
salvation, he would have given them the Holy Spirit, but without any hope of
forgiveness or reparation, if they came to offend by the effect of fear or
error. He would have looked for an opportunity to lose men rather than save
them. But far from us this thought, for Our Lord said: "The Son of man did
not come to lose souls, but to save them.” (Luke 9:56) If God makes it our duty
to forgive us up to seventy times seven times the sins we commit against each
other, on the sole condition that we repent (Matt. 18:22), how much more will
he forgive those who have offended him and come back to him? God wants the
conversion of every sinner. The Apostle teaches us that forgiveness was granted
to the fornicators and filthy, when he said, "and I may have to mourn over
many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity,
immorality, and licentiousness which they have practiced.” (2 Cor. 12:21) He
thus proves that some who are for him a subject not of sadness but of joy, have
done penance for these crimes; some others, on the contrary, have not made
penance of their fornications, which is why the Apostle weeps, because their
impenitence has closed the doors of life to them. For if the penance of these
crimes should last all this life, he would not say that he weeps because they
have not done, but because they do not do penance. But because he knows that
penance begins and ends here, he purposely says, "They have not done
penance." He wanted that by coming to find them he could have peace by
entering into communion with them. Here is a proof that we can be in communion
with the fornicators after they have done penance, One cannot communicate with
them as long as they do penance, this communion is permitted only when they
cease to be subject to the judgment of the Church. It remains to be seen
whether we can establish that forgiveness should be given especially to
idolaters, and we read in the Apocalypse of the apostle St. John that penance
is preached to the bishops to whom he gives the name of angels, that is to say,
of envoys, in the same sense that St. Paul says to the Galatians: "You
have received me as an angel of God” (Gal. 4:14), receive the order to admit
the sinner to penance, and do not leave without warning about those who are
stumbling blocks who bring scandal in the Church, since they themselves are of
the Church. Here is what is said to St. John: ""And to the angel of
the church in Pergamum write: `The words of him who has the sharp two-edged
sword. I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; you hold fast my name
and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my witness, my
faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. But I have a few
things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who
taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, that they
might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality. So you also have
some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.” (Rev. 2:12 etc.) This doctrine
of the Nicolaites was similar to that of Balaam, that is to say, a compound of
idolatry and fornication (Num. 24:14, 25: 2), and he commanded to do penance.
Now he speaks to those who are part of the Church, as these words prove:
"This is what the Spirit says to the churches," and he indicates what
will be the fruit of penance: he says, “I will give to him who conquers I will
give some of the hidden manna,” that penance might make him victorious over his
sins. What is, in fact, true repentance, in the grief of the faults committed
with the firmest intention? to stop committing them in the future? "And
again to the angel of the church of Thyatira write, This is the saying of the
Son of God, whose eyes are like flames of fire, and their feet like the finest
brass. I know your works, your charity, the care you take for the poor, your
patience and your last works more abundant than the first. But I have something
to reproach you for: you allow Jezebel, this woman who calls herself a
prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants, to lead them into fornication and
to make them eat meats sacrificed to idols. I gave her a time to do penance,
and she does not want to repent of her prostitution. Behold, I will reduce her
to her bed, and those who commit adultery with her will be in great affliction
if they do not do penance for their works. I will strike her children with
death, and all the churches will know that I am he who searches the reins and
the hearts, and I will render to each of you according to his works. But I say
to you and to the others who are at Thyatira, to all who do not follow this
doctrine, and who, according to their language, do not know the depths of
Satan; I will not put any other weight on you. However, keep what you have
until I come. He who will be victorious and keep my works until the end, I will
give him power over the nations.” In this single letter to the Church of
Thyatira, he confounds and condemns the double error of the Novatian heresy; he
promises the fruits of penance to those who repent of their idolatry, and he
shows that in the same church the contact of the wicked does not defile the
good, since they are part of the same communion; for it is not to those outside
the church that he wrote: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says to the churches.” It is in the same sense that St. Paul said: "We
know that all that the law says is to those who are under the law that it says
it.” (Rom. 3:19) And in another place: "Why would I want to judge those
who are out of the Church?" (1 Cor. 6:12) The Son of God through the mouth
of Saint John, therefore, it is addressed to the members of the same church to
exhort some to penance and to give the others the praise they deserve:
"But I say to you, and to the rest of you are in Thyatira, to all who do
not follow this doctrine, that is, the doctrine of idolatry: "Keep what
you have unceasing until I come," (Rev. 2:24), that is, persevere until
the end, for whoever perseveres until the end will be saved." (Matt.
10:22) For the same reason, he who persevered in evil will be condemned. Thus,
justly, the righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day when
he departs from the right path. In the same way the iniquity of the sinner will
not hurt him, as soon as he becomes a convert. This is why God says through his
prophet, "He who sacrifices to the gods will be uprooted, but if he
converts, he will live.” Our Lord expresses the truth when he says, "He
who denies me, I will deny him.” (Matt. 10:33) But if he converts he cannot be
denied by him whom he has publicly confessed. This is why the Psalmist said:
"No living man will be justified in your presence.” (Ps. 142:2) For every
man is judged according to the state in which he died. God Himself teaches us
that in the Church the wicked are mingled with the good until the day of
judgment. "The kingdom of heaven," says he, "is like a net
thrown into the sea, and contains all kinds of fish, and when they sat down on
the shore, they will gather the good in a vessel, and cast out the wicked, so
it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come out and separate from
the kingdom of God all scandals and all those who commit iniquity." (Matt.
13:47) The same truth is expressed to us in this man who is surprised among
those who were at table, not having the wedding garment." (Matt. 22:12) He
is the only one who is rejected from the bosom of the Church, because the crime
of his indignity does not defile others, he is known to all of them because the
cause of this indignity is expressed, that is, say the defect of the wedding garment.
Indeed, they all saw him wearing a garment different from that of other guests.
This is what makes St. Paul say: "In a great house there are not only
vases of gold and silver, but also of wood and glass." (2 Tim. 2:20) Spoke
thus because of Hymenaeus and Philetus, who, while part of the Church,
professed grave errors in the resurrection, and even denied it, like some of
the faithful of the Church of Corinth: Novation claims that by this house one
must understand the world and not the Church, for fear of being forced to admit
into the same Church the mixture of the good and the bad, those who are pure
with those who are not. They are not, but it is easy to reverse this
interpretation. For in one house all are under the same name, and although they
are of different customs, they are all known by the name of their master. The world,
on the contrary, contains men of opposite professions, until they recognize
gods and masters quite different. You see, then, that these words must be
understood, not of the world, but of the Church in which those who live under
one name lead a very different life. I am convinced that Novatian was not
ignorant of this truth; but as he could not motivate his separation on just
complaints; to escape a certain shame, he asked a false interpretation of the
law for some bad reasons by which he tries to excuse and cover up his hatred
and malignity. Here is what he answers to what we have just said: I do not deny
that we must admit to penitence those who are guilty of idolatry, but I dare
not say that this sin will be forgiven them, because it can only be forgiven by
the one against whom it has been committed. This answer is full of bad faith,
these interpretations discover and update its deceits. When he comes to tell
us: It is written, "He who denies me, I will deny him.” (Matt. 10:33),
words out of a mouth that cannot lie, he declares vain and unsuccessful penance
from which he maintains the obligation. If the sentence has been pronounced,
and by a mouth that cannot deceive, why necessarily impose on man the torture
of moans and tears, you who deny its value, or who confess not to know it. Any
man who gives advice to another, gives it with the clear intention that he can
take advantage of it. But at home, Novatian, this confession is not sincere,
and it is for you to play the minds of men that you say that we must do
penance. You know perfectly well that this truth cannot be denied; you then
resort to subtleties to cancel the penance not of mouth, but in reality. You
declare that every man who sacrificed to idols commits sin against the Holy
Spirit, a sin which, according to the words of the Gospel, you claim to have to
be handed over neither in this world nor in the other. Why then say that we
must do penance for this sin? Is it not obviously to make illusion. as I
demonstrated. You are still trying to hide your character under other
artifacts; you say that it is in the same sense that the Apostle St. Peter said
to Simon: “and do penance for such a great sin, that God may forgive you, if it
be possible.” (Acts 8:22) But Peter considered the hardened malice, full of
venom and bitterness of this man, and that is why he does not give him a
certain promise. For what man has ever been so far as to want to buy the gift
of God for money? This answer was therefore made to malignity rather than
error. This malignity is without remedy because it cannot be excused either for
error or for the necessity of being pardoned by the tears of penance. Let those
who are guilty of the same crime hear the words that Peter addresses to Simon.
That is why he gives him a dubious answer, because, he adds, “I see that you
are full of a bitter affair, and bound to iniquity." So if after such a
huge crime, Peter, however, gives a dubious answer, and no doubt God forgives
those who have been dragged into sin by error or necessity, if they do a proper
penance. He has given his Church the right of admitting to penance and after
penance to reconciliation. Novatian still blames us. Why, he says, is the body
of the Lord given to those who are known to be sinners? Can those who are
judges be accusers? They should be accused and they should be known, and then
they can be separated from the communion of the faithful, but what judge never
takes on the role of accuser? The Lord Himself defiled in his company by Judas,
whom he knew to be a thief who stole the alms given to him, and he did not send
him away because no one accused him; Should we not imitate this example, and
not reject the Church whose crime has not been publicly disclosed?</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Now I speak to the consciousness of Novation,
who never ceases to accuse us, and I beseech him to tell me if he is certain of
the holiness of all those who are with him. His anger against us goes so far
that he even refuses us the title of Christians, although he knows that we have
received this faith which he claims to have to the exclusion of others. What
makes the Christian is belief and life. If, then, you see a man profess the
same faith as you, and live in the same way, why refuse him to be what you are
yourself? It is certain that he who says: Jesus is the Lord, says it by the
Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3), because he speaks the truth; but all truth comes
from God. Why do not you go to the one who speaks the truth, and answer him
only by your negations? This is not the reason, it is the anger that
contradicts here who makes profession to believe in God. Do you not declare to
yourself the enemy of God, declaring yourself against him whose faith in God is
according to the truth? Is a pagan who hears a man claim that idols are gods,
deny that he is a heathen? Why challenge the title of Christian to one who
professes true faith, while St. Paul says to you: "We must believe in our
hearts to obtain justice, and confess with our mouths to obtain salvation.” (Rom.
10:10) But you, driven by a secret hostility on which your anger blinds you,
oppose God by denying that he who confesses by mouth can obtain salvation
against this formal declaration of the Lord: "Whoever confess me before
men, I will confess him myself.” (Luke 12:8) Did he say: If Novatian confesses
to me? And yet, you formulate your assertions as if you had to defend only one
thing, it is that to be saved it is not enough to be a Christian, it must be
Novation. But if, on the contrary, the public profession of faith in Jesus
Christ is sufficient to obtain salvation, wherever this profession is found, it
produces this fruit of salvation. If the tradition of this faith has been
corrupted among us, if the meaning has been altered, you are right to accuse
us. If, on the contrary, it is wholly in us as it is in you, in denying us you
deny yourself. But you accuse the ministers of faith; Suppose your accusation
is well-founded, though you cannot prove it, yet have those who have received
from them the teachings of faith learned the truth or the lie? The truth spoken
by a vicious man is none the less the truth, for faith and works are two
different things. What does the persecutor of the Christian name pursue from
his hatred? It is the profession of faith and not life. He knows that nothing
is more advantageous to religion than the profession we make of being
Christians, and this sacrilegious persecutor believes in </font><span><font size="3"> </font></span><font size="3">this profession, which he does not want to
hear because it is hated by him. But you, who profess the same religion and
bear the same character, refuse to believe in the confession that we make of
the truths that you confess yourself. If you are certain that we are born to a
new life, all other than you were born yourself, you would be right to believe
that we are not what you are. Why am I the object of sacrilegious persecution
if I am not what you are? For if I professed what you attribute to me, I would
not be subject to persecution. In short, I believe in what concerns me rather
than you. This is my statement that the judge asks, not yours when it comes to
me. Why then challenge this statement when in this matter, by the confession of
all, it is not a foreign testimony, but my personal statement that is asked
either for me or against me? I did not want to turn against you for a simple
name, to see if you would be falsely against me when my profession of faith
would be true to the truth, or as if we did not know who to relate to. You act
in bad faith here to correct your schism; for you are not ignorant that here it
is my testimony that one is asking, and not a foreign attestation, and that one
will regard as true what I have confessed, and not what another has denied. It
is also certain that we must recognize the liberty of those who, led by the
love of Jesus Christ, without examining the actions of men, hasten to embrace the
faith, contenting themselves with approving in themselves what they know how to
be useful to them, that is to say the true teaching of faith in Jesus Christ.
Whoever believes that man needs anything else apart from the mystery of faith,
insults him, it is an insult to tradition and does not have the feelings it
should have on the grace of God. By demanding the personal merit of man for the
gift of God to be useful to the one who receives it, he makes man a being
superior or equal to the tradition of faith, whereas, however, man is far from
deserving such a title. Here is what St. Paul says about this same matter:
"I planted, Apollo watered, but God gave increase. Now, he who plants is
nothing, neither is he who waters, but it is God who gives increase.” (1 Cor.
3:6) What can we expect from man here, since he himself has received the
teachings he transmits? Let us examine then what advantages will result from
his holy life, or what infuriating effects of his guilty conduct. He who
introduces himself desires to hear the words of God, and by believing in them
he firmly believes that he will be saved. What does the good or bad life of one
who transmits the teachings of faith do here? Only one thing is necessary; it
is the living faith that inspires the person who receives it to believe with
all his heart what he has heard. That the life of the one who teaches is
reprehensible, will it be an obstacle for the one who listens? Will it prevent
him from believing in the truths he teaches, and will the sin of the master
enter the disciple's heart to close him to faith? Or will God, who is
righteous, disdain a man who is devoted to him because of the sin of him whom
he bears to see in dignity? But the man himself does not judge it in this way,
although he is often deceived or likes to please. If it were so, and man was
obliged to defend his cause, would he not have the right to say to God: I do
not know him who is the cause of the scorn you show me? It is to find that I
approached him because he was your priest; it is you that I have sought, you
whom I have desired, you who have believed; I have not expected anything from
the man, why should I be responsible for the bad dispositions of a man whom I
would not have known if I had not looked for you? If his virtues had been
useful to me, it might perhaps be fair to say that his vices were hurtful to
me. But no, the virtues would not have served me anything if my faith had been
doubtful, and I have nothing to do with it to fear his vices. Now, my faith is
what it must be; I have faith in teachings that come from you, that make you
love, that speak about you and your promises; neither his speeches nor his
actions have been the motive or the object of my faith, but it is to the faith
that comes from you that I have given myself entirely. According to these
principles, the conduct of the true faithful is irreproachable. Suppose the
priests are lawyers, will the bad life of a lawyer be a cause of conviction for
his client? The duty of the lawyer is to defend the cause of his client
according to the rules of law; but how unjust is his life, how can it harm the
cause he supports? The lawyer's person cannot do good or bad here, the good or
bad cause that he defends will determine the judgment that will be made. It is
the same with those who want to become Christians, they come to find the
priest, express their desires to him, and he gives them the teachings
prescribed by the rules of the Church; if these desires are true, the judge
welcomes them; in what way can the priest here be useful or harmful, while he
does not even know the cause of his client? God, who is his judge, is the only
one who knows what he is, in what arrangements he approaches him. The duty of
the priest is to fulfill here the office entrusted to him, that of the judge,
to welcome or reject the cause of his client. Is it not he who said in the
Gospel, "My daughter, did your faith save you?” (Matt. 9:22) So it is not
to any foreign help whatsoever, it is to the faith that the salvation of each
one is attached, because God has established that faith, if it is firm, would
get everything he wanted. You, on the contrary, come not as a friend, but as an
enemy of Christ to gather the people under your name; they cannot be Christians
if they are not Novatians, while the Apostle condemns those who say they belong
to Paul or to another. But you, who believe you to be superior, place your name
above that of Jesus Christ, as if he does not suffice to defend his own Church.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I do not see why the pagans dare to
declare war on us, or to attack our faith, while they think themselves safe
from all reproach and attack. For they produce no proof in support of
assertions, I will say rather of their superstition than of their religion.
They affirm things which are nothing less than certain, in order to pass, it
seems, for the authors and defenders of new doctrines. In the first place, they
claim to adore many gods, and they give no proof, no testimony of their
existence. They call gods even those who have not dared to usurp the name, that
is to say that are the men who make the gods, while it is God who is the
Creator of men, and therefore their assertion is vain and of no weight.
Everything that is done outside of God has no stability. The proof of what I
say is in their books, where we see God completely alien to their religious
institutions. We see men led by different motives, establishing sacrifices in
honor of false deities, and thus men without merit were regarded as worthy
authors of such institutions. Now, since those whom they call god have not made
to them on this point any command, of what authority do they establish, do they
present as worthy and commendable a worship which they cannot prove to have
been commanded to them? Assuming that they could produce an order they would
have received, it would be necessary to examine first of all whether there is
an obligation, whether it is expedient to obey those whose divinity cannot be
established by any sign, by no wonder. Beaten on this point, they take refuge
in the elements and claim that they are the object of their worship, because
their influence is all powerful in the direction of human life. Here again I
will ask them, as before, whether they have received an order, a commandment
from God, of which they themselves confess grandeur and power, although they
take no account of it. If one owes a cult to the elements, it is necessary that
this cult was commanded by the one that one recognizes for the creator of the
elements. If they cannot produce this order, it is a reckless presumption, and
a presumption worthy of punishment rather than reward; for it is a contempt for
the Creator that the servants receive the homage that is refused to their
master, and that the people of the emperor's suite are made to adore the
contempt of the emperor himself. How can they hope for impunity here, whereas
in this very life we ​​see this audacity severely punished? Will they say that
they have received the order of the elements themselves? Let them show this
order and tell us the words that these elements would have addressed to them.
Now, if they cannot produce this order, what punishments are not worthy of the
proven authors of this religion of presumption and falsehood? We cannot
attribute this impiety to the elements. The stars of the body will accuse them
of God's tribunal, declaring that they have by no means been the authors of this
impious and vain inspiration. In the same way, when those who are only men and
whom they call gods will be delivered to the just punishments which their sins
deserve, they will maintain that they are not guilty of anything here, and will
lay all the responsibility for this crime of idolatry on those who, without
having received the order, began to render them divine honors. How dare they
attack our faith, treat it as an object of mockery, as they see our law
supported by irreconcilable testimony, and read this statement of Our Lord
Himself and our God: “I am the Lord, and there are no others.” (Isa. 45:6) If
he had been content with this statement, we could have refused to believe it so
as not to resemble the pagans who, without seeing any proof of the power of
their gods, worshiped them and, what is worse, rendered them an unholy cult. We
blush to reveal the shameful things that are done there, and they call
themselves wise, because their law plays them as an impostor. As for our God he
commanded men to worship him, but after giving proof of his power, and to leave
them no doubt, he gave them a pure law, holy and worthy of God. For us the
pagans are foolish, we would not have believed in our God, if He had not given
us testimonies of His power, and we would not have received His law if we had
not recognized that it was pure and worthy of our obedience. So nothing in us
is done in darkness or in secret. For all that is honest does not fear
publicity; what shudders decency and virtue is ashamed to happen in the open.
That is why pagans celebrate their mysteries in darkness, and in this they all
act of prudence. They blush to face the jeers of the public, and they do not
want to divulge the abominations they perform as one of the prescriptions of
their law, for fear that these men who call themselves wise do not pass for
extravagant in the eyes of those whom they accuse of madness. Perhaps, in fact,
they regard us as foolish, because our law preaches chastity, mercy, piety,
continence, all things that are so extravagant to them, for every virtuous man
passes for bad in the eyes of the wicked, and the prudent the man is accused of
madness by the fool. Chastity is so much in their horror that the degenerate
are their delights, they take them for masters, and they are not worthy of
their religion, if I may give it that name, so long as they become like them.
That is why they submit to the operation of castration and change their habit
as to change their sex, they lend themselves to unnatural actions, like women, and
only then are they worthy and perfect ministers of their superstition. Can one
accuse someone who becomes such only by virtue of his law? He renounces the
prerogatives and the clothing of the man and transforms himself into a woman to
lend himself in all pride to womanish actions. What must we think of these
mysteries, which change honesty in reverse and innocence into corruption, while
true religion replaces in men indecency by modesty and licentiousness by
modesty? How can the partisans of this religion be virtuous when the mysteries
of their law can be celebrated only in the company of the womanish men? If
their law allows these disorders, and has them pleasant, it is crime, it is
folly to refuse to take part. So they treat us as foolish, for the wise in
their eyes are those who practice this filthy cult and the foolish who flee
with horror. And it is here that they show fineness and deceptions. They
decorate their law with the name of wisdom to cover all that is reprehensible,
because the blame cannot fall on the wisdom. They treat, on the contrary, our
law of madness to drive away men. But leave aside these names of wisdom and
madness; let us repress this spirit of rivalry which the defense of two
opposing parties always engenders, and put the two laws in the presence of one
another so that we can clearly see where wisdom is, where madness is. What! the
sign of the cross alone imposes silence on paganism. In the presence of what
they call a madness, their wisdom is silent, their victims dare not answer.
Their entrails remain silent and mute out of respect for the majesty of the
Christian religion. Is it not a wonder that what they decorate with the name of
wisdom trembles before what they treat of madness? Let us now compare the very
content of these two laws. The pagans admit in their writings that they adore
gods and goddesses, and they say true, because they render divine honors to
divinities of both sexes. Janus and Saturn, Jupiter and Mercury, Apollo, etc.;
on the other hand, Minerva, Isis, Fruxilla, Venus, Flora the courtesan, etc.
are as many gods and goddesses as the stories of the Greeks and Romans attest. The
Christians whom they treat as fools are less rich; they adore in the mystery of
divinity only one God, the principle of all things, and they grant divine
honors to none of the things he created. They are convinced that it alone and
amply suffices for salvation, and they know that they outrage it by attributing
to others its glory and its name; and indeed, no sovereign allows one to
confound with him his tribunes and his officers. Now compare these two laws;
where is wisdom here? in the law that adores the Creator or the one who adores
the creature? in the law which prostrates itself only before the Lord, or in
that which prostitutes the divine honors to his servants? Can it be that in a
house there are two masters? and how can pagans, versed in judicial expertise,
and who claim to be wise men, in the same world created by one and the same
God, adore an infinite number of gods and goddesses? They give the name of gods
to those who rule and govern the world, whereas they do not believe in providence.
Now, the pronouncement of a wicked doctrine is an act of improvidence and
madness. God must necessarily avenge his outraged glory against those who dare
to attribute to their fellow-creatures the name and prerogatives of the
Godhead. Let's move on to what each of these laws says. Our law, which they
treat as foolish, makes it a duty to choose for pontiffs and altar ministers
only men of pure manners, of a holy and irreproachable life; the tradition of
the pagans, on the other hand, requires that one be fit to become priests and
ministers of their divinities only on the condition that men become women, in
order to be able to lend themselves more freely to feminine acts. This is how
we see them shake their hair indecently in the bath, and make an angry voice
sound, hail and dissolute. If they dared to commit themselves in public to
these excesses, they would be stoned by all the people. And what about that
Cynocephalus (Anubis) who is always wandering and who seeks in every place the
scattered members of the adulterous Osiris, husband of Isis? It is with such
ministers, it is in the school of such masters that these pagans dare to adorn
themselves with the name of sages, whereas far from finding in them the shadow
of wisdom, we meet only the crime. Nothing is more fatal, indeed, than to love
the obscenities and depravities of vice. What shall I say of the shameful
scenes which take place in the caves where they hide their eyes? To escape from
the shame of the obscenities with which the blistering is printed on them, they
are blindfolded; some flap their wings like birds, imitating the voice of the
raven, others sound the roar of lions; others, hands tied with the intestines
of young horses, are thrown on pits full of water; one of them approaches with
a sword, cuts the knots formed by these intestines, and proclaims himself their
liberator. Other actions are more obscene yet. See how degrading depravities are
the victim of these men who decree the name of wise men. Because these shameful
scenes are accomplished in the shadows, they imagine that they cannot be known.
But the holy Christian faith has revealed and brought to light all those
mysteries of iniquity that vicious and degraded men have invented and
accomplished in secret. When this faith was preached, those who heard it,
delighted with this doctrine of virtue and holiness, hastened to embrace it and
to abandon these secret mysteries of shame and disgrace, they confessed that
they had been the victim of ignorance. Almost all of them were victims of this
guilty error, and they looked at each other as wise, because there was no one
who took them back. For although all were deceived in the deceitful ways of the
same idolatry, however, each had made a cult adapted to his tastes and his
habits, so that one and the same mistake took different forms, according to the
customs and the immoral life of those who established it. Thus the called
mysteries of Bacchus are the triumph of pessimism and shame joined to the
excesses of fury. Fornication, indeed, rarely goes without anger; everywhere
else with Bacchus we see represented Priapus, with whom he had an infamous
commerce. All other mysteries are of the same kind, but Satan used his ordinary
finesses and tricks to catch men in these shameful nets. It was already under
his inspiration that men had established these unclean mysteries; but when they
were established, he overlaid them with certain prestige calculated to seduce
men and lead them into error. Thus the tradition of antiquity served as a
passport to lies, and an excuse for these shameful inventions. By force of
habit, we no longer consider as shameful what was the height of shame. In fact,
a first outrage makes one blush, but the habit imperceptibly softens the
repulsive features of vice, and the forehead becomes hardened to shame,
especially if one is surrounded by a large number of accomplices. Indeed, it is
a conquest for shame when it manages to imprint its stain on individuals of
distinction that easily find imitators. If for so many centuries they have been
able to cover themselves with the name of sages, because there was no voice to
condemn these overwhelming inventions; today, that thanks to the mercy of God,
light has been made for the human race, that it condemns as a crime what was
then regarded as a law, and presents to men as true wisdom what then it was a
madness, they should stop wearing this name, give up persevering in infamies
that are brought to light, and recognize that they are unworthy of the name of
wise. But, on the contrary, to put the finishing touch to their folly of which
they are convinced, they continue to treat fools who expose their extravagance.
They accuse our faith and its late appearance on earth; as for the precepts
imposed on us, they admit that they are irreproachable. But the accusation they
make against our faith is less against us than against its divine author. They
call us foolish for believing unreasonable things, and they accuse of
falsehood, deceit, and imposture God who has given us faith, so they say, to
throw us into error. Let us prove to them, Christians, that it is not without
reason that we have believed, and we will then defend the cause of the author
of our faith. When we lived in the error in which the Gentiles are still today,
we have learned what they call their sacred dogmas by simple words which no
miraculous sign has confirmed; we looked upon it as useful in this doctrine,
not what the Divinity had revealed, but the tradition of an ancient custom, and
having been the plaything of a thousand vain illusions, we have recognized,
which is no mystery to anyone that it contains no hope of salvation. What
usefulness could be in fact a doctrine which was a pure invention of men? For
us, on the contrary, we have been led to believe in God and his Son incarnate
and crucified, not by speeches but by facts. We have seen resurrected dead,
purified lepers, the eyes of a blind-born open to light, demons driven out, and
all diseases healed. Now let us be told when we were mad, when we believed in
mere words, or when we only wanted to believe on facts? There is no doubt that
the facts preceded the words, since the latter were put into use only to
express the facts. If, then, without the testimony of any prodigy we have
believed in a human tradition which has been invented only to seduce the
spirits of men, how much more must we believe a doctrine of which miracles
which can only have God for author, demonstrate the divinity? Would we not
rightly pass for fools, if we refused to believe the testimonies of divine
power, after having believed in mere speeches? Would not our conduct be at once
improvident and inconsiderate, if we reject the call that hope makes us after
voluntarily following a doctrine without hope? They object to us that the
object of our faith is absurd. It is contrary to reason, they say, that God has
a Son, and that bodies that are victims of death and dissolution can come back
to life again. All the philosophers and the authors of various sects fought
each other by means of contradictory discussions, without any of them having
ever embraced another sect, because each one wanted to stay in the one that had
indoctrinated him. These contradictory discussions made victory impossible. No
one could prove that he was victorious; they got tired of this conflict of
opposing doctrines, but never succeeded in persuasion. That is why the
providence of God, whose designs are impenetrable, has resolved to join
miracles to preaching, so that the truth of preaching may be confirmed by the
irrefutable testimonies of divine power, and to silence the contradiction that
would have failed to attack the doctrine. What more convincing proof of the
truth than the operation of miracles? Now, if one insists against these
miracles by denying the reliability of the Scriptures, how can one accuse our
faith of madness, since we do not admit the testimony of the Scriptures? For in
the same books where it is written of Jesus Christ that we must believe that He
is the Son of God, we find these testimonies of the divine power. Will anyone
say that it is an absurdity that Jesus Christ the Son of God has been
crucified, that he will continue reading these sacred books, and he will find
that he is risen from the dead, and he will understand that it is neither
without reason nor against his will that Christ is dead, since he has been able
to resurrect, but that there is a mystery here. Whatever may be the
contradiction, then, he will cease to speak of the cross, because if he treats
it as madness, he cannot treat the resurrection in the same way, for the
resurrection serves as a defense to the cross; or if he tries to speak of the
cross, he will not be able to deny Divine providence manifested in it, and that
he sees confirmed by the testimony of the resurrection, for these two facts
must be accepted, or both of them rejected in such a way that the prosecution
is rendered impossible as the defense. But why did the Son of God allow himself
to be tied to a cross? It is a mystery whose explanation is reserved for
members of his family. He speaks of this death in such elevated terms, that he
declares that it is the principle of his glory. "I have the power,"
he says, "to give my life, and I have the power to take it back.” (Jn.
10:18) So he was not forced to die, because he had the power to die and to
resurrect. Anyone who disputes this power, cannot say that he has been the
victim of a violent death, because if he denies this power, he can no longer
assert that he is dead, since there is no mention of this power only in the
book where we read that he was delivered to death. No one can condemn the last
events by those who precede, nor the first by those who follow, for there can
be no contradiction in facts which belong to one and the same body of doctrine.
As for the resurrection of the dead, they do not speak sincerely, saying that
it is a folly to believe in it, for they have before them examples which make
it credible to them. Do not all the seeds necessary for the life of man begin
to dissolve and die before being reborn to life? If this is the order God has
established for things that are for the use of men, why treat fools who believe
that God follows the same course for their bodies? But they are themselves
foolish in refusing to God the power which they are obliged to recognize in the
world; for the time of these great acts of power has not yet come, and here we
see only the shadow. This is where God wanted the seed of faith to grow in
hearts. Yet we see that the only invocation of the cross strikes the demons of
terror, and if it is repeated it puts them to flight; and the gods of the
pagans, trembling and fearful in the name alone of the cross, dare no longer
render their oracles. If the death of Jesus Christ is a reproach, why does it imprint
terror? A death that is the punishment of a crime must be an object of contempt
rather than fear. Who dares to fear a man put to death for his crimes? Even if
he were innocent, we feel sorry for him, but we do not fear him. If, therefore,
the demons and gods of the Gentiles did not feel that the cross of Jesus Christ
contained a mystery, his name alone would not strike them with terror, and to
tell the whole truth they would not tremble in front of him if they were not
guilty; for all who stand with the demonic party have been accomplices in the
death of Jesus Christ. That is why the only name of the cross inspires fear and
terror to all the demons or false deities of the nations. For every man who has
taken part in the death of an innocent man cannot hear his name without his
heart being full of terror. Remembering his crime, he sees how guilty he is.
How much more are the demons or the gods of the nations, who are the
perpetrators of the death of the Lord and Savior of the world? But the Gentiles
claim to possess the truth as seniority; what has priority, they say, cannot be
false; as if seniority or a custom that dates back far enough to form a
privilege favorable to the truth. Then the homicides, the eminences, the
adulterers, all those who are guilty of other vices could as such defend their
crimes, because they have for them the antiquity and go back to the origin of
the world. It is, on the contrary, what should convince them of their error,
because we find an evil beginning to what is guilty and ashamed, whereas what
is honest and holy has always been honored as it deserved, and it is impossible
that vice preceded virtue. In the end, it cannot be denied that the religion of
the Gentiles is of human invention, while it is evident that ours has God as
author. The majesty of God was manifested on the mountain to give the law to
men; and to render it more worthy of faith, he preceded it by a multitude of
miracles and wonders wrought in Egypt, and which are still attested today by
the books which Ptolemy has preserved in the library of Alexandria. God deigned
to give his law with such an imposing device that no one could doubt that he
was the author. The majesty of God was publicly revealed to all eyes with so
much brilliancy and with circumstances so apt to inspire terror that it was
impossible not to believe that he was the only God and that men should observe
this that he commanded them. And to convince you that everything here is worthy
of divine wisdom, examine this law and see if it prescribes anything contrary
to justice, decency, or simply ridicule. This is how God had to make himself
known. He who cannot be constrained by any space should not appear in a place
ignored as an impostor, nor as in a mirror or by a deceptive mirage, where we
see something other than what exists, and the precepts he imposed were not to
be performed in darkness to cover what they had contrary to decency and virtue.
The knowledge of one God was erased in the world under the multiplicity of the
crimes of men; the lie had covered the truth with a veil; it was then that God,
in his clemency and mercy, unwilling to let his work perish, deigned to visit
mankind. He did not appear as those who took the title of gods, but he
manifested himself as the truth of God to destroy the error that had corrupted
the minds of men by the preaching of the plurality of the gods. The six hundred
thousand or more men who had come out of Egypt saw and recognized that it was
the God who is above all to the extraordinary brightness of his ineffable glory
(Exod. 20:18); They feared to approach him and worshiped him from afar in the
ground. New wonders, different from those he had wrought in Egypt, made known
to all by their divine character that he was the one and only God. The
knowledge of these wonders spread among all peoples, they were an object of
terror for the neighboring nations. What have the like made of the gods of the
nations? In what country, to what people have they manifested their glory? What
miracles, what prodigies have they performed as proofs of their divinity? In
what place, in what time did they make their voices heard? A foolish people has
begun to render divine honors to fantastic shades, to demons, to the images of
the dead, and this worship, having become habituated by a usage of several
centuries, claims to make a title for it to support that it is the truth. Now,
the truth does not come from the custom, which is itself the result of an old
custom, but of God, who makes himself recognized as God not by his antiquity,
but by his eternity. So faith is not a thing that begins, it is strictly
speaking without beginning. When we believe in God, we begin to believe; as to
the object of our faith, it is eternal. How then can the pagans boast of being
before us, since what is the object of their worship came only after God? Is
the work not after the craftsman? The pagans adore the works, we adore the
author of these works; they worship the creature, we worship the Creator. Did
God, who certainly created the world, not make himself known to men by this
creation? Shall we say that he has made man and that he does not want the
homage of him whom he has created? It's an absurdity. Hardly out of the hands
of God, man adored his Creator, because in this way he demanded reason and justice.
The worship of the true God having been weakened on the earth by the negligence
of men, God renewed it in the person of Abraham so that the knowledge of God
which had been given to Adam began again in Abraham, that his children were
raised in this knowledge, that it perpetuated without interruption and that
there were always on the earth men who adored the true God. The foreign peoples
themselves were called to this knowledge of God. Thus, the subject who knows
how to begin, the object that is known is above all beginning. On what grounds
do pagans thus rely to pretend that their religion is older than ours? If the
world is anterior to God (which we cannot admit), paganism is anterior to
Christianity. It is not the name of religion that adores a single God in the
mystery of the Trinity. That the name of Christ comes from <i>chrisma</i></font><font size="3"> (unction), we must always recognize that the reason of the
name is before the anointing. In our fathers, those who received the royal
anointing were called Christs and bore the image of Christ to come, who was
born of God the Father to be king and to bear the name of Christ rightly; for
birth gave him what anointing gives to the kings of the earth. As long as the
pagans do not know this truth, they reject it; but as soon as they know her,
they embrace her fervently, and rejoice at having passed from falsehood to
truth and evil. If they have, with all their enthusiasm, supported babbles and
nonsense, we see them deploy a force, a much greater passion, to sustain the
truth. What, then, is our Christ, whom we hate only when we do not know him,
and cannot help loving when we know him? For the wicked, on the contrary, we
love them when we do not know them, and we hate them as soon as we know them.
How many who, in the past, had hatred for Christ and who love him today, and
who regret having been able to hate what they did not know? One thing that one
does not know is always foolish, for one must first of all see if it deserves
the hatred one bears to it. Those who are fighting our religion today will be
tomorrow's defenders and will regret bitterly for knowing the truth too late.
If it were really worthy of hatred, or if it contained some deception, every
day Christians would return to paganism. But on the contrary, because it is the
truth, every day and at any time the Gentiles, and among them the wise and the
noble of this world, abandon the worship of Jupiter, whom they recognized as
god, to come running to Jesus Christ, to whom belongs honor and glory for ever
and ever. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— I remember having read earlier in a
booklet composed by Eusebius, a character of an otherwise remarkable doctrine,
that the Holy Spirit had not known the mystery of the birth of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, and I am sure that such a great man has dared to advance such an
unworthy opinion for the Holy Spirit; for it is thereby declaring that he is
inferior to God. It cannot be said, indeed, that it comes from God if he does
not know the things of God (Jn. 10:30), because an inferior nature does not
know the properties of a superior nature. If, on the contrary, he has the same
nature, the same divinity, how can he ignore things that are of his nature? The
Son of God after saying, "My Father and I are one," (Jn. 10:30) to
establish the unity of nature between his Father and him, adds with reason: "All
that belongs to my Father is mine, and all that belongs to me is to my Father."
(Jn. 16:15) If, then, the Holy Spirit has the same divinity, why refuse him the
same knowledge while granting him the same nature? You grant him the essential
prerogative, and you dispute that which is secondary. The creature learns, and
by its actions begins to know some truths about its author, and these truths
are common to him, but nature and divinity can never be common between God and
the creature. The divine nature has nothing to learn, because there is nothing
it does not know; human nature, on the contrary, does not have knowledge as an
essential property, it must learn. Knowledge, then, adds to, but does not
change, human nature, for man does not possess science by virtue of his nature,
he was created to acquire knowledge by his labor. Substance is therefore
superior to knowledge, for it is not knowledge that acquires substance, but
substance that acquires knowledge; we can, moreover, suppose the substance
without knowledge, but not knowledge without substance. In God, on the
contrary, knowledge is equal to substance, for the substance which has nothing
to learn is itself its knowledge. That's why everything in God is substantial.
The substance that nothing lacks possesses everything substantially, because
the learning cannot add anything to it. How then can one say of the Holy Spirit
that he does not know the birth of the Son of God if he is consubstantial with
him? Is knowledge and ignorance compatible in one and the same substance? It is
certain that the Son of God did not learn the mystery of his birth, he knows it
by virtue of his nature and not by learning; What reason is there for saying that
the Holy Spirit does not know, since he himself does not need to learn anything
because he knows everything by his nature? Like the Son of God, the Holy Spirit
is the substance of God, according to these words of the Savior: All that is to
my Father is mine, words which signify that His substance is the same as the
substance of God the Father. He also teaches us that the Holy Spirit proceeds
from the Father and receives from what is his. "For this reason," he
says, "he will receive from what is mine, because all that belongs to my
Father is mine.” If he proceeds from the Father and receives from the Son, how
can he ignore the birth of the Son, since his substance is the very substance
of the Son? For all that is to the Father is to the Son; therefore, without a
doubt, the substance of the Father is in the Holy Spirit. In fact, the Son
added: "And all that is mine is mine Father." Why then doubt that the
Holy Spirit has the same divinity, since he has the same nature? Our Lord does
not declare that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, as He proceeds from
Himself? And to prevent any other interpretation: and He proceeds from the
Father, he says, “and will receive from what is mine.” (Jn. 15:26, 16:14) That
is, for the Holy Spirit to proceed from the Father is to receive from what is
Christ Jesus. We say that he receives from what is the Son of God, and by the
same we affirm that he is of God, and that the Spirit certainly possesses the
substance and divinity of the Father. He who therefore claims that he does not
know the birth of the Son of God is an insult to him from whom the Holy Spirit
has received. For he receives nothing but the very nature of the one who
receives, since to receive from what is to Jesus Christ is to proceed from God;
he cannot therefore ignore what he knows from whom he has received what he is,
he cannot ignore the Lord, since he proceeds from God. The Son of God, by the
same thing that He comes from God the Father, knows all things of God; why then
deny that the Spirit knows all that pertains to Jesus Christ, since he has
received from him what he is? If therefore the Son of God knows what is in God,
no doubt that the Holy Spirit also knows what is in the Son of God, and if he
knows what is in the Son, why say that he does not know what is in the Son, who
is in God? He whom he receives gives him the knowledge of God. But why so many
reasonings? Does not the Apostle testify to this truth when he says,
"Nobody knows what is in God, except the Spirit of God?" (1 Cor.
2:11) This is the goal of our efforts attained with the aid of this testimony
of the Apostle. Now, this statement that no one knows what is in God except the
Spirit of God, does it harm the Son of God? Just as the Son in no way
prejudices the rights of the Holy Spirit when he says, "No one knows the
Father, except the Son." (Matt. 11:27) He declares that no one knows what
is in God, except that which is of God, for all that is of God knows God, and
that which is in God. The nature of God knows Himself, and as you are obliged
to recognize this nature in the Holy Spirit, by that alone that it proceeds
from the Father and that he has received from the Son, he would be reckless to
say that he does not know God the Father whose nature you recognize in him. And
yet the Savior declares that no one knows God the Father, except the Son, but
he reserves to another person the secret of this knowledge, immediately adding,
"And he to whom the Son willed to reveal it." Whom does the Son want
to reveal this truth? No one can be more intimate or dearer to him than his
Spirit, because, says the Apostle: "He who does not have the Spirit of
Jesus Christ is not his." (Rom 8:9) How then do you think that God the
Father was revealed to the Holy Spirit by the Son, if not in the way the Lord
Himself indicates to us by these words: "He will receive from me?” In
fact, God the Father cannot be revealed to a mere creature, for to be able to
bear the knowledge of the divine nature, we must have this same nature, since
God dwells in a light inaccessible to all creatures. (1 Tim. 6:16) But there
are some who maintain as reasonable the feeling of this who claim that the Holy
Spirit has not known the mystery of the birth of the Son of God, because it is
written of him that he scrutinizes all things (1 Cor. 2:10), and that to
scrutinize is a clue that one does not know. But this expression must be
understood by other similar places. Thus we see in Scripture that God says,
"I, God, I search the loins and the hearts," (Jer. 17:10) and in a
psalm: "God scrutinizes hearts and loins;" (Ps. 2:10) and the Apostle
himself says, "He who searches the hearts knows what are the desires of
the Spirit, because he asks for the saints what is according to God."
(Rom. 8:27) It can be seen from these examples that the Holy Spirit is not to
be seen as synonymous with ignorance, but also that he is scrutinizing the
depths of God, and what are those depths of God that he is probing. To
scrutinize the hidden things, means to enter here, so that it does not remain
unknown to him. The deep mysteries of God are the inner mysteries of the
divinity which cannot be scrutinized by the creature. We still read that the Holy
Spirit request according to the will of God for the saints what the saints do
not know at the testimony of the Apostle: "For we do not know what we must
ask of God in prayer." (Rom. 8:26) To know the deep secrets of God and to
know his will are therefore two synonymous things. Indeed, what mystery deeper
than the will of God, known mystery of the Holy Spirit and unknown to all others?
It is necessary to examine, in fact, what is the meaning of these words:
"Who among men knows what is in man, but the spirit of the man who is in
him?” The mind is here taken for the soul, because in fact no one knows what is
in the soul of man, except his soul which is his spirit. In the same way, no
one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God, that is to say God
himself, for he who is of God can only be understood as God himself. The Spirit
of God knows what is in God because he is of God. If, in fact, no one knows
God's thoughts, how much more can no one know the secrets and the will of God,
if he is not of God, that is to say, if he God himself, for God is known only
from Him alone. To speak even exactly there is no thought in God. God does not
discuss in himself what he must do or not do, deliberating whether it is useful
to act, for all that is in God exists in a certain way not by accident, but
substantially not as a result of learning, but by virtue of its nature, because
he is immutable. The Holy Spirit knows the mysteries of God only in virtue of
his nature, for the same nature must have the same thought, the same will. He
speaks of God who is always one and immutable, whether in the Son or in the
Holy Spirit. What the Father wants, the Son wants, too, and what the Son wants,
the Holy Spirit also wants. This is why he is sometimes called the Spirit of
God, sometimes the Spirit of Jesus Christ. He proceeds from God, says the
Savior, and he will receive from what is mine. That is why the Apostle St. John
says: "It is the Spirit He has given us that we know that God dwells in
us.” (1 Jn. 3:24) If then when the Spirit of God is in us, they say that God
abides in us; the Spirit of God is here God himself. Besides, it is the sign
for the faithful that they are the children of God, and it is after having
received the Holy Spirit that they dare proclaim themselves the children of
God. If they do not have this divine sign, they cannot be entitled to the name
of children of God. Let us say, however, that no one can be the true Son of God
in the sense that he would come wholly from God, considered in all the extent
of his nature, like Christ. It is through adoption that Christians become the
children of God. The Spirit of Jesus Christ that they receive gives them the
right to be called the children of God, because this Spirit they have in them
comes from God. In even adoptive children one must at least partly find the
nature of the father. In the world where things are flawed, those who are
adopted by men do not receive any proof of their adoption, except for the name
they bear. But God, perfection itself, does more; he shares with his adopted
sons his Spirit, which gives the adoption a true certainty, for the names
without things are meaningless. The Apostle comes to the support of our feeling
when he exclaims, "O depth of the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of
God, how incomprehensible are his judgments, and his ways impenetrable!"
(Rom. 11:33) But how is it that he says elsewhere that the depths of God is to
say the secrets can be probed, while he declares here that they are
impenetrable? The Apostle in this place wants to speak about the creature for
whom the secrets or the judgments of God are really impenetrable. But for the
Holy Spirit who knows all things of God, he declares that he can search all
that is in God, and affirms that the Spirit of God cannot ignore what remains
unknown to the creature. We cannot deny the nature of God; he necessarily knows
what is inaccessible to the creature. Those who give the Holy Spirit, the
Spirit of God, an inferior rank, shake the divine decree which makes the
salvation of all men dependent on the mystery of the divine Trinity, for if the
Holy Spirit is not consubstantial to God and to Christ, it is ridiculous to
place him in the same rank as the Father and the Son, and to say that without
him no one can claim either to salvation or to the God-givenness of a child of
God. If he does not have the same divinity, it is a folly to affirm it, or a
gratuitous concession made to it, which God forbid! What a little wise spirit
will dare to argue that the creature may be placed in the same rank as the
Creator, the Lord to be likened to him who has a beginning, the Lord equal to
the servant, the mighty confounded with him who has no power, the one who knows
everything with the one who lacks knowledge? It is time to put an end to this
slanderous accusation. The Holy Spirit is the third in order of enumeration and
not by nature; by the rank which we give him, and not by his divinity as the
third divine person, and not because he has not all knowledge. Just as the Son
comes second after the Father, without being inferior to him in divinity, so
the Holy Spirit comes after the Son, without being inferior to him; on the contrary,
he has with him the same nature, the same divinity. All that we read of the Son
of God, we also read from the Holy Spirit to the testimony of the Son of God
himself. It is he who says in effect: "I will pray to my Father, and he
will give you another Comforter, the Spirit of truth. (Jn. 1:16) Saying:
Another comforter, he teaches us that he himself is a comforter. St. John
teaches us the same truth when he says that the Son of God intercedes for our
sins. (1 Jn. 2:2) And the Apostle St. Paul says of the Holy Spirit: "The
Spirit of God asks for us." (Rom. 8:26) As you can see, Scripture presents
them both as our advocates near God. Our Lord still calls him the Spirit of
truth, and thereby shows that he is in all likeness to him who said, "I am
the truth." (Jn. 14:6) He declares that he was sent by his Father, and he
promises to send the Holy Spirit, and if he is not inferior to the Father who
sends him, the Holy Spirit is not inferior to the Son by whom he is sent. These
three distinct persons are not like each other's members each having different
attributions, they all have the same power, without any of them being anything
less than another. To finish this question, for we have already discussed it
more thoroughly in the booklet which we have composed against the impiety of
the Arians, in which we have embraced all that relates to the indivisible unity
of the Trinity.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

INTERESTED IN THE ACTIONS OF MEN. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
There are many that the darkness of this world have blinded and cannot suffer
to see us watch with scrupulous vigilance the commandments of God, flee the
opportunities of sin, apply us with a holy zeal to the practice of all good
works remain insensitive to seductive charms and the charms of vices, to be
superior to all the false pleasures of the world, willingly and courageously to
bear all the pains, all torments for the name of God, to despise death itself
by the power of the mind. They are those to whom all human thoughts have
persuaded that none of the actions of life are worthy of praise or blame. They
do not want God to be interested in any way. It is even who, in order to defend
their faults and their crimes, go so far as to say: It is useless to live well
or gravely, for God has no concern to consider attentively the various actions
you do under the inspiration of your particular desires, good or bad, and to
rest your eyes on some of your acts, sometimes very humiliating. All the
actions that men do according to their desires are vain. He who is united with
God remains isolated and separated from all human things; he is not irritated,
he is not moved by anything; he does not stop to consider any of the events,
any of the actions of the life of men; the rapid course of this world and the
inconceivable whirlwind of human changes prevail and carry it so far that one
must be regarded as a fool by claiming that one can be the object of the
particular providence of God. The martyrs themselves, who celebrate the mercy
of God and believe him to be pleasing by shedding their blood for him, are in
error. Nothing in us is agreeable or obnoxious to him; he is indifferent to the
miseries of our mortal condition as well as to that which can contribute to his
happiness; he does not wish to know any of the actions of men, not that it is
impossible for his divine majesty to have knowledge of all these past or
present actions, but because he wants to remain a stranger to the miseries of
men and to the vanities of this world. Is it not written: "Vanity of those
who indulge in vanity and all is vanity!” (Eccl. 1:21) This doctrine, which is
supported by despair, is fought against and destroyed not only by the authority
of the divine oracles, but by the religious language that we usually find on
the lips of men. When good and bad faith are in the middle of the business of
various profitable dealings, they invoke the testimony of the deity that they
claim to know nothing of what we do. I take God to witness, they say; may God
see us, may God judge us; May God intervene and take care of justice. And when
the oath is recognized as necessary, he who must lend it fears the consequences
of perjury, and the oath is required of him in the persuasion that a false oath
would not remain without punishment. Have they recovered their health, the
object of so many prayers and so many vows, they render to God thanksgiving!
Have they escaped an accident that seriously threatened their lives? It is to
the goodness of God, they say, that they are indebted to them. And when the unleashed
winds upset the sea, lift the waves and come to beat against the shaken sides
of the ship, all the passengers raise their hands to heaven, address to God the
most urgent supplications, and have the firm hope that he can answer them and
deliver them. Now, where does this persuasion come from, if God is completely
indifferent to what touches us, and if he completely ignores what we are doing?
This doctrine is therefore without foundation; God knows all things. Let no
one, therefore, blame himself that the crimes he has committed will go
unpunished. The reward of a holy life is great; his eternal torments are the
punishment of a guilty life. To us, therefore, who believe that God knows all
things, who runs to martyrdom with holy eagerness, God reserves an
inappreciable reward, an eternally happy life; but for the wicked who taught
that God knew neither their crimes nor their undisclosed and secret
depravities, they have to wait for a devouring fire, and a fire that will not
cease to consume them.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

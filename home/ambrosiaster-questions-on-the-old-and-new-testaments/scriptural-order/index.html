GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, BEGIN LIKE THIS: "THE BOOK OF THE GENERATION OF
JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF DAVID,” SINCE ABRAHAM IS BEFORE DAVID?</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> —</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> St. Matthew begins thus, because
he wanted to place at the head of the genealogy of the Savior the promise of
his incarnation, according to these words of the Apostle: "Whose fathers
are the patriarchs, and from whom came out according to the flesh Jesus
Christ." (Rom. 9) He says," The book of generation," because the
incarnation of Christ is the result of many different people from the same
stock; the ancestors of Christ followed various ways, and the Savior desired
that all should concur in forming the body of which he was clothed. There are
among them Jews and Gentiles, righteous men and sinners; Ruth was Moabite, and
Bersabee of adultery became a lawful wife. The Savior borrows the flesh of all
to bring them all back to unity. St. Matthew says, "Of Jesus Christ, the
son of David," though Abraham is before David, because Jesus Christ is
called especially David's son because of his kingship, that is to say, as God
comes from God, and that as king he descends from a king according to the
flesh, for it was said to David, "I will place on your throne a son that
will be born of you.” (Ps. 131)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

DIVIDE ALL GENERATIONS INTO THREE SETS?</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— This division is
based on the difference of things and times. So the first set goes from Abraham
to David, because it includes a first order of things, Abraham being the father
of faith as David is the father of kingship; for Saul he made himself unworthy of
the throne, which he lost through his fault. Another order of things begins
from David to transmigration, where the disapproved Jews of God were removed
from the royal authority. After the transmigration of Babylon to Jesus Christ,
opens a third period of calamities and miseries, captivity and dispersion of
the Jewish people; for although after the transmigration of Babylon and the
seventy years passed, the Jews were sent back to their homeland by Cyrus, they
never again had a fixed state of rest. Judea had no more kings, and the Jews
never ceased to live a restless and wandering life. At the very time of
Christ's coming, they recognize that they are in captivity. "We do not
have, they say, any other king than Caesar." (Jn. 19) This is the reason
why St. Matthew established three sets of generations, to show the various
states and changes deserved of the Jewish people from the promise to the advent
of Jesus Christ, but times did not fail to converge to the end to the same
grace.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

FOURTEEN ARE FORTY-TWO?</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">

one counts only forty-one generations; logically, we find forty-two. Jeconiah,
who was born in transmigration and to whom we give the title of king, as we
read in the book of Chronicles, finishes the second part; and as after the transmigration
king Nebuchadnezzar allowed him to remain in his kingdom, he also begins the
third series which continues until Jesus Christ. Jeconiah is counted twice,
that is to say that he finishes the second part and begins the third. Indeed,
the Evangelist continues: "And after the transmigration of Babylon,
Jeconiah begot Salathiel." Until this Salathiel, the kings of Judah of the
family from which Joseph was born were seated on the throne, and Jeconiah had a
first son named Assur, but since Joseph was born from Salathiel, the Evangelist
passes Assur in silence, and puts Salathiel immediately after Jeconiah his
father, to descend to Joseph, husband of the virgin Mary, after Josiah comes
Jeconiah. Though it is by Joachim, father of Jeconiah, that we reach Joseph,
the Evangelist passes over Joachim in silence, and immediately puts Jeconiah
not to exceed the number of fourteen generations, and after Jeconiah, Saluthiel
and his son, from which Joseph descends.</font><span><font size="3">

</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> There is no doubt that Jacob was
  Joseph's father. In fact, the genealogy starts from David, descends by
  Solomon and reaches in a straight line until Jacob, of which Joseph is the
  son. The genealogy of Heli, on the contrary, the son of Mathat, is true of
  David, but descends by Nathan, also son of David, until the time of the
  advent of the Savior. Now, the two evangelists, following the genealogy of
  each of the two brothers, made a split, that is to say that St. Matthew
  descends from David by Solomon to Joseph; while St. Luke ascends from Eli,
  contemporary with the Savior, by the line of Mathat, son of Nathan, son of
  David, and he unites the tribes of Eli and Joseph, to show that they are of
  the same family. By associating Heli with Joseph, he shows that their
  genealogy is no different, but that they are brothers, and that consequently
  the Savior is not only Joseph's son, but also Eli's son. For the same reason,
  in fact, that the Savior is called the son of Joseph, he is also the son of
  Heli and all the others who are of the same tribe, a truth which the Apostle
  expresses in these terms: fathers the patriarchs, and from whom came out
  according to the flesh, Jesus Christ. (Rom. 9:5) It is by a divine
  inspiration that St. Luke ascends from Heli by the line of Nathan to David,
  and by Tharam his father, to Sem, son of Noah, and before the flood, to Seth,
  son of Adam, given to him to replace Abel, and he presents the Savior as sons
  of Adam for the same reason that he calls him sons of Joseph and Eli. He
  raises him even above Adam, and before the existence of all flesh, he
  declares that Christ is the son of God. There are some who think that Heli
  had married Jacob's wife, following the law's prescription that if a man died
  childless, his brother or one of his relatives would marry his wife and give
  children to his brother. (Deut. 25:5) It is then understood, say they, that
  Joseph was begotten for his brother Jacob, whose wife he had married. The two
  genealogies are thus united, and it is not extraordinary that the evangelist
  gives Heli as his father to Joseph. This explanation has no probability and
  does not solve the difficulty. On the contrary, the sentiment which we have
  expounded above unites the two brothers of one father, and shows that Christ
  was the Son of God before any generation. How, indeed, does St. Luke express
  himself? "And Jesus, beginning his mission, was about thirty years old,
  as it was believed of Joseph, who was of Heli," that is, that it was
  believed that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was not only Joseph's son, but
  also Eli's son. (Luke 3:23) He does not say that Joseph was son of Eli, but
  just as Jesus was called Joseph's son, he was also sons of Eli, because
  Joseph and Heli were sons of two brothers, that is, of Solomon and Nathan,
  sons of David, and thus going up by David unto Abraham, and Noah, and Seth,
  even unto Adam himself, and over Adam, he taught that the Christ was the Son
  of God. Indeed, saying: "Who was son of Seth, who was the son of Adam,
  who was the son of God, he shows that Christ was the son of Adam in the same
  way that he was called the son of Joseph, that Mary said, “and my son, why
  did ye do this, and behold, we, your father and I, were greatly
  afflicted." (Luke 2:48) But he rises above Adam for to unite Christ to
  God the Father, in order to make it clear that if he were called the son of
  all who descend from Adam to Joseph and Heli, he had before all these
  generations the true Son of God, and thus to confuse the error of Photius,
  who maintained that Christ came only from Mary and had not existed before
  him, so that he was given for fathers those of whom he was not the son, and
  denied that he was the God's true son, when he really was, if we adopt the
  explanation as improbable as useless as we have reported above, and according
  to he is called the son of Heli, the story of the evangelist simply means
  that Christ was the son of Adam, but not that he was the son of God. In going
  up, indeed, from the sons to the fathers, he arrives at Enoch, whose father
  is Seth, the father of Seth is Adam, and Adam has for father God; but I do
  not see that he was otherwise useful to express oneself in this way. If, on
  the contrary, each of those who form the continuation of the genealogy are
  called the fathers of Jesus Christ, in the same sense that he was called the
  son of Joseph, following these words: "Whose fathers are the patriarchs,
  and of whom went out according to the flesh Jesus Christ;" (Rom. 9:5)
  Following this order, we understand that the Evangelist says that he was son
  of Seth and son of Adam. And going back above all the patriarchs, he declares
  that he was the Son of God to show that he existed long before those of whom
  he is called the Son.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE TRANSMIGRATION OF BABYLON, THERE ARE SEVENTEEN GENERATIONS; WHY, THEN, DOES
THE EVANGELIST COUNT FOURTEEN, PUTTING OCHOSIAS WHO AFTER JEHORAM IS THE SON OF
JEHOSHAPHAT, AS WELL AS JOASH OF OCHOSIAS AND AMASIAS SON OF JOASH? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— It must be admitted that the
evangelist has conformed here to the spirit of the law. It is therefore rightly
that these kings have been cut off from the series of generations; for their
impiety has been perpetuated without the slightest interruption. After
beginning in Joram, he continued on to Osias, son of Amasias, and none of these
princes could find in the virtues of their father a support which enabled them
to appear in the series of kings of Judah. Jehoram gave himself up to all kinds
of crimes, but Jehoshaphat had to be kept among the kings. Uzziah owed the same
favor to Joatham's wife. The life of these three princes was only continual
impiety against God. It was thanks to his father's merit that Solomon remained
on the throne, and his son Rehoboam had to be preserved in spite of his
criminal life among the kings of Judah. As for these three impious kings, they
have been shut up in the midst of their crimes and cut off from genealogy; for
the example of vice entails the ruin of a whole race when it is given with
brilliancy and without discontinuity. To be more precise, these kings have been
omitted, because Joseph does not descend from their race. The Evangelist,
indeed, has followed from Abraham the genealogy of those of whom Joseph descends,
to whom Mary was born, from whom was born the Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">This question can be
heard from a double point of view. First, the house of Jesus Christ is the
Church, which was built by his blood. His body may also be called his house,
just as it is called his temple. If it is called its temple because it is
inhabited, it can also very well be called its home, as we read in the law. But
if the body was formed by the operation of the Holy Spirit and we thought we
could give it the name of house, we will ask why we attribute this formation to
the person of Jesus Christ. The Son's operation is the Father's operation,
because they have one and the same virtue. In the same way the operation of the
Holy Spirit is the operation of the Son of God, because of the unity of nature and
will. Whether the action comes from the Father, or from the Son, or from the
Holy Spirit, it is the Trinity who acts, and all that is done by the three
divine persons is the work of one God. The Son's operation is the Father's
operation, because the Father and the Son have one and the same virtue. In the
same way, the operation of the Holy Spirit is the operation of Christ, because
the Holy Spirit has received from what was his. If we consider the action of
persons, it is by the operation of the Holy Spirit that Christ was made flesh,
that is, made man; but if we consider the action of the divine nature, it is
Christ who has worked in the virgin to become flesh; for the Holy Spirit and
Jesus Christ have one and the same divinity, and therefore the work of the Holy
Spirit is the work of Jesus Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  COULD THE MAGI OF CHALDEA LEARN THE BIRTH OF CHRIST, KING OF THE JEWS, ON THE
  APPEARANCE OF A STAR THAT IS MORE COMMONLY THE SIGN THAT ANNOUNCES A KING OF
  THE EARTH?</font></span></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—
  These Magi of Chaldea studied the course of the stars not for any evil, but
  out of curiosity. As the Evangelist's account suggests, they followed the
  Balaam tradition that Balak had brought to curse the people of God and that a
  divine impulse forced him to bless him. (Num. 21:20) They knew by this
  historical fact that the providence of God was to bring out a king of Jacob;
  Balaam had indeed clearly predicted that a star would rise from Jacob. The
  Magi, faithful to this tradition, seeing a star shine in the sky outside the
  ordinary course of the stars, understood that it was the one that Balaam had
  foretold as the future sign of the birth of the king of the Jews. This fact
  goes directly against the enemies of religion. Here religion receives a
  testimony from those who are in the habit of attacking it, for astrologers
  are enemies of the truth.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">It is not
  for an evil reason that the Magi of Chaldea, etc. “A star will come out of
  Jacob, an offshoot will rise from Israel; he will smite the heads of Moab and
  ruin all the children of Seth; he will possess Edom, etc.” (Num. 24:17) This
  prophecy comes from Balaam; he was not a prophet, but God chose him to defend
  the cause of his people and forced him in spite of himself to serve his
  purposes. Thus we see those whom Saul had sent to seize David, seized with
  the prophetic spirit, and it is said of Saul himself: "Is Saul also
  among the prophets?” God wished to show by how great was the majesty of the
  God of the Jews, who so changed the heart of him who had come to curse, that
  this false prophet regarded it as a good and commendable action to bless the
  people of God. God could not fear the curse of him whose heart was in his
  power. Now, one is allowed to believe that the tradition of this prophet had
  been preserved by those who applied to the same studies; by carefully
  examining the stars, they saw an unknown star shining so brightly that it
  shone out the sunlight (for it was visible during the day), and having

  COULD THE MAGI OF CHALDEA LEARN THE BIRTH OF CHRIST, KING OF THE JEWS, ON THE
  APPEARANCE OF A STAR THAT IS MORE COMMONLY THE SIGN THAT ANNOUNCES A KING OF
  THE EARTH?</font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> —
  These Magi of Chaldea studied the course of the stars not for any evil, but
  out of curiosity. As the Evangelist's account suggests, they followed the
  Balaam tradition that Balak had brought to curse the people of God and that a
  divine impulse forced him to bless him. (Num. 21:20) They knew by this
  historical fact that the providence of God was to bring out a king of Jacob;
  Balaam had indeed clearly predicted that a star would rise from Jacob. The
  Magi, faithful to this tradition, seeing a star shine in the sky outside the
  ordinary course of the stars, understood that it was the one that Balaam had
  foretold as the future sign of the birth of the king of the Jews. This fact
  goes directly against the enemies of religion. Here religion receives a
  testimony from those who are in the habit of attacking it, for astrologers
  are enemies of the truth.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">It is not
  for an evil reason that the Magi of Chaldea, etc. “A star will come out of
  Jacob, an offshoot will rise from Israel; he will smite the heads of Moab and
  ruin all the children of Seth; he will possess Edom, etc.” (Num. 24:17) This
  prophecy comes from Balaam; he was not a prophet, but God chose him to defend
  the cause of his people and forced him in spite of himself to serve his
  purposes. Thus we see those whom Saul had sent to seize David, seized with the
  prophetic spirit, and it is said of Saul himself: "Is Saul also among
  the prophets?” God wished to show by how great was the majesty of the God of
  the Jews, who so changed the heart of him who had come to curse, that this
  false prophet regarded it as a good and commendable action to bless the
  people of God. God could not fear the curse of him whose heart was in his
  power. Now, one is allowed to believe that the tradition of this prophet had
  been preserved by those who applied to the same studies; by carefully
  examining the stars, they saw an unknown star shining so brightly that it
  shone out the sunlight (for it was visible during the day), and having
  conferred between them, they discovered that was the star predicted by
  Balaam.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

of these four parts was given to Pilate, who administered him not as king, but
as governor, while the sons of Herod retained the title of king. Philippe being
dead also, his brother Herod married the wife of Philip, a crime which John the

we spoke earlier to put to death the holy precursor. What does the Evangelist
say? "Herod the Tetrarch," that is to say, who governed the fourth
part of the kingdom of his father Herod. What doubt is still possible with this
addition of Tetrarch, which clearly proves that it is another Herod than the

  DOES IT SAY THAT RACHEL IS MOURNING HER CHILDREN WHEN IT WAS LIA'S CHILDREN
  WHO HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
  According to history, in fact, Rachel's children are of the tribe of
  Benjamin, in punishment of their personal crimes, that is to say, Sodom's
  crimes and the abominable crime they committed on the wife of a Levite, they
  were completely destroyed and destroyed by the other tribes. (Jud. 19)
  Rachel, therefore, does not wish to receive any consolation, because she
  knows that there is no hope for those who have perished in this way. The sons
  of Lia, on the other hand, were put to death in their early years for the
  cause of the Savior. Also Lia does not want to be mourned, because these
  innocent victims have been sacrificed for God and have certainly received
  from him for reward the eternal life. For Rachel's sons, they are worthy of
  tears, because they are forever dead for time and for eternity. The children
  of Lia shed tears, it is true, but they received spiritual consolations. But
  the children of Rachel, whose life was carnal, will be consumed in the
  immaterial flames of hell. But the Evangelist testifies that Rachel mourned
  the deaths of the children of Lia because she was dying on the fate of her
  own children seeing the children of her sister massacred for a cause so
  glorious that their death assured them the inheritance of eternal life. In
  fact, for the one who is in misfortune, the happiness of others causes them
  to bitterly deplore their own misfortunes.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

49.</font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> WHY WAS THE SAVIOR, WHO WAS A
SAINT FROM HIS BIRTH AND WHO RECEIVED THE NAME OF CHRIST THE LORD, BAPTIZED,
SINCE BAPTISM WAS INSTITUTED TO PURIFY SIN? </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> It is a truth of course that the
Savior did not need to be baptized, because he was not made, but was born
Christ, as the angel told the shepherds: "Behold, today is to you a
Savior, who is the Christ, the Lord.” (Luke 2:11) Also John the Baptist, who
knew his holiness, refused to give him baptism; but the Savior insisted on
receiving him, not to blot out his sins, but to accomplish all justice. It was
fitting, in that person, that he who came to teach men that by baptism they
would become children of God, set an example for the future children of God. It
was fitting that he who promised that God would give the Holy Spirit to all who
would believe, saw the Divine Spirit descending visibly upon him, to give the
faithful the sure hope that they would receive the same Spirit, though from an
invisible way. Indeed, the Savior who was born of the Holy Spirit, had a pure
body of all sin. The divine anointing had been communicated spiritually to his
flesh in the womb of the Virgin. The Holy Spirit purified what was taken from
the Virgin Mary to form the body of the Savior, and it was the anointing that
was given to his body. This is why he received from his birth the name of
Christ. What God gave through the ministry of the prophets and the anointing of
holy oil to those who received royal consecration, the Holy Spirit gives to
Jesus Christ by adding the power to atone for sins. Those who had previously
betrayed the name of Christ received exclusively by this anointing the power of
command; the Savior received this power in his birth, at the same time that he
was born in a state of perfect holiness. What sovereign impropriety, in fact,
that the Son of God was born in a body enslaved by sin? Since he came to take
charge of the interests of men and teach them to become the children of God
through the sacrament of regeneration, he himself had to receive baptism to
confirm his doctrine by his example; for a master easily persuades the truth of
his teachings when he puts them first into practice. The miracles that
accompanied the baptism of the Lord had the effect of manifesting Him as the
Son of God, who by the ministry of regeneration came to heal the passions of
the body, and to show by His example to those who were to be His brethren, that
the sacrament regeneration communicates to him who receives it a divine power.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  belonging to ancient times. It had to keep its authority until Jesus Christ,
  and remain in force until the birth of Christ promised to Abraham; Once the
  promise was fulfilled, circumcision was no longer necessary. It was like
  Christ's image that Isaac was promised to Abraham. God indeed says to him,
  "All nations shall be blessed in him that comes out of you," (Gen.
  22:18), that is, in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ came to renew the faith that
  Abraham had received, so that all nations would be blessed in him who came
  out of Abraham, that is, in Jesus Christ, according to the promise made to
  Abraham. Circumcision was therefore the sign of the Son of God promised to
  Abraham, that is, Christ. This sign of the promise must have ceased at the
  birth of Christ; but he who was the object of the promise must have received
  at birth the sign of his father, to be recognized as the one who, according
  to the promise, was to justify all the nations by faith joined to the
  circumcision of the heart. The circumcision of the body was the outward sign
  that distinguished the children of Abraham according to the flesh; the
  circumcision of the heart is the invisible sign that distinguishes its
  spiritual children, and that is why carnal circumcision had to cease after
  the coming of Jesus Christ.<span>  </span></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"My son, coming near to the service of God, abide in righteousness and
fear, and prepare your soul for temptation." (Eccles. 2:1) The Savior wanted
to fast in order to give us the example of applying ourselves to the practice
of fasting, if we wish to triumph by the help of God from the attacks of the
devil, and to teach ourselves by his example, that we must above all fear his
pitfalls, when we embrace the service of God. Unhappy to see that we are moving
away from him, the devil redoubles with fury against us. It is therefore in our
interest and not for him that the Savior acts here. Likewise, if he agrees to
feel the need of hunger, it is not for him, it is for us. Indeed, when he had
triumphed by the fast of the temptations of the devil that are not all written,
because they did not relate directly to our instruction, after forty days of
fasting, he agreed to feel the need of hunger. What was in the nature of man,
so that the devil he had conquered, perceiving in him this infirmity of hunger,
was excited to tempt him again in the persuasion that he had been vanquished by
a man. Such was indeed the mysterious conduct of the Savior, the devil insulted
and made his tyrannical empire felt to the man he had conquered, God allowed
that he in turn be vanquished by the man who owed to the divine power this
victory, and Satan is thus deeply humbled, because he sees only one man and
does not understand the power that is in man. He remains astonished and
stupefied by this mystery, the knowledge of which escapes him; he has the power
of approaching; he has not the power to conquer that which attacks him. Two
things were tormenting here, he approached him emboldened by the weakness he
saw and he met a virtue he did not suspect, so that in this man he had before
him, he suspected the power of God. Our Lord therefore submits to the necessity
of hunger to thwart the wiles of Satan. He no longer prolonged his fast, so to
establish the agreement between him, Moses and Elijah.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

BAPTIST, WHO HAD FIRST BORNE WITNESS TO THE SAVIOR, THEN CONCEIVED OF DOUBTS BY
ASKING HIM BY HIS DISCIPLES: ARE YOU THE ONE TO COME, OR SHOULD WE EXPECT
ANOTHER? </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Those
who think that doubt may have entered the soul of John the Baptist slander the
Savior. For they claim that John has reason to doubt, or they accuse Jesus
Christ of ignorance, since in their feelings he would have praised a man who
thought badly of him. But since it is impossible for the Savior to be mistaken,
the praise he gives to John the Baptist is therefore well founded. If they are
founded, John has no doubt about Jesus Christ. In fact, in the very time that
John of his prison sends his disciples to Jesus to ask him, "Do you read
whoever is coming, or should we expect another?" Jesus answers the
disciples of his forerunner: "Go and tell John what you have heard and
seen: The blind see, the deaf hear, the lepers are healed, the lame walk, the
dead rise, and happy is he who is not offended because of me.” Now, as John's
messengers were leaving, Jesus began to say of John the Baptist to the
multitude: What did you go to see in the desert? A reed waved by the wind, or a
man dressed softly? Those who are dressed softly live in the palace of kings.
What did you go to see? A prophet! Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet:
for it is from him that it was written: Here it is that I send my angel before
you, to prepare the way where you must walk. Then the publicans who were
baptized with John's baptism, glorified the righteousness of God. What greater
praise can the Savior make of John than to say that he is more than a prophet?
The Savior goes on proclaiming blessed who has not been scandalized because of
him; how could he have praised John who would have been scandalized by doubting
the person of the Savior? But no, John Baptist did not doubt for a moment. The
praises Jesus gives him prove that he is truly happy because he was not
scandalized because of him. Why, indeed, does the Savior choose this very
moment to make such a glorious eulogy of John the precursor? It is to show that
the spirit of John was not worked by doubt. John, knowing that his death was
near, and wishing to fortify his disciples in the Savior's faith, wanted him to
confirm with his own mouth what he had taught them of his divine person. It is
therefore to confirm the truth of his testimony that he has recourse to a more
excellent authority, so that before this agreement of two witnesses, no doubt
is possible. John the Baptist therefore thinks he ought to employ this means of
sending his disciples who seem to doubt his words, so that when he hears the
same teachings from the mouth of the Savior, their faith is confirmed by this
persuasion. that the testimony of the Lord descended from heaven and that of
his worthy representative could not be doubted. The Savior seems to be
responding to John himself, so that his disciples could learn the truth by
bringing John's question closer to the Savior's answer.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

John the Baptist was raised from his cradle to such eminent sanctity that one
cannot admit either that he could have been deceived or misled others, nor that
he did not know his Lord, who in the bosom of his mother had filled him with
the brightest lights by the Holy Spirit. It is certain that he knew him when
the Holy Spirit descended on him and he was not without knowing him before he
came to him to be baptized. Yes, he knew him, but he did not know if he was the
one who was to bring to the earth the gift that God had previously promised to
the patriarchs. This is what he says he knew when he saw the Holy Spirit coming
down on him. This is, indeed, the sign that God had given him: "He on whom
you will see the Holy Spirit come down and rest, it is he who baptizes in the
Holy Spirit." (Jn. 1:33) The apostle testifies to the same truth when he
says, "I say that Jesus Christ was the minister of the gospel to the
circumcised Jews, to verify the word of God, and to confirm the promises made
to our fathers." (Rom. 15:8) This is what John the Baptist did not know in
the Lord; for although his greatness was not unknown to him, he did not know,
however, that it was through him that the promises made to Abraham were to be fulfilled.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  THE LAW HAS CEASED TO BE OBLIGATORY TO THE PREACHING OF JOHN THE BAPTIST OR
  THE SAVIOR, HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THESE WORDS OF OUR LORD: "I DID NOT COME
  TO DESTROY THE LAW OR THE </font><a name="_Hlk519956712"><font color="#000000" size="3">PROPHETS, BUT TO FULFILL
  IT?" IF IT WERE FORBIDDEN TO OBSERVE IT, WAS IT NOT DESTROYED BY LOSING
  THE AUTHORITY IT HAD OVER THE CONDUCT OF MEN? </font></a></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— All that was predicted of Jesus
  Christ was accomplished, and our Lord Himself fulfilled the law and the
  prophets when He did all that the Scriptures had said of Him; he destroyed
  nothing, but confirmed all things. It was he who had been the object of the prophetic
  oracles, and the predictions concerning him no longer have to wait for
  fulfillment after him; just as after him the prophets could not make similar
  predictions, because they had no object and the one they had predicted had
  come. They have embraced everything in their writings, they have foretold his
  incarnation, his life, his passion, his resurrection, the manifestation of
  his divinity, the judgment to come, and therefore their prophetic ministry
  had to cease when the work they predicted was fulfilled. Now, the law has
  ceased in two ways, but not entirely, because what has ceased can still
  remain if one remains in the condition of the law. We must distinguish here
  in what has ceased the sentence of the law, of the law itself. When John the
  Baptist preached the baptism of penance for the remission of sins, the
  sentence of the law that declared sinners guilty ceased, so were the burdens
  of the law that were imposed upon the Jews because of the hardness of their
  hearts, like the precepts which had for their object food, new moon, sabbath,
  or other similar things. The reign of justice was to give place to the reign
  of mercy. The fear of suffering himself from what he was forbidden to do to
  others kept him away from any act of aggression. But the Savior elevates this
  commandment to a much higher degree of righteousness: "For my sake I say
  to you not to resist evil, but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, show
  him the left," (Matt. 5:39; Luke 6:29) and thus offers the means of
  being perfect to one who does not render evil for evil. To render evil for
  evil is an act of justice, but which is far from being full and complete; to
  conceal the injury we have received, that is the full and perfect justice.
  The vengeance that comes from evil can give satisfaction for a moment, but
  one gets an eternal joy by returning this vengeance to the future judgment.
  The Savior has thus fulfilled the law by making more just those to whom the
  law teaches justice, without being able to do more. It is therefore a real
  joy for the law to see its disciples more educated. The Savior had destroyed
  the law if he had taught men to sin with impunity. Now, it differs from
  rendering the sentence to leave to the one who has misused the time of
  repentance; if he does not profit by it, this sentence falls all the more

  THE LAW HAD TO STOP AT THE PREACHING OF THE SAVIOR OR OF JOHN THE BAPTIST,
  HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THESE WORDS OF THE SAVIOR: I DID NOT COME TO DESTROY THE
  LAW OR THE PROPHETS, BUT TO FULFILL THEM? IF THE LAW CEASED TO EXIST, HOW WAS
  IT NOT DESTROYED, SINCE IT LOST ITS STRENGTH AND AUTHORITY? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The oracles of the prophets who
  announced the coming of the Messiah, received their fulfillment at his
  coming. When the object of a prediction comes true, it is accomplished. The
  law which, as we have said, was given for a time, ceases with the time that
  it was forbidden for it to go beyond, because it then received its
  fulfillment. The law would have lost its authority, it would have seemed
  destroyed, if it had not ceased at the appointed time. A successor is given
  to a man of dignity, will it be said that he is destroyed? The law would have
  been truly destroyed if it had been denounced, accused when it was in all its
  force. And notice that the Savior does not say that He filled, but fulfilled
  the law and the prophets. Now, the word accomplish means to add to make
  complete. What is adding to the prophets? It is to establish the worship of
  God under the name of the Trinity. No doubt the prophets taught and took back
  the people in the name of God, but this mystery remained hidden. To fulfill
  the law is to add new precepts to the ancients, for example: "You have
  learned that the ancients have been told: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
  tooth. And I say to you not to resist abuse, but if anyone struck you on the
  right cheek, show him the left again." (Matt. 5:38-39) This is how the
  Savior fulfill the law. He does not destroy it, he adds to it more perfect
  precepts, not to condemn as guilty the one who avenges himself, but to show
  that it is more perfect not to avenge himself. He wanted only what is
  contained in the law well understood, but he perfected the intention of the
  law. To teach justice to man, and to save him by the same, the law condemned
  him who had snatched an eye to lose an eye himself; The law wanted to inspire
  men with fear, to turn them away from doing what they would not have done to
  them, and to find their salvation in observing this precept. But since the
  human race is fragile and prone to sin, it exposes itself to suffer what it
  does not want to be done to it. The Savior therefore changed the terms of the
  law and taught what is truly helpful to salvation to fulfill the true meaning
  of the law. The fear of law being powerless to save men, they would be thus
  overcome by patience and brought to correct themselves. This precept was
  given so that men of mild morals could find life in the exercise of patience,
  by not rendering harm to those who do them, by not rendering evil to those
  who make them of it, and that if they wish to correct themselves, the good
  ones could benefit from it, and the wicked a double punishment. Therefore,
  justice has not been destroyed, since we see it exercised by the Apostles,
  and Peter has used it against Ananias and Sapphire. (Acts 5:1) The chosen
  vessel, far from rejecting it, made use of it itself by blinding the magician
  Elymas who resisted the voice of the Lord. (Acts 13:11) There is yet another
  point where the law has been fulfilled. Our Lord says, "You have heard
  that it has been said, You will love your neighbor, and you will hate your
  enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies.” (Matt. 5:43) He adds to the law,
  that is, he does it, because he does not destroy the old commandments, but he
  adds to it more excellent precepts to lead men to perfection. The enemies,
  that is, the wicked, could not have been corrected and made better by the
  punishment permitted by justice. Our Lord wants to save them by love and
  benevolence, which is what the law contained in its womb. His intention was
  to remove all enmity, and men, terrified of the punishment which threatened
  them, ceasing to be at war with one another. But men have gone so far as to
  despise the fear of the law and of nature; they have become day by day worse;
  it was then that the Savior wanted to triumph over these enmities by
  humility, so that men would be brought back to good by seeing that they were
  not made enmity for enmity, and that those who persevered in feelings of
  hatred punished more severely, since they could not be vanquished by the
  humility of the one they should have felt just revenge. The justice that
  exerts vengeance has not been destroyed, it is only suspended in both cases.
  It has ceased for the one who knows himself; it rigorously punishes the one
  who is rebellious to his prescriptions.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is no doubt that the devil is the enemy of man and especially of the faithful
Christian. It is against the servants of God that he sharpens his most
formidable features. In the same way that the demon is the enemy of the good,
so the law is opposed to the wicked, for who is not opposed to the one who
despises it? The Lord thus warns the sinner to agree with the commandments
which condemn his disobedience, to submit to their will, and to become a friend
instead of an enemy, as he was. Indeed, the contempter of the law is his enemy
because he resists his will. The Lord therefore exhorts the sinner to be
reconciled to the law by his good works, lest it accuse him before the judge on
the day of judgment, and then be condemned to the just punishments of his
contempt for the law. For, says the Savior, the doctrine of the Lord is an
enemy of every man who desires to do evil; if he does not agree with it, he
will be thrown into hell that has been prepared for the devil, the true enemy
of the human race. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  LORD COMMANDS US TO PRAY FOR OUR ENEMIES, HOW THEN TO EXPLAIN THIS PLACE OF
  REVELATION, WHERE THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED ASK GOD TO AVENGE
  THEM? (REV. 6:10) </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
  The souls of those who were put to death demanded revenge as the blood of
  Abel cried out for vengeance from the earth (Gen. 4:10); it is the facts
  themselves that cry out for vengeance even though they are deprived of
  language. What, indeed, does the blood ask for, except that it is avenged,
  and it cries out for vengeance not by speaking, but by the very fact of its
  bestowal? It is thus said that a work praises the one who made it by that
  alone that it rejoices his eyes. The saints are not so impatient that they
  urge God to do what they know must be done at the appointed time and whose
  fulfillment cannot be anticipated or deferred. Saint John wanted to teach us
  by these words that God would one day avenge the blood of his saints, lest
  the patience he uses make him believe in the impunity of this impious war
  that is made to the saints, and at the same time to inspire the persecutors
  of the servants of God with dread and to encourage those who suffer for his
  name. The soul of the sufferer regains courage when she learns that they will
  be avenged by a powerful hand. They are full of hope at the thought that
  their death has not the approval of their judge, for they are certain then of
  their innocence. God is merciful and patient, but he acts with great
  moderation. He expects the ungodly to open their hearts to faith and sinners
  to convert; if they do not profit by this grace, they will be punished for
  having despised the long patience of God. Now, he gives us examples of this
  truth even in the time when his mercy is announced so that his patience is
  not treated with insensibility which cannot be touched, neither by the
  sufferings, nor by the feelings of the piety. This is why he says through his
  prophet, "I am silent, but will I keep quiet?" (Isa. 42:14) and Our
  Lord Himself: "Will not God do justice to his elect who cry to him day
  and night?” They shout in the manner we have said above. If, then, a Christian
  avenges himself here below without excessive rigor, and without shedding
  blood, he does not sin; it will be better, however, to abandon this vengeance
  to God, who is his judge. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  LORD HAS TAUGHT US TO PRAY FOR OUR ENEMIES, SO WHY DO THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO

  6:10)</span></span></span><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The author of the Apocalypse,
  predicting the future calamities and tribulations by which the righteousness
  of God should punish the ungodliness and crimes of men, and by showing from
  the look of enlightened faith the punishment of every sin says that the souls
  of those who have been slain cry vengeance night and day to prove that no act
  of impiety or cruelty will go unpunished. Now, there is nothing in this that
  is contrary to the precept of the Lord. Indeed, God is the author of this
  law, after having exercised his vengeance on the day of judgment. This
  precept is therefore for the present life, and the souls of those who have been
  put to death are excusable, since they ask for vengeance while they are in
  possession of the other life. However, to give a truer explanation, it is the
  very fact of their shed blood that cries out here revenge. This fact is not
  silent, it does not stop asking for revenge. As God said to Cain, "The
  blood of your brother is crying out to me from the earth.” (Gen. 4:10) What
  is the meaning of these words? It is that the very act of the crime demands
  justice and cries for vengeance; just as we say that the earth praises the
  Lord, because it is his work, although it has neither voice nor feeling. One
  cannot suppose in the saints either so much patience or so much ignorance
  that they ask God to avenge them before the day of judgment and that they
  urge him to do what they know they should not do to accomplish that at the
  time marked. This is what the Savior says in express terms: "Will not
  God do justice to his elect who cry to him night and day?"</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— Under one name, the law contains three
different meanings. The first part of the law has God as its object. The name
of law, <i>lex</i></font><font size="3">, comes from </font><i><font size="3">lectio</font></i><font size="3">, choice, because it teaches you
what you must choose between several things. Men in error have therefore
received the law to help them choose the truth, that is, to make them choose
God by renouncing the devil. The second part of the law is the one that includes
the precepts, the first of which begins: "Honor your father and your
mother." The third part deals with new moons, Sabbath-keeping,
discernment, and the choice of food, circumcision and the sacrifices of animals.
It is from this last part of the law that Our Lord says that it lasted only to
John, and that henceforth it must not be observed any more. Because it was
given to stop when its time would be accomplished; for it was not promulgated
from the beginning, but for particular reasons, and for a fixed time, which was
not to extend beyond the advent of the Savior. What remains then of the law is
that which has God as its object, the precepts, and that which relates to the
nature of God, which the Son of God, without doubt, cannot destroy. It is through
him, in fact, that we tend towards the rewards we are promised; because fear
produces attentive vigilance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

100. </font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">ON THE GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW.</font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> — You have heard, my dear
brothers, what our Lord says in his Gospel: "I give you glory, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise
and the prudent, and you revealed them to the little ones. Yes, my Father,
because it pleased you so. "(Matt. 11:25-26) If we are to weigh the meaning
of these words of Our Lord, we will see that they are meant to encourage the
faithful, those who, because they despise the wisdom of the world, appear small
in the eyes of the sages of the world, who, without any merit, claim to be
wise, and so God has judged it unworthy of him to discover the truth; is to the
humble who do not presume of themselves and submit to the divine will, that
justice requires that he reveal his secrets.<span> 
</span></font><font size="3">He is cautious in the eyes of God, and truly careful of his salvation, who
prefers to his knowledge the law of God, which he sees supported not by the
proud noise of words, but on authentic testimonies of the divine power. And,
indeed, it is at once a folly and a vanity to put one's confidence in something
that has no support for the power of God. It is not therefore to the cultivated
minds of the age that God promises his kingdom, but to the faithful; it is not those
that examine the stars, but to those who do good that eternity is promised; it
is not to the dialecticians who endeavor to obscure the truth by their sophisms
and the subtlety of their reasonings that he grants glory, but to those who are
more careful to do well than to say well. God condemns those who prefer
brilliant speeches to good works. It is to want to bring back to oneself the
glory of God, to pretend to put on the truths of God the ornaments of the word.
These truths must please themselves, it is not the words that express them, it
is the very meaning of these words which is worthy of praise. If it is the meaning
that gives birth to the expressions, and if the words were invented only to
express the truth, why not express it purely and simply, so that it inspires us
more easily the desire to save our soul. That is why Our Lord has chosen as
apostles simple men, without letters and without ploys, by their perseverance
in faith and by a holy life, to burst in them the truth of God. This is what
makes the Apostle St. Paul say: "And I, my brethren, when I came, did not
come with the brilliance of eloquence and human wisdom.” (1 Cor. 2:1) And in
another place: “The kingdom of God does not consist in words but in virtue.” (1
Cor. 4:20) For words are subject to contradiction, but virtue makes a striking
witness to the law of God, and the most sublime speeches are lowered before it.
These considerations, my dear brothers, are made in the interest of the simple
minds who might think themselves unworthy of the grace of God, because they do
not know the secrets of oratorical art, while their simplicity is rather for
them a privilege; for what the wise men of the world do not see being blinded
by the pride of human science, simple souls believe it, because their prudence
consists not in words, but in true wisdom. They know that God rested
complacently in good works, and that he asks rather for faith rather than the
elegance of speeches: "On whom shall I rest," he says by his prophet,
"otherwise on the one who is humble and meek, and hears my words with
trembling?" (Isa. 66: 2) If we therefore want to be worthy of the rewards
we are promised, we must fulfill the Lord's commandments in the assurance that
God loves those who keep his words, which the Savior says to his disciples:
"If you love me, keep my commandments," (Jn. 14:15) so that after
being faithful servants of God we will become the heirs of His kingdom by Our
Lord Jesus Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  BREADS THAT WERE PERMITTED TO BE SLAUGHTERED? ONLY TO THE PRIESTS, AN EXAMPLE
  WHICH, FAR FROM JUSTIFYING THEM, MAKES THEM GUILTY OF THE SAME FAULT AS
  DAVID, WHO, MOREOVER, DID NOT DO THIS ACTION ON A SABBATH DAY (1 SAM. 21:4). </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The Savior wants to confuse the
  hypocrisy of the Jews with many examples. He therefore cites to them greater
  transgressions under the law without anyone having dared to accuse them, he
  shows the Sabbath violated several times in the law, the breads reserved for
  priests eaten by the priests by those who were not, and these transgressions
  having as authors men who enjoyed great authority under the law. The first
  was Joshua, the son of Nave, who, by the command of God himself, did not
  observe the Sabbath day and saw the walls of Jericho fall on his approach (Josh.
  1:20). It was therefore very useful to him to have obeyed the command of God
  rather than the Sabbath law. The Maccabees, defeated in a first battle,
  delivered a second on the Sabbath and triumphed over their enemies (1 Mac.
  2:38,41). David had already received the royal anointing and robbed the
  Philistine of his armies, whom he had killed by the power of God (1 Sam.
  21:1). Now, finding himself on a journey, pressed by hunger, he received from
  the hands of the high priest some bread which he was forbidden to eat; but
  this defense was only out of necessity, which permitted its use. The high
  priest, before this necessity, gave him these loaves, and David, the chosen
  of God, did not hesitate to take them. It is the same with the Sabbath, so it
  is not forbidden to give circumcision on the Sabbath. Commands whose
  violation does not entail any danger must be observed; but if there is
  necessity, or can transgress them without any danger, because they have been
  given rather to impress a certain respect than as necessary to salvation. On
  the contrary, what is forbidden absolutely is never allowed, and
  transgression, whatever the necessity, is always harmful. What laws prohibit
  as essentially bad is always forbidden. As for the precepts of which we have
  said that transgression is sometimes permitted, it is for example the ages of
  obligation, which we may not observe in case of necessity without being
  guilty, if we are authorized by the weakness of the stomach or disease. The
  Jews did not ignore it, and their accusation against the disciples of
  breaking the Sabbath law was not sincere. Now, the Savior did not wish to
  oppose to them the time of the law which touched his soul in order not to
  irritate them more, but he fights their calumnious accusation by examples
  taken in the past much more favorable for them in the defense of the Sabbath
  and, as we have said above, he confounds them not only on the Sabbath
  article, but on the breads reserved for priests. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  HOWEVER, THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT SEEM TO EXCUSE THE DISCIPLES, WHO CAN BE
  PREVARICATORS OF THE LAW AS WELL AS DAVID WAS.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> —The Savior would not refute the
  accusation of the Jews for this reason that the Sabbath law had ceased to be
  obligatory; he did not judge them worthy to hear openly the truth because of
  their unbelief. He thus opposed them with reasons borrowed at a time on which
  they rested with complacency, that is, at a time when the Sabbath law was in
  full force, to repel the accusation directed against his disciples. to tear
  off ears and grind them in their hands to eat them at a time when the Sabbath
  law had ceased to oblige. Our Lord, leaving aside this reason, shows them
  that in the very time when the law of the Sabbath had all its strength, the
  Sabbath law was broken in case of necessity. Thus David did what was not
  permitted him; Joshua did what the law forbade when he commanded his armed
  soldiers to go round Jericho for seven days; the Maccabees paid what was
  forbidden to them by defending on the Sabbath. And the priests, adds the
  Savior, violate the Sabbath in the temple and are not guilty. He thus shows
  that the accusation of the Jews against the disciples was for malice more
  than error, since despite these examples that they knew of holy personages
  who had deliberately violated the Sabbath, they did not leave any doubt to
  accuse innocent people. The law of the Sabbath was obligatory, but if
  necessity required it, one was not guilty by not observing it. So it was not
  forbidden to circumcise the Sabbath day because there was need. Thus the
  disciples took ears, which the ancient law forbade, but the hunger which
  pressed them legitimized this action. So again David, also hungry, did what
  he was not allowed, knowing that hunger excused him. It is the same today for
  the fasts prescribed by law. Is a sick person guilty of breaking the fast?
  No, no doubt, because this transgression is without any danger. It is
  sometimes allowed, such as breaking the Sabbath under the old law. What, on
  the contrary, is never permitted does not admit the excuse derived from
  necessity.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

AND TO THE LEPER WHOM HE DECLARES HIMSELF NOT TO BE OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD? (LUKE
7:17)</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The Savior's action finds its
justification in the nature of the fact itself. It was unreasonable indeed and
insulting to the promises made to the patriarchs, that a woman who did not
recognize the God of the Jews, received a favor promised to the nation that
adored her. Jesus began to deny her this grace. But as soon as she humbled herself
by believing in the words of the Savior, and confessed that the Jews who
believed were the children, and that the Gentiles were dogs or servitors, she
unites with the Lord's faith; for the servants suppose the master, and there is
no master without servants; from then on, the union settled between this woman
who submitted to God and the people who were subjected to it. That's why she
deserves what she asked for. As for the centurion, who immediately received
from the Savior the benefit he beseeched, he had for a long time occupied
himself with the things of God. Indeed, the chiefs of the Jews give him this
testimony before the Lord: "It is worthy that you grant him this grace,
and he has built us a synagogue." As for the leper, Our Lord calls him a
stranger not by his faith but by the nation to which he belonged. Indeed, he
was a Samaritan of those who were Babylonians of origin. And yet it was to the
confession of his faith that he had the benefit of his cure; for our Lord had
said to his disciples, “Go not to the nations, and do not go into the cities of
the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." (Matt.
10) That is to say, he recommends them to preach the gospel to the Jews who had
received the promise rather than to the Samaritans and Gentiles. But as soon as
the Jews began to reject the faith of Jesus Christ which was offered to them,
the Savior presented himself to the Samaritan woman, and to Cornelius the
Centurion after his crucifixion, while he contented himself with welcoming the
Cananean who sought him, because the time had not yet come to offer the
Gentiles the grace of salvation. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

75. </font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">WHY DOES THE LORD ONLY PAY THE
DIDRACHM FOR HIMSELF AND PETER, AND NOT FOR THE OTHER APOSTLES? SINCE ALL HAD
ABANDONED THEIR PROPERTY TO FOLLOW HIM, WAS HE NOT TO PAY THIS TRIBUTE FOR ALL?
</font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—<b> </b></font><font size="3">This didrachm was a personal tribute,
not the tax on the property of each. (This tax was called rags gold, because it
was demanded of the poor themselves.) For the Savior possessed nothing in this
world, though he was putting it out of the world. After his death, he was
buried at the expense of others; and we, to whom the world is a stranger,
desire to increase our goods; it is thus that in dying we attest not only by
our words, but by our writings, that we have invaded the world, and that our
own declaration makes us condemn by the sovereign matter of this world. This is
why the Lord says in the Gospel: "He who has not abandoned all things to
follow me cannot be my disciple." (Luke 14:26) Therefore whoever possesses
the goods of this world without placing his hope in it, and being willing to
renounce it for faith, walks in the way that leads to our Lord Jesus Christ.
This tribute was therefore demanded of those who traded or practiced any
profession. Now, since neither the Savior nor his disciples were involved in
any of the affairs of this world, we should not ask them this tax. But as the
demon was constantly in ambush to seize the opportunity to triumph over the
Savior, he seized the soul of the collectors of the didrachm to make them the
instruments of his will and inspire them to go find Peter, the first of the
apostles, and to tell him that their master had to pay this tax when they were
perfectly discharged; for they did not engage in any of the occupations of the
world. Since the Savior did not have enough to pay this tax, the devil wanted
to make it scandalous or force him to lower himself to beg another to pay for
him. It was then that Our Lord, to show that the devil, in his improvidence,
was weaving out frames where he was to be taken himself, commanded his apostle
to go to the seashore, to open the mouth of the first fish he would find and
take the coin required for this tax. In paying for this tribute, he not only
avoided scandalizing those who were in charge of collecting it, and he did not
need to go so far as to ask others to pay for him, but he gave proof of his
great power by drawing to himself those who were in the chains of the devil, to
make him find his torment in his own inventions and in his ploys. The
collectors of the didrachma therefore told the apostle Saint Peter: "Your
master does not pay the tribute, etc.; And they went to find his master to make
him pay this tax for all the disciples. The Savior, in commanding to pay him
for Peter and for himself, seems to pay him for all his disciples; for just as
they were all in the Savior as the disciples in their master, so after the
Savior they were all combined in Peter; "For our Lord made him to be their
leader and the shepherd of the Lord's flock. In this way, Jesus said to his
disciples, Watch and pray so as not to enter into temptation.” (Matt. 26:41)
But to Peter he says: "Behold, Satan has desired to sift you like wheat,
and I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail, and you, when you are
converted, strengthen your brothers.” (Luke 22:3l) What doubt can remain? He
prayed for Peter and did not pray for James and John, not to mention others. It
is evident that they were all combined with Peter; for when he prays for Peter,
one must recognize that he prays for all other disciples. It is always, in
fact, in the one at his head that the people receive reproaches or praises. And
our Lord Himself says in another place, "I pray for those whom my Father
has given me, and be with me where I am." (Jn. 17:9,24)</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THAT YOUR FLIGHT WILL NOT COME IN WINTER OR ON THE SABBATH”; SINCE THE TIME OF
THIS PERSECUTION CANNOT BE DIVIDED, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE APOSTLE:
"THE MAN OF SIN, THE SON OF PERDITION," HE SAYS, "WILL BE
REVEALED IN HIS DAY”; (2 THESS. 2:3) AND HE SAYS AGAIN IN THE ACTS OF THE
APOSTLES: "DETERMINING THE TIMES OF THE DURATION OF PEOPLES AND THE LIMITS
OF THEIR ABODE?” (ACTS 17) WHY, THEN, DOES THE SAVIOR LET US UNDERSTAND THAT IT
IS NOT GOOD TO FLEE IN THE WINTER OR ON THE SABBATH?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — The flight during the winter is
not exempt from danger, the cold, the continual rains, the snow, the frost, the
overflowing of the rivers, are all obstacles which make the flight very
difficult. You cannot seek refuge in forests, mountains, or caves. On the
Sabbath day, the Jews could not get far from the city or climb the mountains,
and by the same escape was impossible that day. Now, just as these two
circumstances leave all safety to flight because of the obstacles we have
pointed out; thus our flight will not be safe from danger if this persecution
finds us chained in servitude to the hindrances of the flesh. Indeed, the
desires of the age or the goods of this world are so many chains that hold
captive men and prevent them from escaping the tyrannical treatments of the
devil. We must therefore pray that the difficulties of winter and the Sabbath
do not come in the time when we will have to flee, but that God has relieved us
of these obstacles and gives us his help, to destroy in us all desire that
would make us slaves of the world. As the Savior spoke of the last persecution
of which the Antichrist is the author, he takes as a term of comparison the
winter which is the last season of the year, and the Sabbath which is the last
day of the week, for us to make it clear that if flight is painful and
difficult in these two circumstances, the persecutions and trials of this last
time will be so heavy and so overwhelming that there will be hardly anyone who
can escape it.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

OUR LORD, HANG HIMSELF BEFORE THE SAVIOR'S PASSION?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — Our Lord was delivered into the
hands of his enemies, and it was on the morning of the day of preparation, when
all the princes of the priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people,
gathered in the house of Caiaphas, where they knew that they had to bring Jesus
in order to hear him. This is what the Evangelists St. Matthew and St. Mark
report, and from their story none of them went out of the house of Caiaphas
before this work of impiety was consummated, for all their zeal, all their
religion for Passover celebration had only one object, the death of the Savior.
But since the princes of the priests were busy from the morning until the ninth
hour to press the execution of the death of the Savior, how could one admit
that Judas had postponed the price of his betrayal to them before the
crucifixion and that he had told them in the temple: "I sinned, delivering
innocent blood?” (Matt. 27:4) It is certain, indeed, that not all princes of
priests and elders of the people were in the temple before the death of the
Savior, and one proof is that they insulted when he was on the cross. It cannot
be concluded either from what this fact is told before the passion of Our Lord;
for it is a great number of facts which, although having passed before, are
nevertheless recounted last, just as when the opportunity arises, the sacred
writers anticipate the narrative of a fact which took place only after. Thus it
is evident that Psalm fifty is earlier than the third. It sometimes happens
that later events are told in anticipation. So again it is proved that Mary
after the resurrection of her brother Lazarus, six days before the feast of
Easter, had scattered perfumes on the feet of the Lord in a feast, and the Evangelist
anticipates the story of this fact because of its signification. Mary, he says,
was the one who spread perfumes on the Lord. (Jn. 11:2) St. John tells this
fact before Lazarus' death, and if we did not learn that it took place after,
we would not know when it place it. Perhaps it might be said that Judas
postponed the money at the ninth hour, and seeing the Savior put to death, the
torn veil of the temple, the earth quaking, the rocks breaking, the elements
upset (Matt. 27:51), he conceived under the inspiration of fear, the repentance
of his crime. But at the ninth hour, the elders and princes of the priests were
entirely, it seems to me, preparing for the Passover that they were to
celebrate on the evening of that day. Besides, the law forbade carrying money
on the Sabbath. I believe, therefore, that the day or the time when Judas hung
himself cannot be fixed in a plausible way.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  AT THE THIRD HOUR?</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—
  It is not good to wrap the truth in obscure language. The three evangelists
  had only one thought, but Saint Mark wanted to mention a circumstance they
  had omitted and thought necessary. Indeed, it can not be supposed that this
  evangelist who, following the example of the other sacred writers, was
  educated with a deep sense of religion and a scrupulous care of what he
  wrote, and who was inspired by the Holy Spirit, could have made a mistake. It
  is therefore necessary to examine what his purpose was in expressing himself
  in this way. Let us first consider that it was not by Pilate but by the Jews
  that the Savior was crucified, for, according to the Roman laws, he declared
  that Jesus was innocent. Is not he the one who says to the Jews, "I find
  no crime in him?” (Jn. 19:4) They cry to him, "Crucify him,” and he
  answers them, What crime hath he done? Finally, as he insisted and wished to
  draw it from their hands, they had recourse to this slanderous accusation:
  "If you deliver this man you are not Caesar's friend, for whoever makes
  himself king, is decreed against Caesar. It is then that He gives them the
  Savior to be judged by them. Pilate did not pronounce the sentence, but the
  Jews. It was at the instigation of the leaders of the priests, says the
  evangelist, that they shouted to him: "Let him be crucified.” St. Mark
  therefore wished to make us understand that the sentence was pronounced at
  the third hour, when they repeated with their repeated cries that Jesus was
  crucified within the interval of nearly three hours, during which Jesus was
  taken to Herod's house and brought back to Pilate. In fact, every man
  condemned to death is regarded as dead from the moment the death sentence has
  been sentenced to him. St. Mark thus clearly establishes that it is not by
  virtue of the judge's sentence that Jesus was crucified; for it is difficult
  to prove the innocence of one who is condemned by a judicial sentence. He
  spoke in a different way to tell us that what was done in the sixth hour, not
  by law, but by the persevering malice of the Jews, began at the third hour. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  — It is not good to wrap the truth in obscure language. The agreement of the
  three evangelists is proof that they have spoken the truth. As to St. Mark,
  his account indicates that he wished to make known to us a circumstance which
  remained hidden. For it cannot be supposed that this evangelist, who, like
  the other sacred authors, had learned with as much religion as care what he
  should write, has fallen into error. We must therefore carefully examine what
  he wanted to teach us by expressing himself in this way. For it is not
  without reason that he departs here from the three other evangelists. Let us
  consider whether those who claim that the sentence was pronounced at the
  third hour, and that therefore the Savior was crucified at this time, are not
  right, although they cannot prove the truth of their feeling. They see this
  truth, but they do not know how to establish it. Let us, then, leave Pilate's
  person for a moment and see how far the sentence pronounced against the
  Savior can be traced, and we shall see then whether we can admit as true the
  sentiment of which we have just spoken. It is certain that it was at the
  instigation of the priests of the priests that the Jews demanded that
  Barabbas be delivered to them on the day of the feast, and that Jesus was
  crucified. Pilate resisted them long because he wanted to deliver the Savior;
  He returned and went out several times to speak to the Jews and tell them
  that he found no crime in him that was worthy of death. But the Jews insisted
  with greater force by shouting, "Let him be crucified. There was
  therefore a certain space of time during which Jesus was exposed to the
  mockery of the soldiers, who presented him to the people, clothed him with a
  rag of purple, and crowned with thorns, worshipped him in mockery, they spat
  in his face, flogged him, and suffered him, which led him to the sixth hour
  when Jesus was crucified. He was brought to Pilate, Pilate went out to come
  to the Jews, because they did not enter the courtroom themselves. He spoke to
  them, heard their false accusations, and sent Jesus to Herod. Then he came
  back, questioned again Jesus who answered him; then he went out again to the
  Jews and declared to them that he found no cause of death in the Savior. We
  had arrived at the third hour. Then the Jews told Pilate who wanted to
  deliver Jesus, "Let him be crucified.” Pilate resisted them for a long
  time, but being unable to obtain anything, he left Jesus at their will about
  the sixth hour, as the Evangelist expressly said: "He gave him to them
  to do what they wanted.” It is therefore true to say that the sentence of
  death was pronounced at the third hour, because it was not pronounced by
  Pilate, but by the Jews. Pilate consented to it only with regret and in spite
  of himself because of the perilous intimation that they sounded in his ears:
  "If you deliver him, you are not Caesar's friend." Let us see what
  St. Mark wanted to show that it was not by the sentence of the judge that the
  Savior had been condemned, because it is difficult for him who is sentenced
  by a truly judicial sentence, not to appear put to death with justice.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the world began and the day becomes longer than the night. As he lived in the
middle of the Roman Empire, he had to suffer the eighth day of the calends of
April, time of the equinox of the Romans. It was then, in fact, that the reader
spread over this part of the world and the day began to grow. The passion of
the Savior led him from darkness to light. The conduct of the Creator is
therefore safe from blame, since he repaired his fallen creature at the very

  days and nights, you will not be able to understand these words: Moses has
  hunted forty days and forty nights (Exod. 24:18); However, this number is not
  entirely present, for the day on which he ascended, and the day on which he
  descended, are not strictly part of it. But the custom is not to count the
  night without counting the day, not to count either the day without the
  night, taking the part for the whole. It is in this sense that the Savior
  said, "As Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the
  whale, so the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of
  the earth.” (Matt. 12:40) As there were three nights, there are also three
  days. Night is mentioned not to appear to express something new and contrary
  to reason, since night is a consequence of the day. There is no doubt that
  the evening which is followed by the night was established before the light
  that gave birth to the day, and nothing absurd is advanced in asserting that
  the passion of the Lord began with the night. Just as light, that is, day, is
  the image of life, so night, that is, darkness, is the symbol of death; it is
  thus that Scripture itself establishes a striking contrast between the children
  of light and the children of darkness. Now, it is not surprising that
  although, always and everywhere, the day is placed before night, the light
  before darkness; here, however, the things which follow are placed before
  those which preceded them, or that in the present case the order is reversed,
  as we have already remarked. Indeed, the night seems much cleaner to be the
  image of death than the day. Death thus begins with the night, because it was
  impossible to find another way than by night in the empire of the prince of
  darkness and to triumph over him. It was necessary for the Lord of light,
  that is, of eternal life, to be for a moment subject to the prince of
  darkness or death, in order to become the liberator of all those upon whom
  death had reigned in the past, or would like to expand his empire in the
  future. Neither death would have been entirely destroyed, nor the clouds of
  darkness would have been dispelled, had it not been for the Lord to enter his
  empire. Before this bright light, the secret of death, in which all his
  strength was, vanishes, and one can only triumph entirely over him who is
  caught by his own arms or in his own domains. It is therefore by a design
  full of wisdom that in this great drama the night gets the pre-eminence to
  lose all its power. So that the unbelieving Jews would remain wrapped up in
  an eternal night, and that the day would not appear the author of so great a
  crime, of so enormous sacrilege, but of the night; the day against the
  natural order of things is submitted to the preceding night, just as the God
  and Lord of all things is subject to the prince of death, in order to deliver
  all men from the chains of death. If anyone were tempted to see here again
  some contradiction, which he considers to moderate his appreciation, that God
  in putting on the form, I will not say of the man, but of the servant, has
  voluntarily surrendered to the death. Why, then, demand that order be
  followed, the place where you see in all things this reversed order? For what
  is this light that has him in the darkness, and that the darkness have not
  understood? (Jn. 1:5) It is the Lord of light who allowed us to seize his
  person. Now, whoever knows that he is seized by him to put him to death,
  counts from this moment the time of his death. That night follows the day he
  was judged and crucified. Then comes the night that ends on the Sabbath and
  the Sabbath itself. There is still the evening following the Sabbath. This is
  why Moses had given the Jews the figurative precept to begin the Sabbath day
  in the evening, in which the Lord is risen and who embraces the whole day of
  Sunday, for there is no night without day or day without night. With this
  explanation we understand that the resurrection of Our Lord took place after
  three days and three nights. </font></span></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  THESE WORDS OF THE SAVIOR, THAT HE WOULD RISE FROM THE DEAD AFTER THREE DAYS
  AND THREE NIGHTS, SINCE AFTER SUFFERING THE TORMENTS OF HIS PASSION ON THE
  DAY OF THE LORD'S SUPPER, HE RESURRECTED FIRST LIGHT OF SUNDAY WHEN DARKNESS</font></span></span></span><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">

  NIGHTS DOES NOT SEEM TO FIT. </font></a><font size="3">— The Savior, who foresaw all that was to
  happen to him, made this statement loudly, he knew with no doubt that the
  Jews would seize him to put him to death, and that he would oppose no
  resistance. to their sacrilegious effects, while it was so easy for them to
  thwart them. Was not he already their captive when he healed the ear of the
  high priest's servant whom Peter had cut off with a sword? He showed them
  that his humiliations were not the result of his weakness, but that by a
  providential disposition he yielded for a time to their criminal will to
  destroy thus the kingdom of hell. Indeed, the demon, in his improvidence,
  slipped into the soul of the Jews to push them to put the Savior to death, as
  if he had to win by being the life to him who taught the way of truth; and he
  did not know that death must turn against himself. It was then that he
  triumphed at the sight of the servitude in which the man had fallen as a
  result of his sin, that he was convinced of the crime of having put to death
  the innocent Christ, held captive among the sinners he who did not know sin,
  and thus lost the very ones on whom his power was stretched in the
  underworld. It is in the divine prescience that the Savior had of all these
  things that he counts for his death the night he was taken by his enemies. In
  fact, every prisoner who has no hope of escaping the hands of his judge sees
  himself as dead even before the blow that must hit him. Add to this night the
  day of his passion and the next night. Add the Sabbath by joining the night
  that ends with the dawn of Sunday and Sunday itself, and you have the full
  number of days predicted by the Lord. For it was the last night, when the
  darkness still covered the earth and the day was just beginning to dawn, that
  the Savior rose between light and darkness, so that the night was counted as
  the day and so the prediction that he had done was done in his integrity.</font></span></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  A HOUSE, HE DESIRED THAT NO ONE SHOULD KNOW IT, BUT HE COULD NOT REMAIN
  HIDDEN?" WANTED TO REMAIN HIDDEN AND THAT HE COULD NOT; WAS HIS WILL MADE
  POWERLESS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— It
  is impossible that the will of the Savior will not have its effect, and he
  can only want what must be done, we must admit that he wanted everything that
  was done because his will never go beyond the power of his nature. The is
  therefore irreproachable as its nature. The fact referred to was over the
  confines of Tyre; Jesus entered a house and he did not want anyone to know
  it. Now, one asks how and for what reason he wished that one did not know his
  arrival. Note that this fact has its place on the confines of Gentiles, to
  whom the Gospel was not yet to be preached. When he gave his mission to his
  disciples, he said to them, "Go not to the nations, neither enter the
  cities of the Samaritans; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
  Israel. (Matt. 10:5) So he would not let anyone know that he was in that
  house, he did not want to be sought, but he gladly welcomed those who came
  forward; for although the time of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles had
  not yet come, yet there would have been something bad not to receive those
  who came spontaneously to embrace the faith. Thus it was not the disciples
  who knew the coming of the Savior, but those who saw him enter the house, who
  spread the news of his coming. It was thus known that he was in this house,
  and all who wished to obtain any benefit entered it. Our Lord, therefore, did
  not wish his disciples to know that he was in this house, but he wanted to be
  sought after, and that was indeed the case; for he could not remain hidden
  once it was known that he had entered this house. Thus, as soon as the Chananean
  had heard of his arrival, she hastened to come to him and beg him to cast the
  demon out of her daughter's body (Matt. 15:22), and she certainly would not
  have obtained this grace if it had not previously been submitted by faith to
  the God of the Jews. The will of the Savior has been accomplished according

  TO EXPLAIN THE STORY OF THE EVANGELIST ST. MARK, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE WILL

  to make its meaning more hidden, has passed over the confines of Tyre. The Lord
  having thus arrived on the confines of Tyre entered a house. As the time had
  not yet come to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, he forbade anyone to let
  him know his arrival, that is to say, he did not want anyone to know it. It
  must be understood that he did not wish his disciples to teach him that he
  was in this house, he did not wish to be sought, because the time had not
  come to offer grace to the Gentiles. Now this woman came, and having heard
  that Jesus was there by those who had seen him come into this house, begged
  him to cast out the devil from his daughter's body. But the Savior, who knew
  that the time had not yet come to give grace to the Gentiles, replied:
  "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not permitted to take
  the children's bread and give it to the dogs. (Matt. 15:26.) This woman
  surrendered to the Savior's response and obtained the benefit she desired. By
  this acquiescence in the words of Jesus, she professed to unite with the God
  of the Jews. This is the reason why he would not let anyone know from his
  disciples that he was in this house, and the thing took place as he pleased.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

26. </font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">WE READ IN THE GOSPEL THAT THE
ANGEL PREDICTED TO MARY, MOTHER OF THE LORD, THAT THE REIGN OF CHRIST WOULD “HAVE
NO END.”<span>  </span></font><font size="3">DANIEL MAKES THE SAME
PREDICTION: "THEN WILL ARISE AN ETERNAL KINGDOM THAT WILL NEVER BE
DESTROYED.” ON THE CONTRARY, THE APOSTLE SPEAKING OF THE LORD SAYS: "WHEN
HE HAS GIVEN HIS KINGDOM TO GOD HIS FATHER” (1 CORINTHIANS 15); HOW WILL HIS
KINGDOM BE ETERNAL, SINCE HE MUST GIVE IT TO GOD HIS FATHER? </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— In so saying, the Son does not
lose the kingdom by giving it to his Father, and so these words of the Apostle
are true, without the angel and Daniel being in contradiction with them.
Whoever thinks it their duty to call in question their testimony would bring
unbelief to an excess. But we, whose faith cannot be shaken, see how it is to
be understood that the Son hands the kingdom over to his Father, which the
Apostle in another place explains in these terms: "Then the Son Himself
will be subject to him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all
in all." (1 Cor.15) This submission is the very act of surrender of the
kingdom, so here is the interpretation that it is necessary to admit, not to
deny that the Son is subject to his Father, and yet to recognize that his
kingdom is eternal, that is to say, the kingdom of the Son, for in the name of
Jesus every knee shakes in heaven, on the earth, and in hell. (Philip. 2) The
Apostle St. Peter confirms this truth when he says:" No other name under
heaven was given to men by which we were to be saved." (Acts 4) And did
not the Lord Himself say to His disciples, “Until now you have not asked
anything in my name, ask and I will answer you?" (Jn. 16) The reign of the
Son therefore consists in the fact that it is in his name that all men are
saved, and that all the prayers addressed to him until the end of the world are
answered. But when all creatures have confessed Jesus Christ willingly or by
force, and have been subjected to the power against which they have resisted,
then the mystery of one God will be revealed to all men, and all thanksgivings
will go back to God the Father, the principle of all things, that all preaching
cease, one God be recognized in the mystery of the Trinity. Indeed, when all
the powers, all the principalities and the dominions will have bowed their knee
before Jesus Christ, then the Son will reveal that it is not the first
principle from which all things come, but his Son in whom we see the Father.
This is how he submits and gives the kingdom to his Father. In revealing that
his Father is the first principle of all things, he submits to him by declaring
that he comes from him. Indeed, the advent of the Son of God is surrounded by
so much majesty and splendor that all the powers and choirs of the angels could
believe that he is the only God par excellence. Now, the Savior declaring that
he is not the one who is called the Father, but his Son, while continuing to
reign, hands the kingdom over to his Father. Here we see both submission and
surrender of the kingdom, for when he declares that he comes from the Father,
he declares by the same that all that he has also comes from the Father,
bringing everything back to him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

73. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHAT DO THESE WORDS OF SIMEON MEAN
TO MARY, MOTHER OF OUR LORD: "THIS IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE RUIN AND FOR THE
RESURRECTION OF MANY IN ISRAEL.... AND THE SWORD WILL PIERCE YOUR SOUL SO THAT
THE THOUGHTS HIDDEN IN THE BOTTOM HEARTS OF MANY ARE REVEALED?" </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— Simeon, that holy personage, of
whom the divine Scriptures praise, reveals by divine inspiration what Jesus
Christ will be for men, a principle of fall and ruin for those who look at each
other, as unshakeable in the observance and knowledge of the law, but who do
not believe in the works of Jesus Christ, and have no part in the promises made
to their fathers; a principle of resurrection for those who did not enjoy any
kind of consideration in the law, but who believed in Jesus Christ, that is to
say that God made worthy of him those who were regarded as unworthy and useless
and that he reproved those who seemed great in the world. It is this same truth
that Our Lord expresses in another place: "I have come into this world for
judgment, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be
made blind. (John 9:39) And in fact, it is not the teachers of the law, nor the
Pharisees, nor the scribes who have followed Jesus Christ, but ignorant and
uneducated sinners. This is what made the Savior says: "My Father, I give
you thanks, because you have hid these things from the wise and the prudent,
and have revealed them to the little ones." (Matt. 11:25) As for what
Simeon adds: "And the sword will pierce your soul, so that the thoughts
hidden in the depths of the hearts of many will be revealed," (Luke 2: 35)
indicates that Mary, in whose bosom the mystery of the incarnation has been
wrought, and there has been some doubt at the death of Our Lord, but doubts
that the resurrection's brilliancy and the Savior's power soon changed into a
firm and unshakable faith. At the death of the Savior, all under an impression
of dread, let doubt enter their souls. However, they did not persevere in
doubt. The sword only crosses the soul if doubt does not remain in thought; but
he emerges from it by the force of the soul, which regains its rights. Who
would not have been able to doubt, seeing the one who called himself the Son of
God humiliated to death? But as I said, the resurrection of the Savior was to
remove all doubt; that is why it is said that the sword will pass and not that
it will fall on the heart, or that it will reach some member in passing. A line
which is thrown and passes near a man may erase it, but without hurting it; so
doubt was to produce sadness, but not until death, because it did not remain in
the soul and it simply went through it, touching the hearts of the disciples
like a shadow. See Cleophas and this other disciple who went to Emmaus; they
were sad in the way, and told the Savior himself that they did not know him
again: “We thought he was the one to deliver Israel.” They doubted then, but
scarcely had they recognized the Lord that this doubt vanished. It is also said
of Joseph that "iron shook his soul." (Ps 104:18) For a long time
held in chains despite his innocence, it is not surprising that he could have
doubted God's righteousness towards him, but as his hope in God was stronger,
he could not persevere in doubt. Everyone is judged on the vice for which he
has the most inclination. The Apocalypse of St. John confirms this truth,
"Those who doubt," he said, "and the unbelievers will have their
share in the lake burning with fire and brimstone.” (Rev. 21:8) He who
therefore does not persevere in doubt is delivered from death, that is to say,

UNTIL JOHN THE BAPTIST, FROM WHOM THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN WAS PREACHED, FOR IT
WAS HE WHO INAUGURATED THIS NEW PREACHING, WHY DID HIS BAPTISM CEASE?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — The baptism of John, once
instituted, has not ceased to be given; it only added what was missing. In
fact, John only baptized, but did not give the Holy Spirit to those who
believed, as he says of the Savior, "For me, I baptize you in water for
penitence, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 3, Mark 1, Luke
3) That is, it is through my baptism that the forgiveness of sins is granted,
but not the Holy Spirit who gives to those who have been purified the name and
the rights of children of God; for it was a prerogative reserved for the
Savior, as for the Lord God, that men should not become children of God until
the Son of God gave them the Holy Spirit. The effect tacitly produced by John's
baptism without any question concerning the Savior, although his name was
pronounced, received all his strength from the Trinity. This is what the
Savior's goodness teaches us by establishing the consecrated formula of the
three names which from the beginning contributed to the same works under the
name and person of one God. The name of the three divine persons came therefore
to join the baptism of John with the expression of the mystery for so long
hidden. God still communicates to this baptism a much more precious grace, it
is that those who were baptized became children of God by receiving the Holy
Spirit. This baptism was thus enriched with new graces, but was not suppressed.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

105.</font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> HOW TO RECONCILE THE PROPHECIES
WITH THE GOSPEL ON THE OBSCURATION OF THE SUN AND ON SOME OTHER POINTS?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — The prophets predicted that at
the first advent of the Lord, the sun would be darkened in the time of his
passion, at the very time when, according to the Evangelists, the fact
occurred, that is to say at noon. This is what the prophet Amos says: "In
that day, says the Lord, the sun will disappear at midday, and the earth will
be covered with darkness in the midst of the light." (Amos 8:9) The sun
was thus darkened that day until the ninth hour, and the prophet's prediction
was fulfilled. God wanted to give in the Savior's passion an image of what
should happen at his second coming, because when he comes to judge the world,
the stars will cease to give their accustomed light, according to these words
of the Lord himself: "In those days the sun will be darkened and the moon
will not shed its light." (Matt. 24:29) The prophet Joel also predicted
this phenomenon so that one cannot doubt the fulfillment of a fact attested by
several witnesses. “And the sun,” he says, “will be changed into darkness and
the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord’s coming.”
(Joel 2:31) As far as the literal meaning of these words indicates, they seem
to be more fitting for the second advent, for then the Lord will manifest
himself publicly to all men, to the testimony of Scripture: "Then every
eye will see him, and all the tribes of the earth and those who have crucified him
will strike their breast.” (Rev. 1:7) Now, if according to the oracles of the
prophets the sun is to be covered with darkness in the two events of the Lord,
what is the day when, according to the prophet Isaiah, the sun and the moon
must shine with greater brilliance?" The highest mountains, the highest
hills will be sprinkled with streams of running water after the days of
carnage, after the fall of the towers. The light of the moon will shine like
the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter in
the day when the Lord will close the plague of his people and heal their
wounds, etc." (Isa. 30:25-26) What is this day when the Lord promised to
close the plague of his people? I think that this is the day that Zachariah,
father of John the Baptist, sang: "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel,
because he has visited us, and has delivered his people, and has raised the
sign of salvation in the house of David his servant, as he promised through the
mouth of his holy prophets, who were in the beginning, to save us from our
enemies and from the hand of all who lower us to fulfill His mercies towards
our fathers." (Luke 1:68, etc.) Simeon also said, "This is
established for the ruin and for the resurrection of many in Israel." (Luke
2:34) He wants to talk about the ruin of the Scribes, the Pharisees and the
main Jews who are represented by the towers in the prophet's prediction. And
while their unbelief was the cause of their ruin, others arose by the faith
that negligence retained powerlessness and infirmity. That is why the Savior
said: "I have come to this world for judgment, that those who do not see shall
see, and those who see, blind; (Jn. 9:39) That is to say, those whom their
knowledge and skill in the law made shine like lights became blind and the eyes
of the blind, that is to say ignorant and publicans, open to the light by
faith. So the prophet foretold that the Savior would take care of their
infirmities, and this prophecy is fulfilled in his time, as we see in the
Gospel: "He really has borne our torpor, of our sufferings.” (Isa. 1:4)
All these predictions have received their consummation and fulfillment in the
Savior's passion, and thus the salvation of the human race has been done in a
true way for those who were on earth or in hell, for the prophecy of Zachariah
embraces both of them at once. On earth, men have been freed from the oppression
of their enemies by the intervention of the mercy of God, and in hell they were
delivered from the sorrows they endured. Indeed, all those who hoped in Christ
who had been promised to them awaited the coming of him who was to triumph over
death and deliver them from hell. This is why Zechariah says: “To fulfill his
mercies toward our fathers." (Luke 1:72) But if it is understood that this
salvation must also come in the second advent, but it is especially in the
second that the sun will be covered with darkness and the moon will not give
its light, how to admit that the light of the sun and the moon will shine more
brightly in the day when God will visit his people, since, in one as in the
other time when the deliverance of this people begins and ends, we read that
not only the light of the sun and the moon will be weakened, but that these
stars will be completely obscured. We must therefore understand that the sun
and the moon represent the saints here, just as in another place they are
compared to the stars of heaven, to the testimony of the Apostle St. Paul, who
declares that the saints shine in this world like the stars of the faith. We
also read in the Gospel that the righteous will shine like the sun (Matt.
13:43), because the Lord compares good works to light. "May your
light," he says, "shine before men, so that when you see your good
works they will glorify your Father, who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:16) Therefore
those who have abandoned all their goods to follow the Lord, owe to their
justice and holiness, to be compared to the sun and the moon seven times
brighter. "There is no one," says the Savior, "who has left
either his house, or his wife, or his children, or his fields, which has
received seven times as much in this world.” (Luke 18:29) Now those who receive
here seven times as much honor will be in the other life seven times brighter
than the rest, that is, their resurrection will be like the sun and the moon
and the resurrection of others like the stars. The glory of the saints who
receives here seven times of brilliance, will receive seven times more in the
resurrection, that is to say, that he who has here below the brightness of the
moon will receive in the other life the brightness of the sun, and the one here
below as bright as the sun will shine seven times brighter in the other life.
The prophet Isaiah therefore rightly uses the comparison of the sun and the
moon to predict the increase of the glory of the saints. If indeed our Lord is
called the sun of righteousness, and the saints must be like him, to the
testimony of the apostle St. John: “When he appears, we shall be like him."
(1 Jn. 3:2) The prophet is right in comparing the saints with the sun, but
pointing out that the brightness of the sun is seven times greater than that of
the moon. When he predicts that the light of the moon will have the same
brightness as that of the sun, but that the sunlight will be seven times
brighter, he wants us to understand that the light of the moon will become
seven times brighter to match that of the sun, that is, the moon will be as
bright as the sun is now. Although the application of this comparison of the
stars to the saints is in the opposite direction, yet it brings out in part the
increase of their glory, that is to say, after the increase of the light of the
sun and the moon, and the distance that will exist between one saint and
another after they have received their reward will be as great as that which
separates them in the present life.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

84. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHY DO WE, WHO ARE KEEPING THE
PASSOVER FEAST BY THE PHASE OF THE MOON, REPROACH THE PAGANS FOR OBSERVING THE
DAYS AND THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE MOON? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— Far from Christians the reproach
of worshiping the stars, who have received from God a spiritual worship which
teaches them to despise the things that appear, to unite with the invisible and
celestial things, and to rise above all created objects to heaven, where they
must be eternally with the angels of God. As for the worshipers of the stars,
they will be with them or even under them; for how to place a man above what
has been the object of his adoration? It is not therefore the course of the
moon that the pagans observe, it is the moon itself, which they adore as a
divinity. They imagine that they have discovered the influence of its different
phases, and they decide accordingly what they will have to do or omit on
certain days, by categorically submitting their conduct and all their life to
its realm. Now, it is a recklessness in direct opposition to the order of God
and which makes them fall, as we see, into frequent errors. God has established
the stars to determine the times. We therefore observe the number of days of
the moon, but we do not worship it, and we specify the time of the Passover on
the fourteenth day of the moon, which is the first according to here. All
things that God has done have a character of fullness; We are therefore
permitted to celebrate the Passover for seven days, from the fourteenth day of
the moon until the twenty-first, so as to contain in this space seven days from
the preparation of the Passover until the resurrection of the Savior, avoiding
that the passion falls on the thirteenth day, or the resurrection the
fourteenth or the fifteenth, so that passion may not be celebrated before the
first moon in our day, nor resurrection on another day than the day when the
world was created. In fact, all the times that regulate the course of the world
are included in the space of a single week, because it is in the space of seven
days that God has given to the world the form and brightness that we admire it.
He created the world in six days and stopped creating the seventh day, which we
call Sabbath. These seven days include all the reason and the different numbers
of the world. By continually returning to themselves, they give rise to the
multiplication of times. After the Sabbath, the week begins again from the
first day until the seventh, that is to say until the Sabbath, to teach us that
the resurrection of the Lord was made the first day of the creation of the
world, that we call the day of the Lord. God did it together with the evening,
and after a seven-day revolution, he comes back again to be the first day of a
new week. Things were thus regulated from the beginning in view of the
mysteries of the incarnation of the Lord, of his passion and resurrection; for
the resurrection of the body of the Lord was the resurrection, the repair of
the world almost entirely. It is therefore well established that we do not
worship the moon, but we observe the number of days that are marked by the
course of the moon. The devil, therefore, who is the same as Satan, to give
some authority to his deceptions and to put his lies in the colors of the
truth, in the first month that he knows that we must celebrate the mysteries of
the Lord, uses his power, which is great, to establish among the pagans
mysteries which he also commands them to celebrate. he thus holds their minds
in error for two reasons. As his lies precede the truth, he thus gives them superiority
over her, and he makes this antiquity a prejudgment unfavorable to the truth.
Secondly; as it is in the first month when the Romans place, like us, the
equinox, that the pagans celebrate these sacrifices and affirm that the
atonement is made by blood, as we say it is made by the cross; the devil, by
this ploy, restrains them in error, persuades them that our truth is only an
imitation of the truth and a superstition which we have invented in a spirit of
rivalry. For, they say, one cannot look upon what is later invention as true.
But miracles and wonders testify that we are certainly in possession of the
truth, and the brilliance of these miracles sets us in all its glory. Since
this proof is indeed the only one that easily convinces, God has opposed it to
the ploys and tricks of the devil to reveal his lies. Who could, even if it
were an enemy of the Christian religion, deny that the truth is where the
divine power is revealed in all its strength?</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Our Lord, foreseeing the war that the Jews were going to declare on him,
recommends to his disciples to arm themselves with swords. They obeyed this
order, and when this impious war began under the leadership of Judas Iscariot,
Peter, seeing the enemies ready to throw himself on his master, drew his sword
and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. This order, and when this

the Lord commanded Peter to put his sword in his sheath, "For all
those," he says, "who use the sword will perish by the sword.: (Matt.
26:52) Why does he command to prepare swords since he forbids using them and
even threatens to kill anyone who has struck with the sword? The Apostle,
however, seems to have acted in all justice, for he has struck the man whom he
saw armed against him. It was a duty for him to resist ungrateful servants who
were armed to put the Savior to death. If you examine every circumstance of
this fact, of which you ask the explanation, you will find other questions.
What, indeed, was it that the one who had for support a very spiritual force
should make his disciples prepare material weapons, and that after forbidding
them to carry in their journey neither purse, nor money, nor baton he now
revokes his defense? Let us begin by explaining why Our Lord commands his
disciples to arm themselves with swords and forbids them to use them. It was
not only against his enemies, but in the interests of his disciples themselves
that he commanded them to obtain arms for the war that was about to break out. It
must have been a new and surprising sight that the author of so many unusual
and extraordinary prodigies suddenly fell into an excess of humiliations that
subjected him to ill-treatment and death. Now, to show that these sufferings
had not surprised him in the unforeseen, and as a man reduced to impotence, he
predicted the advantages, thus showing that he had not the least doubt, but
that he prepared to support them knowingly. And as his humiliations were
voluntary, he does not want to be opposed to his enemies violent resistance,
and he makes it clear that he was still what he had always been, when in the
hands of his enemies he heals the ear that Peter had cut off and attached to
what the action of the sword had detached; and it is not as a bodily doctor,
but as the Creator of the bodies that he recreates his work that the sword had
disfigured; because doctors can never restore detached limbs from the body.
Therefore, so that the power of God might be reduced to him, and as it had
always been, and also to show the truth of these words that he had said,
"I have the power to give my life, and I have the power to take it
back," (Jn. 10:18) that he commands his disciples to obtain swords, but
without commanding them to use them to kill his enemies. We now have to
consider why the Savior, witness of Peter's action, declares that whoever uses
the sword will perish by the sword (Matt. 26:52), whereas, however, Peter had
not used it unjustly; for, as we read in St. Luke, it was with the permission
of the Lord that he struck Malchus and then heard the defense that was made to
him. (Luke 22:50) The Savior gave him this permission to show that he could
have taken revenge on his enemies, to show that he had the same power which he
had shown, and that he could therefore avenge himself, and in order to convince
his enemies that they seized him by virtue of a power they had received. He did
not appear as vanquished, but as a man who abandons himself to their will. Why
then does he say that whoever uses the sword will perish by the sword? It is
because the judge alone has the right to destroy by the sword; and Peter had
the permission only to strike, but not to take away life by the sword. This is
why Our Lord forbids him to strike again. He also tells him that Christians are
not allowed to kill their fellow men. They are under a law of mercy, and they
are forbidden to use with harshness the right which has been conferred on
society. As for the recommendation that he previously made to them to carry
nothing with them in the road (Matt. 10:10), it is like a sign of peace, of the
grace of miracles, of the sweetness of a doctrine that will be seen in the
Apostles. What did they need to take with them on the road, since they had to
offer everything to them at the sight of the miracles they were operating? But
when the time came when he was to voluntarily give himself up to suffering, and
was on the eve of a passing struggle rather than a war properly so called, he
advised his followers to arm themselves not to resist his enemies, since his
will was to be pleased, but to show, as I have said, that he had foreseen his
passion, that it was subordinated to his power, and that if he consented to
this excess of humiliation was for the salvation of the human race, as we will
say in its place.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">THE PRINCIPLE OR
THE BEGINNING.</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — In the beginning was the Word.
(Jn. 1:1) What is at the beginning? We read in the Old Testament: "In the
beginning God created heaven and earth (Gen. 1:1)." And in the Epistle of
the same Apostle (John), author of this Gospel, of which we try to explain the
exordium, this expression is taken in the same sense. This is how it is
expressed in this Epistle: "What was in the beginning (I Jn. 1:1).” The
Epistle and the Gospel thus present the same thought, the same signification.
On the contrary, there is a discrepancy between these words of the Old
Testament: "In the beginning God created heaven and earth," and those
of the New Testament: "In the beginning was the Word." And again:
"That which was from the beginning." Being in the beginning, and
being from the beginning signifies one and the same thing, for what was from
the beginning did not begin to be. What begins to exist was not from the
beginning, and therefore is subject to a beginning to be first in the order of
creatures, because in fact the one that was made in the beginning was followed
by all those which were made after him. Here is why we read: ‘In the beginning
were heaven and earth’, for while they did not yet extirpate and God had
resolved to create the world; in principle, that is to say, among the elements
which were to serve the creation of the world, God created heaven and earth
first, because the principle is the beginning of a thing which begins to be the
first of those to follow. But when the Evangelist says: "In the beginning
was the Word," he wants to teach us that he existed before all the
creatures of heaven and earth, and that he is not only the first of created
beings, for it was in the beginning when God had resolved to create the world,
and if it were in principle, that is, before all things, it existed from all
eternity, he was the Word, and where was he? "In God," said the
Evangelist, "that there should be no temptation to give him a beginning
worthy of him who was in God from all eternity that the one who was in God before
all things was not subject to any beginning, so the Evangelist adds, "And
the Word was God." He clearly shows that everything he said before applies
perfectly to the Word, for the Word is God, and there can be no other thought
worthy of God than that of his eternalness, if it began to be, it is a
creature, and if it is created it is not God. All that exists is either God or
creature, and by the same name the name of God does not fit the creature. But
as his being has no beginning (for he was), it is rightly that we call him God.
Now, we say that the Word has always been in God, because his being does not
come from himself, but from God. This is why He is called the Word of God, as
the testimony of the same Evangelist teaches in his revelation: "And his
name is the Word of God (Rev. 19:13).” He is called the Word of God, to teach
us that he is not that of whom, but by whom are all things; that is to say, he
is not the Father, but the Son. By the same that God cannot be without his
Word, we must believe that he who is called his Word has always been in God,
and as the Word cannot be apart from the one of whom he is the Word, we must
understand that Word who was in God had no other principle of his being than
God himself, and that being of God he is not opposed to the reason of saying
that he is God. Thus, from the fact that God was in God, it does not follow
that there are two gods. If they were two, they would have a different nature
and will. If we, who have one and the same nature, we do not consent to have
different wills, how much more if God and the Word did not have the same
nature, and if the Word was not God in God? The God who was and who is in God,
does not have the divine being himself, otherwise we would not say that he is
God in God, and the Word of God would not be called the Word God; but since
what is of God can only be God, the Word of God is called God, so that this name
of God's Word prevents us from thinking of another God. Now the Word is given
the name of God, because it would be offensive to God that what is of God
should not be called God. The unity of God has thus safeguarded, and at the
same time the honor rendered to those of the law, for it is not in his own
glory that he who is God from God is but in the glory of him who is the
principle of his divine being. This is why the Gospel begins to speak about the
Word before speaking of God the Father, because what raises difficulties is not
God the Father, but the Word of God. No one raises doubts about God, but about
the one who is God from God, every language on earth as in the underworld
confesses the existence of one God, but he is troubled by the mystery of one
God. He is astonished to hear that the Word of God is God, for he is besieged
by the corporal images that tell him that the name of man cannot be given to
the Word of Man. A simple nature is not a compound of different members, there
is not in and out of it, the front and the back, the high and the low, no
variety, no dissemblance, it is a splendor which is one and immense, if the
fire itself has neither front, nor behind nor inside, nor outside, how much
less its Creator. Since therefore all that is God is a unique whole, there is
no contradiction in calling God all that is God. So a reason borrowed in part
from that occurs among men, and partly to a higher order of things, makes us
understand that the Son of God who is the Word of God, is God; just as the
children of men are men, so the Son of God is God. But the children of men are
men because of the union of the two sexes, and it is not so that the Son of God
is God, because he is not simply of a God who is a simple nature. Our word,
which is from us, helps us to understand that the Word of God is from him, but
our word is not what we are, and it is not in this way that the Word of God is
God, because the Word of God is a real thing and not a sound that goes out.
From the fact that we use the same expressions for God and for us, it does not
follow that the reason for being is the same for us and for him in reality. Thus
we read, "In the beginning God made heaven and earth.” (Gen. 1:1) How did
they do it? Is it with the hand, as when we do some action? Further down we
read again: "And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.” To
whom do we hear that God has spoken here? This is certainly not a man, but one
who had the power to create, and who was to create the man himself as he
created it indeed. But how did he speak? Is it beginning with a material organ?
Far from us this thought. You see, then, that if we use the same expressions
for God and for us, these expressions indicate a very different way of acting,
for God acts quite differently from us, and his language has nothing to do with
ours. Thus the Word of God is not a Word like ours, which scarcely formed
ceases to exist; it is a Word that remains, because it is a Word that hears,
speaks, acts. He is not only the Word of God, he is the power, the wisdom of
God, he is the Son of God. As to the effect produced, he is the Son of God; if
we consider the manner in which God speaks to us through him, he is called the
Word of God; if we look at the wisdom by which God teaches us through his
mysteries, he is the wisdom of God; if finally we contemplate this omnipotent
operation by virtue of which God has made and continues to do all things, it is
called the power of God. None of these titles can be acceptable to the Son of
God. By the same thing that he is God from God, we attribute to him all the
perfections of the divine nature. These divine attributes are a necessary
continuation of his birth. It would not have been fitting for the Word of God,
the wisdom, the power of God, to be anything inferior to God, for that is the
God the Word, the power and wisdom of God. It is because Christ is the whole
God from God himself, that he is called wisdom, power, the Word of God, because
that is how he is God from God and God abiding in God. That's why the
Evangelist says, "He was in God from the beginning." (Jn. 1:2) The
Scripture is forced to make this statement to convince the spirits of
unbelievers; it wants to show that Christ is God; as everywhere to consecrate
the unity of God, it wants us to understand that Christ is God. Here Scripture
openly proclaims that he is God and that he has always been good, that is to
say, that he reveals to us the mystery that is in God, to teach us that he is
not alone. Scripture therefore declares that if God is one, he is not however
alone, but that even if there are two or three persons in him, they come out of
the same nature and do not detract in any way from unity, because what comes
from a single principle relates to it, because this principle is a good that
all things come from God. But there is a great difference between what derives
its being from God in a proper sense, and what he has created out of his will,
that is to say, there is an immense distance between what is out of its
substance, and what does not exist has been drawn from nothingness by its will.
What came out of the substance of God did not exist after this substance; on
the contrary, what was created began to be a substance only at the moment of
its creation. There is only the Trinity alone, which has no beginning. The
manifestation of this mystery has diminished the merit of faith, for the more
the object of faith is hidden, the greater is the reward of him who believes,
and for the same reason the greater the punishment of the unbeliever. Just as
the manifestation of the mystery diminishes the merit of believers, it
increases the punishment reserved for those who refuse to believe. The more a
law is clear, the more one is guilty of transgressing it. No doubt it was
enough of the testimony of the Savior who declared that he had God for his
Father. Who among the faithful could have the slightest doubt that the nature
of the Son was in any way different from that of the Father? But the perversity
of heretics having sought to undermine the rights of faith by their impious and
untrue fictions, hearing the Son of God in a different sense from what the
Christian faith taught, the Evangelist thought it necessary to add for more
great clarity that he had been before all things in God and God himself. This
is how he explained what the notion of the true Son contains. Divine goodness
seems to have had regard to human weakness by manifesting what had previously
remained hidden, and which it reserved as a reward for a more perfect faith.
St. John adds: "All things were done by him.” (Jn. 1:3) If the foregoing
could leave some doubt in the human mind too narrow to understand the divine
things, it grows, it seems, hearing these words: “All things were made by him.”
He cannot regard him as a creature, since he is told that God has done all
things through him. Now, if he were himself a creature, the Evangelist would
not say that God did all things, for it was not done by himself. To put this
truth into a greater way, he adds; "And nothing was done without
him," words that put an end to any discussion and exclude all human
reasoning. There are some who may have doubts, yet the Evangelist, declaring
that nothing has been done without him, does not even allow him to suspect that
he himself is a creature. How to say that he is a creature made and designed
from nothing, when you are taught that God did nothing without him? Do you say
that Scripture says that God did nothing without him? Far from us this thought.
Scripture is the very truth, and to cut error into its root, it spreads the
brightest light to redeem men and save them. St. John adds, "What has been
done is life in him," that is, what has been done is life in the Word.
This is what the Lord himself teaches us: Just as the Father has life in him,
so he gave the Son to have life in him. (Jn. 5:26) It is not that the Word was
ever lifeless, and that it was given to him or made in him, the Evangelist
wants us to understand that the Word was itself life. If one can say of the
Father that he is something else or that he has something else in him, one can
say it also of the Son, for just as the Father has life in him, he has given to
the Son to have life in him. Human language is powerless to properly express
divine things. Thus it seems improper to say that the Son of God having not
been made, we say that what has been done in him. If the Evangelist had said: What
was engendered in him, the property of the terms would leave something to be
desired. But to express his substantial generation, he used the terms he could
find to make known the work of this generation that gave it to be, because this
generation has life in it. For us, we have life, it is true, but we cannot
communicate it to others, because this very life is not in our power. But for
the Word, the Evangelist says that he has life in him, because he has the power
to give life, and to draw from the void the creatures he wants to give them
existence and life. The end of his divine birth is that he can do all the
things the Father does, because he has life in him like the Father. In fact, to
have done all things through him and in him, is to have begotten him to have in
him the life by which he could do all things. It is not that he is himself
anything but life, but since the essence of his life is to live, and to be able
to communicate this life to the beings that he draws from nothingness, they say
he has life in himself. We live, I repeat, but we do not have in us the life
itself to be able to communicate it to others. It is this truth which the
Apostle St. Paul recalls in these terms: "Who is the image of the
invisible God, the firstborn of all creatures? It is through him that
everything was created in heaven and on earth, things visible as invisible,
thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, everything was created by him and
in him. (Col. 1:15) The two testimonies of the Apostles St. John and St. Paul are
perfectly in agreement, they teach the same truth, that is, the Son of God was
begotten before all creatures, for to create the spiritual powers, the world
and all the visible beings that it contains. St. John says: "What was done
is life in him," (Jn. 1:3) and St. Paul expresses the same truth in these
words: "It is through him that everything was created in heaven and on the
earth.” (Col. 1:16) And further: “Everything was created by him and in him.”
God created through him, because he is the same God by nature, that is, the
Father is in the Son. "Everything was created in him," because he
begot the Son to have the power to create all things visible and invisible.
This is how he made life in him, so that he might exist and give to all other animated
beings life, intelligence, action, according to his will as the image of God.
He is called the image of God for these two reasons, first, because by virtue
of his birth he reproduces in himself the perfect likeness of the Father, and
secondly because his power is equal to that of the Father, so that it is true
to say that we see the Father in the Son who is the image of the invisible God.
From what he declares the invisible Father, does it follow that the Son is
visible? No, since the Son is by nature what the Father is. Since the celestial
creature is invisible, let alone the one who created it. The Evangelist
therefore wishes to speak here of what is being accomplished not on earth, but
in heaven, for although the Son is invisible, yet he manifests himself in
heaven and to the saints of whom he has said himself: "My Father, I want
them wherever I am, to be with me, and to contemplate my glory." (Jn.
17:24) And elsewhere: "Blessed are those who have a pure heart, because
they will see God," (Matt. 5:8), that is, the Father in the Son, God in
his image, that is, God in God. The image of a corporeal object is itself
bodily; thus God is the image of God, because the Father is the model, and the
Son the reproduction of the copy, which he communicates to the Holy Spirit,
"because he will receive from me," (Jn. 16:14), he says to his
Apostles, just as no one has been found worthy to open the book and lift the
seals, except the Word of God (Rev. 5:4), so no one is worthy to see God the
Father either by his nature or by his merits, except the true Son of God. There
is no intermediary between the Father and the Son, it is Himself who declares
it to us: "No one has ever seen the Father, except he who is of God, he
has seen the Father." (Jn. 6:46) But if we see the Father in the Son, why
is no one worthy to see God, since we see him in the Son who is no different
from the Father? There is no difference in nature, we agree, because he is the
real Son of God, but it differs in the relation of causality, because all power
comes to the Son from the Father. The Son does not have a nature inferior to
the Father, but the Father has greater authority in the testimony of the Lord
himself: "If you love me," he said to his disciples, "If you
love me," he said to his disciples, "you will rejoice at my going to
my Father, because my Father is greater than me." (Jn. 14:28) Saint Paul
observes the same nuance in his language when he says: "There is for us
but one God, the Father from whom all things proceed and who has made us for
him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom all things were made, and we exist
through him." (1 Cor. 8:6) In the first degree is that of whom are all
things, by whom all things exist, and since there is no inferiority in the
divine persons, the Apostle brings them all back to the unity of God when he
says, "It is of him, and through him, and in him are all things, to him be
glory in all ages." (Rom. 11:36)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  what these words mean: "The law was given by Moses.” The law given by
  Moses has clear precepts; but he has also written a story to which we have

  true. Would it be these commandments: "You will not kill, you will not
  commit adultery, you will not steal?” (Exod. 20:13) The others are alike. As
  for the historical part, it is evident that it was not true before the advent
  of Jesus Christ; for one could not know the true meaning of those things
  which were covered like a veil. But when Jesus Christ came to make known to
  whom God speaks, saying, "Let us make man in our image and
  likeness," (Gen. 1:26) who created him, whoever created him, appeared to
  the patriarchs in a bush (Exod. 3:2), the one who made the stone fertile
  (Exod. 17:6) and poured out streams in the desert, for the stone, says the
  Apostle, was Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 10:4); it can be said that the truth shone
  most brightly by Jesus Christ when he revealed the true meaning of things
  that had hitherto remained hidden or doubtful. Is it not he who says to us,
  "Is it from me that Moses wrote?” (Jn. 5:46) This is what before him was
  hidden and was wrong. The Son was considered to be God the Father, and it was
  recognized that it was the Son of God himself who appeared in the form of an
  angel. The promise that God made to Abraham remained doubtful until it was
  fulfilled; but when the coming of Jesus Christ came to fulfill the law, it
  became a truth, for it had all its faith and it was clear what its object
  was. Indeed one recognizes the truth of the one who makes a promise when he
  puts it into execution. Let us examine what these words mean: "The law
  was given by Moses.” The law given by Moses has clear precepts, which of
  these precepts is not an exact truth? “You will not kill, you will not commit
  adultery”; The others are similar. But Moses also wrote in which, until the
  advent of the Savior, the truth remained covered like a veil. When Jesus
  Christ came to make known to whom God was speaking, saying, "Let us make
  man”, who is the one who created the man, who showed himself in the bush or
  the patriarchs, who poured torrents of water from the rock; for "the
  stone was Christ," says St. Paul; the truth was made by Jesus Christ,
  who made known to us the true meaning of things that remained uncertain to
  us. The law given by Moses thus convinced sinners to be guilty; the grace
  promised by the law has given them their sins and delivered them from death.
  The order that God wished to follow was to first give the law, and then
  mercy, which becomes grace when it remits sins; for the promise changes into
  grace by its fulfillment. "There will come," says Isaiah, "a
  redeemer for Zion, who will deliver Jacob from his ungodliness.” (Isa. 59:20
  LXX) This promise became grace through Jesus Christ, who remits sin free of
  charge. Now, how would he forgive sins if he did not first give the law
  which, rendering men guilty, gives him an opportunity to forgive their sins?
  Because he could only put back what was due to him. However, this debt could
  not exist if the law had not preceded.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  59.</font></span></b></span></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> IF BAPTISM IS A HEAVENLY
  MYSTERY, WHY DOES OUR LORD SAY TO NICODEMUS, WHO DOUBTED THE VIRTUE OF THE
  BAPTISM OF WHICH HE SPOKE TO HIM: IF I HAVE TOLD YOU EARTHLY THINGS AND YOU
  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM, HOW SHALL I BELIEVE? WHAT IF I TELL YOU HEAVENLY THINGS?
  </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— He who
  makes the efficacy of baptism depend on this material sign is not a spiritual
  man, and the heavenly gift can be obtained only on the condition that it is
  believed by faith, not by water only that our souls are renewed. Water
  strikes the eyes of the body, but the Holy Spirit, whom we do not see,
  operates in the soul and inspires faith in it. As the water cleanses the
  defilements of the body, the Holy Spirit purifies the soul of his sins; the
  material element produces a material effect, the Holy Spirit produces all
  things spiritual, and these are the effects which are chiefly to be
  considered in baptism. What we hear there is a virtue superior to what we
  see. Now, as Nicodemus was under the influence of all material ideas, the
  Savior has recourse to a very just comparison to attract him to the faith,
  and to confirm the truth of an invisible thing, he gives him the example of a
  visible fact, which is perceived only by hearing and not by sight, though it
  is not disputed, and yet it is an earthly fact because it is one of the
  phenomena of this world. Our Lord therefore tells Nicodemus to persuade him:
  "The wind blows where it wills, you hear its voice, but you do not know
  where it comes from or where it is going, so is every man who is born of the
  Spirit "(Jn. 3:8), that is, as you hear, but without perceiving, as has
  been said, the voice of the blowing wind, words that express the effects of
  baptism, but we do not see how the Holy Spirit produces these effects: we
  hear the words that announce what will be done by the one who pronounces
  them, and whose purpose is to inspire faith, but not to give reason for the
  action itself, and as this comparison was not yet sufficient to bring
  Nicodemus to faith, the Savior said to him: "If you do not believe when
  I speak to you of the things of the earth, how will you believe when will I
  speak to you about things that are in heaven? These earthly things he has
  said is the comparison he has just made; that is to say, if the earthly
  comparison of the blowing wind cannot lead you to believe this fact, because
  you do not see how it occurs, how could you believe if I brought you
  celestial reasons that you do not know? One can persuade a man what he does
  not know by means of what he knows; so when God says of Jesus Christ that he is
  his true son, or cannot understand as it is done; but as we know the manner
  of birth of children according to the flesh, we believe that by saying Christ
  is my true Son, God meant that he had begotten him of his own substance. This
  is how he wants us to understand in the Savior what the word and the spirit
  of man cannot explain by what is sensible and can be understood, that is to
  say that he wanted to render credible the action of the Holy Spirit, which
  cannot be understood by the example of the will, which the senses perceive
  and the ear hears. So again, we read in the Acts of the Apostles:
  "Suddenly a noise came from heaven, like a violent wind coming near, and
  filled the whole house where they sat, and so on. (Acts 2:2) The sacred
  author shows us that the Holy Spirit came from heaven as the wind, and with a
  noise like that of a violent wind blowing on the earth. Jeremiah also
  compares the Spirit to the wind in these words: "The wind is blowing in
  all countries.” Now, just as he is in this world and circulates everywhere,
  we do not know where he comes from or where he is going. The Holy Spirit, on
  the contrary, descends from heaven, as we have read, to enlighten all who
  believe in him. How then to explain what the Savior said about the Holy
  Spirit. "The wind blows where he wills, and you hear his voice, but you
  do not know where he comes from, or where he is going," since he wanted
  to rely on a comparison here? He adds, "This is so with every man born
  of the Spirit.” (Jn. 3:8) Is it not evident that he wanted to compare the
  Spirit with the wind? But they think that it is not wind that is in question,
  because he says: "It blows where He wills," as if every creature,
  though subject to the laws that govern it, was not left to his freedom. We
  ourselves go and do what we want, while being subject to a law, which is why
  we will report on our actions. It may still be admitted, and this opinion is
  not contrary to reason, that to express the effect produced by the Holy
  Spirit, he chose it himself as an example. The question seems to me to be
  solved in all its aspects. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  THE SAVIOR SAYS THAT JOHN'S BAPTISM CAME FROM HEAVEN, SO WHY DO YOU SAY
  NICODEMUS'S BAPTISM TO HIM?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
  — If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe them, and so on. These
  words of the Lord: "If I have told you earthly things and you do not
  believe them,” do not relate to baptism, for we know that our baptism, though
  having water for matter, is all spiritual; but there is a celestial mystery
  here. It is not water that purifies, but God, who acts in an invisible and
  incomprehensible manner. He wants to give an example of this truth by saying:
  "The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its voice, but you do not
  know where it comes from or where it is going.” By this comparison, he wished
  to lead Nicodemus into believing that man received a new birth from the water
  and the Holy Spirit, without being able to understand how it was done. is a
  very spiritual operation. This is how you hear the voice of the spirit, that
  is, the wind, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going;
  so you do not know how the change takes place in the one who receives a new
  birth, however you realize that it is done, because this change is sensible
  for you. In fact, if the wind blows where it wants, how much more can the
  Spirit, who is of God, sanctify all those he wants? Our Lord says: "He
  breathes where He wills," because every creature, though subject to
  laws, is, however, left to His freedom, and if anyone claims that this spirit
  which is blowing is the Holy Spirit, he is in error, since the Savior takes
  this spirit as a term of comparison to persuade Nicodemus of the regeneration
  of man by water and the Spirit, a regeneration which he could not bring
  himself to believe. The object which it serves to demonstrate if,
  ​​therefore, our Lord makes use of comparison here, this sensible spirit,
  which is called the wind, is not the Holy Spirit, He wished to persuade
  Nicodemus of a spiritual reason, and triumph over his doubts, he brings him
  the example of the wind to make it easier for him to believe the existence
  and action of the Holy Spirit, but we know that the Holy Spirit came from
  heaven to spread in the world the soul of believers, as we see he came upon
  the Apostles in the beginning of the Church, and the voice of the Holy Spirit
  is compared to a big noise. "And suddenly a noise came from heaven like
  a violent wind." (Acts. 2:2) In what follows, the sacred writer calls
  this sound a voice the works of the Holy Spirit to confirm the word of the
  Savior. Is this not what these words mean: "And suddenly a noise came
  from heaven like a violent wind." He wants us to understand that the
  Holy Spirit came down with a noise like a violent wind, so he took the wind
  for the sake of comparison, adding, "This is so with every man born of
  the spirit." We do not know where the wind comes from, but the Holy
  Spirit descends from heaven.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

SINCE THERE IS ONLY ONE. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
It is from God the Father that the Evangelist wants to speak when he says that
no one has seen God, except the only Son who is in the bosom of the Father and
who has made it known to us. (Jn. 1:18) Let us then mark to the Son, He taught
us that no one except He saw God. Now, he speaks in this way to teach us that
it is he who has constantly appeared to the patriarchs and the prophets. These
words, therefore, do not apply to the only God, but to the Person of the Father
whom we cannot call otherwise than God the Father. As for the Son, he declares
that he has been seen, but in an invisible way for those who thought he saw
him. The vision here is the intellect, because it is not in the eyes of the
body but in the eyes of the intellect that he was manifested, and to have seen him,
it is to have understood that God revealed himself in this appearance. Now,
when the Savior says, "He who sees me, see also my Father," (Jn.
14:9) he wants to speak not of the vision of the eyes, but of the mind, and to
make us understand that there is no difference between the Father and the Son. Neither
were seen in their nature. In apparitions, the Son has been seen only by the intellect
and not by the eyes of the body, because he is invisible as the Father.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  WE ARE THE MASTERS OF OUR WILL, WHY DOES THE SAVIOR SAY, "NO ONE COMES
  TO ME UNLESS MY FATHER, WHO SENT ME, DRAWS HIM?” THE APOSTLE EXPRESSES
  HIMSELF IN SIMILAR TERMS: "IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO WANT OR TO RUN, GOD MUST
  HAVE MERCY”; AND AGAIN: “HE HAS MERCY ON WHOM HE PLEASES, AND HE LETS HIM
  HARDEN WHOM HE PLEASES.” HOW DOES THE WILL REMAIN FREE IF IT IS TRAINED FOR
  GOOD OR EVIL, ACCORDING TO A FOREIGN WILL?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — Things are quite different
  from what you claim, and the meaning of these words is by no means the one
  you give them. Free will has nothing to fear here, and if you want to deepen
  the meaning of these words, you will see that they are still one of the
  strongest supports of free will. Jesus speaks here to the Jews, whose hostile
  dispositions he knew. By a shameful dissimulation which arose from a feeling
  of envy, they affirmed that Joseph was his father, and his children were the
  brothers of the Savior, in order not to believe that he was the Son of God.
  It was then that he said to them, "No one can come to me unless my
  Father, who sent me, draws him." Now, how did the Father draw on the
  Son, if not by the works he was doing by the Son? This is what the Son
  himself says: "The Father who dwells in me does the works that I
  do," (Jn. 14:10) so that these works would attract. The miracles of the
  Savior were proof that God was his Father, so that he who maintained that he
  had another father was not attracted to God the Father. God did these works
  by Jesus Christ so that men could believe in the words by which He affirmed
  that He was the Son of God. This is not a violent attraction, it is the
  testimony that God gives back to Jesus Christ, and he who believes in this
  testimony, the Father draws him to Jesus Christ, for no one can believe in
  the Savior except the one who knows that he has God for his Father. It is not
  to undermine free will that the Apostle has expressed the truth of which you
  are asking a question here, but it is to defend the man from putting into
  discussion the judgments from God that he proclaims his righteousness here,
  for God knows to whom he must have mercy. He scrutinizes the depths of hearts
  and sees whether the inner dispositions of the one who prays make him worthy
  to receive the effect of his prayer. In fact, God tells us through his
  prophet, "This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are
  far from me.” (Isa. 19:13) It is therefore his justice to harden the soul of
  the hypocrite; for he who gives to the truth the name of falsehood not by
  error, but by a guilty intention, and who, while understanding what is good,
  pretends to ignore what good is to transform it into evil, deserves to be
  condemned to lose with the intelligence of the good his rights to salvation,
  to which he renounces. It is not right, in fact, to save in spite of himself
  a man who scorns salvation not out of ignorance, but out of mischief and
  envy. These words confirm free will rather than destroy it, since each is
  treated here according to his will.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  be compromised by these words. If you apply them to the truth on which they
  were said, you will see that they serve rather as the defense of free will.
  Indeed, the Jews, by a malicious inspiration, said of the Savior: "Is
  not he the son of Joseph? Do not we know his father? How can he say: I came
  down from heaven?” (Jn. 6:42) Then Jesus answered them, "No one can come
  to me unless my Father who sent me draws him.” Let us now see how the Father
  draws to his Son. Let us take these words of the Savior Himself: "The
  works that I do is my Father who does them. Believe that I am in my Father
  and my Father in me.” (Jn. 14:10) If, then, the Father works in the Son and
  the works he makes invite to faith, Our Lord is right to say; "No one
  comes to me unless my Father draws him.” The Father draws when he acts
  through the Son. How can one who asks for faith in him destroy the will of
  free will? How can one who convinces a man of unbelief draw him in spite of
  himself? It is to the Jews who gave him another father than his true Father
  that he keeps this language. No one, in fact, can believe in the Savior
  except by recognizing that God is his Father. If the Apostle, on his side,
  expresses himself in this way, it is not to undermine free will, but to show
  the justice of the judgments of God, which cannot be deceived when he gives
  or refuse his mercy. One implores mercy and does not deserve to receive it,
  the other demands it, and he is worthy of obtaining it. He asks for it not
  only by his words but by his works; this only implores him with the end of
  his lips, while the other joins with his words a contrite heart and thus
  assures the effect of his prayer. What does God say, indeed, in the law? “This
  people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." (Isa.
  19:13) If, then, two men pray the same prayer and only one is granted, we
  must be convinced that prayer has made him worthy to receive what he asked,
  for God is just and gives his graces only wisely. You see, then, that free
  will, far from being destroyed, is confirmed. If you were told that two men
  addressed to God the same prayer, in the same spirit, and with the same
  works, and that one of them was granted, and the other rejected, you would
  have the right to say that there is no longer free will and that God is a
  respecter of persons.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

present your questions in an abbreviated form that hides their meaning. The
fact of which you speak here took place when Jesus was in Galilee, because of
the agitation of the Jews against him; his parents, who did not yet believe in
him, urged him, as he approached a feast of the Jews, to go to Judea to expose
him after a sedition. The Savior answered them, "Go to this feast, because
the world does not hate you; but he hates me because I condemn their works. I'm
not going to this festivity because my time has not come yet. His brethren then
went to this feast, and Jesus remained in Galilee.” Where is the contradiction
here? He does not go to this festivity when he declares that he is not going,
he does not go there until later, and he does not go for the festivity itself,
but as if he were going to a discussion, to a judgment. All the others had gone
to this festivity to enjoy the pleasure it promised them. For the Savior, his
feast day was when he redeemed the world with his passion. It is then that he
says, "Now the son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.” (Jn.
13:31) His feast day is when he triumphed over death.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  a different object, which is characterized in a summary but precise manner.
  There is one and the same Spirit, but his gifts are multiplied. When,
  therefore, they speak to you of the Holy Spirit, they must not be separated
  from their office in which they are as personified. That he was with the
  apostles and that he had to come, is an indisputable truth, but in hearing it
  from the person and not from nature. Jesus Christ promised, in fact, to send
  from his Father another comforter, but in the sense that their divine nature
  being the same, the presence of Jesus Christ does not carry away the absence
  of the Holy Spirit, just as the coming and manifestation of the Holy Spirit
  does not exclude the presence of Jesus Christ. So when he promises his
  disciples the coming of the Holy Spirit, he says to them, "You will see
  him, because he will remain with you and he will be in you. (Jn. 14:17) He gives
  them the assurance that after the ascension of the Lord they will have a
  pastor to protect them and a king whose power is neither inferior nor less
  excellent. For it is certain that the Holy Spirit was given only to those who
  believed that in the time marked by the Evangelist, when the Lord had
  triumphed over death and was gloriously resurrected from the grave. This is
  what the Savior expressly says to his disciples after his triumphant
  resurrection: “and John baptized you in water, but you will be baptized in
  the Holy Spirit that you will receive in a few days.” He spoke to them thus
  in the time when he was preparing to go up to his Father. When the Lord, a
  few days after his resurrection, breathes on his apostles and says to them,
  "Receive the Holy Spirit," (Jn. 20:22) He communicates to them the
  ecclesiastical power. As in the exercise of the powers conferred by the Lord,
  everything is done by the Holy Spirit, when he gives them the rule and the
  form of this divine institution, he says to them: "Receive the Holy
  Spirit.” And to show that it is in fact the power conferred on the Church, he
  adds: "He whose sins you have retained will be withheld from him, and to
  whom you have forgiven them, they will be forgiven.” This insufflation is
  therefore a grace which is communicated by tradition to those who are
  ordained, and which impresses them with a more impressive and more sacred
  character, which is why the Apostle says to Timothy: "Do not neglect the
  grace which is in you, and given to you with the laying on of the hands of
  the priests." (1 Tim. 4:14) This is what the Savior had to do once, so
  that it was well established in the Church that the transmission of this
  power could not take place without the Holy Spirit. Just as the Savior wanted
  to give in his person a visible example that the Holy Spirit was given after
  baptism to all who believed in him; so he wanted to give us here a definite
  proof that the transmission of ecclesiastical power was inseparable from the
  infusion of the Holy Spirit. The apostles, like the prophets, have the power
  to perform miracles in the very presence of the Lord. We therefore see in the
  person of the apostles three different forms of ministry conferred upon them
  by the Holy Spirit. The first is ecclesiastical power to regenerate the
  faithful and to fulfill the other duties of the sacred ministry. The second,
  which was given at Pentecost, is general, for it is not only on the apostles,
  but on all the faithful, that the Holy Spirit descended. The third was given
  to the apostles alone, to perform miracles and wonders until the seeds of
  faith which they shed in hearts were sufficiently developed. These seeds of
  faith were the wonders performed by the apostles. God established them as the
  pontiffs of truth, to testify by the miracles and wonders they performed that
  our faith was according to reason. Indeed, what stronger proof of the truth
  than a miracle? This is what falsifies all the philosophical systems of the
  earth, is that they are but a tissue of vain words, without the support of
  the testimony of the miracle which would testify the immutable truth of their
  doctrine. The Holy Spirit is therefore generally given to all the faithful,
  in whose soul it remains as a proof that they are the sons of God. On the
  contrary, are they miracles and wonders to be done? The Holy Spirit does not
  abide in man; he comes into him when he is called, he inspires what is
  necessary, and withdraws. It is the same in the transmission of sacred powers
  or in ordination; grace is external, and interior help is given only to souls
  full of faith.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  is certain that the Holy Spirit was given to the faithful only after the
  Lord's victory over death and his glorious resurrection. Before his
  ascension, the Savior gave his Apostles the form in which the faithful should
  receive the Holy Spirit after their baptism, a form still faithfully observed
  by the bishops. We therefore see in the person of the apostles three
  different forms of ministry which are conferred by the Holy Spirit. The first
  form is general; it was given on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit
  descended not only upon the apostles, but upon all the faithful, who then

  only to the apostles, to perform the miracles and wonders necessary for the
  growth of faith, for the seeds of faith are the wonders wrought by the
  apostles. The Holy Spirit was therefore given to the apostles according to
  the order of these different ministries. He descended first on them as on the
  other faithful on the day of Pentecost. They then received him as first
  priests and to give as bishops the Holy Spirit to the faithful by laying
  hands on them. The gift of miracles received by the apostles was a special
  grace to time rather than to people; they received this gift because it was
  the time when the Lord spread His graces on the earth, and the power to work
  miracles by the Holy Spirit was communicated to them for the edification of
  the faithful. So they received, at the time Our Lord sent them, the power to
  cast out demons and to perform other wonders, to command demons or various
  diseases without invoking his name, and to see their commandment followed by
  the healing. They acted under the same power that the prophets Elijah and
  Elisha had received to perform their wonders. Now the Savior said to his
  disciples, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything from my
  Father in my name, he will give it to you. Ask, and you will receive." (Jn.
  16:23) So if the apostles did their miracles without invoking the name of the
  Savior, it is not, however, under the power of that divine name; for by the
  same that they were sent by him who was the terror of demons and sufferings,
  the mere fear of his name put the demons to flight, and healed the
  infirmities. So it was the name of the Lord who secretly operated all these
  wonders. In fact, listen to what the Apostle St. Peter said to the Jews:
  "It is in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that you have denied and
  crucified that this man is here before you, standing and healthy, for no
  other name under heaven has been given to men by which we shall be saved.
  "(Acts 4:16).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the holy Gospel in these words of Our Lord to the Jews: "You are of your
father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a
murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because
there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature,
for he is a liar and the father of lies.” </font><a name="_Hlk516460598"><font color="#000000" size="3">(John 8:44) </font></a><font size="3">None
of the faithful must doubt that the devil was the only author of his apostasy.
He is the principle and the leader of all error, seeing that God had given him
an extraordinary power by creating an extraordinary power, dared to carry his
ambitious plans even to the Divinity, in order to place himself as God above
those whom he had saw below him. Now the names of devil and Satan given to him come
from his works and not from his nature. Every evil is recognized by works, and
it is not nature that is guilty of it, but the will which is determined by
certain motives. He saw that he was superior to others, and pride made him
aspire to domination. But why does the Scriptures seem to give a father to the
one who was the author of his crime? or how to prove that he was homicide from
the beginning? (1) Here the Scripture gives its name to the one who has been
his imitator; for as his works have earned him the name of devil, every man
guilty of a bad action deserves that name. It is therefore Cain whom the Savior
here calls the devil, because he has made himself his imitator by becoming
envious of his brother, by putting him to death, and leaving such an awful
example of fratricidal cruelty. The devil, envious of the man whom God had
created in his image, put the height of his wickedness by giving the example of
error and falsehood. Cain follows this path of lying when God asks him,
"Where is your brother Abel?” (Gen. 4:9) Full of his father's mischief, he
does not hesitate to immediately make this lying answer: "I do not know.”
He pretends to not know where he is of whom he had just taken the life of;
cruelty blinded him to make him answer to God as to a man to whom he hoped to
hide his crime. Now the Jews became his imitators, and put to death the Lord
himself; they preferred to have Cain's fratricide father as God, thus rendering
themselves guilty of all the blood that had been shed. In putting to death the
source of life, they became the perpetrators of the crime in all its extent,
and made the responsibility fall upon their children, when they shouted,
"May his blood be upon us and our children.” (Matt. 27:25) To persuade
Pilate that they did not ask him for anything wrong, they consented that this
action, if it was unfair, would fall upon their children; With this burning
desire to satisfy their fury, they do not even think of sparing their children.
Now, a proof that the devil is not evil of his nature, is that God would not
threaten punishment who did not do what he did not know, for it would be wrong
to punish the one who acts in accordance with the requirements of its nature.
And this injustice is greater still, if you ask a man what you know him to be
impossible. On the contrary, justice demands that one punish who knows and can
do good, does not fail to do evil. This is what can be concluded from the words
of the Savior, for he says to the Jews, as we have said above, "Your
father was murderous from the beginning, and he did not remain in the truth.” Now,
if he was a liar by his nature, why say he did not remain in the truth? Not to
dwell in truth is not to persevere in truth. Finally, we read in the Prophet
these words of the Lord: "Had they remained in my substance," (Jer.
23:22) to say in my law. The Apostle also said to the Galatians, "Stay
firm, and do not put yourself under the yoke of bondage.” (Gal 5:1) What is
clearer? St. Paul recommends that the faithful continue to persevere in the
commandments of God. If the demon had observed them, he would have remained in
the substance and in the law of God, for the law is an unshakable foundation
for those who observe it. How, then, have some of them been able to say that
God created the devil to be evil, or that he had an origin of his own, that is
to say, that he owed it to no one else, double supposition also offensive to
God? He who maintains that God created the devil to be evil, attributes to him
a very imperfect kindness, for a perfectly good being cannot do evil. As for
the one who does not believe that the devil draws from God his origin, he
denies the sovereign domain of God, because he believes he can remove from this
domain that extends to everything a thing that would be independent. Those who
make such mistakes will be severely punished when they see that God will judge
all things through Jesus Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

DOES OUR LORD SAY TO THE JEWS, "THE FATHER OF WHOM YOU ARE BORN IS THE
DEVIL, AND YOU WANT TO FULFILL THE DESIRES OF YOUR FATHER. HE WAS MURDERER FROM
THE BEGINNING, AND HE DID NOT REMAIN IN THE TRUTH, FOR THE TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.
WHEN HE UTTERS A LIE, HE SAYS IT IS HIS OWN, FOR HE IS A LIAR LIKE HIS FATHER*.”
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The devil's
name is not a particular name, but a common name. No matter where we find the
works of the devil we are allowed to give him that name. This is the name that
suits his works rather than his nature. This father of the Jews whom Our Lord
wants to speak in this place is Cain, whom they wanted to be the imitators by
putting the Savior to death. This is why he declares that he has not remained
in the truth, because he is defiled by a murderer and has made himself worthy
of death; it was he who gave men the first example of fratricide. Our Lord says
that when he utters lies, he says what is proper to him to make sure that no
one sin only by his own will, but as he himself was a devil's imitator, he
adds, "Because he is a liar like his father.” This spirit of falsehood
pretended, in fact, to ignore the commandment which God had given to the first
man, to condemn him to death. This is how Cain, when God questions him,
pretends to ignore where his brother Abel was, whom he had put to death. The
devil here in the Savior's thought is therefore Cain, and his father is the
devil whose works he imitated. The son of the devil is himself a devil. But the
devil who is called Satan has no father, author of his wickedness. He is
himself the author of his own malice. He was the first to set an example of
sin, and all who imitate him will be called his children, as he is called their
father. This is how our father is Abraham, because he has the first faith in
God, and as such we are his children, because we bear the name of faithful, as
he has deserved himself. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE DOOR," THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE ME ARE ROBBERS AND THIEVES, WORDS THAT
SEEM TO ATTACK THE AUTHORITY OF THE PROPHETS?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — As no one can go to God the
Father except through faith in Jesus Christ, the Savior declares that He is the
door of the kingdom of heaven. But in comparing himself to the door, what need
was it to say of those who had preceded him: "All those who came before
me, etc.," since there was no question of the past, but that was it to
establish that he was now the door? The Savior therefore has in view the Jews
who claimed to enter the kingdom of heaven not by faith, but by the justice of
the law. They came before the Savior, that is to say, they stood before him to
distort and contradict his words, and thus to distract others from believing in
him. That's why he calls them robbers and thieves. In fact, he held this
language to them, while the Pharisees were arguing with the blind man whom he
had healed by giving him the use of the eyes, that nature had refused him, and
that they were diverting him from the faith of the Savior, telling him that one
could not enter into the kingdom of heaven through one who violated the
Sabbath, but through the justice of the law. It is then that Jesus says to
them: "I am the door, if someone enters by me, he will find pasture, but
if someone wants to enter elsewhere, he is a robber and a thief.” Now, how can
these words be applied to the prophets? Did the prophets teach against the
doctrine of Jesus Christ, that they could make themselves acceptable to God
without the faith and the only righteousness of the law, they who were charged
to announce the enthralling of the Son of God? The Savior therefore wanted to
speak of those who lived in his time, and to make us understand that all who
were before him, sitting or standing, were robbers and thieves. By calling in particular
the one who had been blind, they wanted to prevent him from believing in the
Savior. "Give glory to God," said they to him, "we know that
this man is a sinner," a charge which he destroys by replying to them:
"We have never heard that no one opened the eyes of a blind man.” If he
was not of God, he could do nothing. It is therefore of this man who persevered
in faith, and of those who said: These words are not the words of a man who is
possessed of the devil whom the Savior wishes to speak when he says, "But
the sheep have not listened to them,” that is to say, those whom he calls robbers
and thieves. For how could it be admitted that the sheep did not listen to the
prophets, while we know without doubt that the good have always been compliant

97. </font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">WHAT REASONABLE ANSWER CAN ONE MAKE
FROM THE LAW TO THE IMPIETY OF ARIUS? </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— If one must believe in reason, the very reason of
the names of Father and Son is a proof of their unity. If you ask how, I will
answer you that there is no true Son of God unless he has come out of the very
substance of the Father. Indeed, he cannot be true Son of God, if he does not
come from God. Now Scripture says he is the true Son of God, so he comes from
God. He who denies that Christ is born God contradicts Scripture, which
declares that He is true Son of God, to teach us that He is born of God. For if
he is not of God, and yet is called the true Son of God, Scripture misleads us.
If, on the contrary, Scripture cannot deceive us, he who does not acknowledge
that Christ is of God destroys the testimony of Scripture, and denies that
Jesus Christ is the true Son of God. It is not the will, but the birth that
makes the true Son of God. But the power of God, they say, is great enough to
give the lie the characters of truth. I answer that the power of God, and that
is why he is worthy of all our praises, makes truth the truth for him always,
and lies always lie. It belongs only to the liar to substitute the lie for the
truth, and God is incapable of it. God can do everything, it is true, but he
does only what is in conformity with his truth and justice. It is certain,
then, that Jesus Christ is called the true Son of God, in the proper sense,
that is, born of the very substance of God. What made the Apostle say: "He
did not spare his own Son.” (Rom. 8:32) And in another Epistle: "who,
though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be
grasped.” (Phil. 2:6) If, therefore, he did not regard himself to be equal to
God, he affirmed himself by the same true Son of God, for he could not be equal
to God except so much that he was born of God.<span> 
</span></font><font size="3">Equality is only possible between two things that are or equally true,
or equally false.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">One cannot establish
equality or unity between that which has a beginning and that which is eternal.
But Jesus Christ declaring that he is one with his Father is equal to God.
"The Jews," says the Evangelist, "reproached him not only for
violating the Sabbath, but for affirming that his Father was God, making
himself equal, that is to say, like God.” (Jn. 5:18) Is it not obvious that
this equality can only come from a birth properly so called? For it is by
affirming that he was the proper Son, that is, the true Son of God, that he
made himself equal to God. This is why he said to his disciples, "He who
sees me, see my Father." (Jn. 14: 9) By the same that they are consubstantial,
he who sees one sees both. Just as the Father has life in him, he has given his
Son to have life in him, (Jn. 5:26) that is to say, the Father begot a son who
is equal to him, and all that is to the Father is to the Son, as all that is to
the Son is to the Father (Jn. 17:10), and no one can take away anything from
the Father's hand or from the Son's hand. (Jn. 10:29) And he adds, "I and
my Father are one. I say to you, I tell you not of myself, but my Father who
dwells in me, do the works that I do. Do you not believe that I am in my
Father, and that my Father is in me? Believe it, at least because of the works
I do.” (Jn. 14:10) As the generation does not come from itself, but from the
one who has begotten it, it attributes all that it does to the Father, to
establish by all these testimonies that if he is called the true Son of God, it
is because he was born of him, and so that it was not supposed that his nature
was entirely outside the nature of God. The humility that appears in his words,
is here all his greatness. For while he seems to humble himself by saying to
his disciples, "What I say to you, I do not say it of myself, but it is my
Father who dwells in me who speaks and does the works that I do," (Jn.
14:10) proves his divine origin and power, affirming that what he is, he is not
of himself, but of his Father, far from Christ This is his finest title of
glory, for he who speaks of himself is not the true Son of God. As you can see,
the error of the Arians over the person of Jesus Christ comes precisely from
what should give them a just idea. They take occasion to condemn him and to
accuse him of false words which prove to the evidence that he is the true Son
of God.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">He asks his Father to glorify
him, and at the same time promises to glorify his Father to whom he addresses
his prayer, and his greatness comes here from his apparent humiliation. When
the Father bears witness to his Son, proclaiming his own glory, and when the
Son issues the greatness of the Father, he also manifests his own glory. The
greatness and nobility of the Father is the greatness and nobility of the true
Son. So all that we attribute to the Father belongs to the Son, and all that we
attribute to the Son belongs to the Father. Thus the Spirit whom we call the
Spirit of the Father, is also called the Spirit of Jesus Christ; the Church of
God is also the Church of Jesus Christ. We worship God, as we worship Jesus
Christ; we serve God, we serve Jesus Christ too. The saints are called the
priests of God, they are also called the priests of Jesus Christ.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">The holy city is enlightened by the light of
God, it is also illuminated by the light of Jesus Christ. The throne of God is
the same as that of Jesus Christ. God is the sovereign ruler, Jesus Christ too,
for the prophet Isaiah saw Christ seated on a throne of majesty as the God of
armies (Isa. 6:1); the Arians cannot deny it. It is written of God the Father
that he is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. (1 Tim. 6:15) The Scripture
recognizes the same titles to Jesus Christ the true Son of God. (Rev. 17:14,
19:16) Everywhere, therefore, we see perfect equality between the divinity of
the Father and the divinity of the Son, and the distinction of persons in no
way contradicts the unity of one God. The only difference that exists between
the Father and the Son is that the Father was not begotten, and the Son was
born, that is, the Father comes from no other and that the Son comes from the
Father, which is the greatness of the Son; for that is what makes us know his
eternal nobility, and that he is the true Son of the true Father, a truth that
these words of God express in Genesis: "Let us make man in our image and
likeness.” (Gen. 1:26) If they have the same image, the same resemblance, how
could they not have the same nature? In fact, in spiritual things where there
are no sensible forms, one thing can be similar to another only by its nature,
and if two things have the same image, they must not have same substance. The
Scripture tells us that they have the same image, the same resemblance to teach
us that one is no different from the other, that is to say, that Jesus Christ
is the true Son of God because his birth is not distinct here from him who
begets. So the Jews, who understood very well that he called God his Father in
the proper sense, say to Pilate: "We have a law, and according to this law
he must die, because he has made himself the Son of God.” (Jn. 19:7) What! the
Jews have understood this truth, and the Christians say that they do not
understand it; those who did not believe had the intelligence of these words,
and those who claim to have faith do everything not to understand! They will
admit at the same time that the prophet Isaiah, wishing to teach us that Christ
God does not come from himself but from God, expresses himself in these terms:
"They will walk behind you with their hands bound, we will see them
worship you, pray. A good is in you, they will say, and there is no God but
you. You are truly God, and we do not know it, God of Israel, O Savior!" (Isa.
45:14) These words are clear to a spirit of good faith, they clearly show that
the Father is in the Son, and the Son God is of the same nature as the Father, In
whom, he, in whom is God, without whom there is no other God, and who is God
himself, what can be that which is God the Father, without him Is there any
difference? This is really two to be one. God is in him, because although he is
God, he is not of himself, but of the Father, because he is a Son, and apart
from him there is no other God, because he is the only begotten Son of the
Father. He is God himself, because God and Christ have only one and the same
nature, so there remains no doubt here about this truth which is the object of
our faith, that the Father and the Son do not have the same nature. Christ is
the true Son of the true Father. This is what the prophet Jeremiah himself
predicts: "He is our God," he said, "and no one else will be
before him. He found all the ways of wisdom, who exposed them to Jacob his
servant, to Israel his beloved. After that he was seen on the earth, and
conversed with men." (Baruch, 3:36) Can we say of him who is of a lower
nature that no one else will be before him, or that he is a God different from
the Father, so that this title of God turns to the prejudice of the Father? If
no other God can be before him, and be outside the Father, see if you can admit
the consequence, for it is full of danger. It would follow, indeed, that he
would be greater than the Father. They imagine themselves to uphold the glory
of the Father by separating his Son from him, and they attack him, that is to
say, in their impious blindness they place the Son whose glory they wish to
diminish above the Father. to whose authority they want to subjugate it. Now,
Scripture to teach us that the Son does not differ from the Father (and he
would be different if he were not the true Son), says that no one else will be
before him, because one cannot find no other nature similar to the nature of
God which is the proper nature of Christ. In fact, he could not teach us more
clearly that Christ came from God than by declaring that no one else was before
him. He knew that the Son was in no way inferior to the Father, and to show his
perfect equality he said: "No other God will be before him," because
he is like God, equal to God his Father; for he is his true Son. The Prophet
again says: "He is our God," that is, the God of Israel.” If it is
he, he is the only God, for the Scripture says of him, "Hear, O Israel,
the Lord your God is the one and only God;” (Deut. 6:4) and yet he is not the
Father, but the Son of the Father. You see, then, that the personality of the
Son in no way prejudices the unity of God when we say of the Son that he is the
only God, since Scripture attests it in express terms. Where does that come
from? it is that the Father and the Son are but one; it is that unity is the
result of nature and not of the distinction of persons; it is that they are not
two, but only one. Nature is that they are not two Gods, but one God, whether
it be the Father who speaks, whether the Son, is always one God who speaks. For
if the Lord Himself said of man and woman. "They will not be two, but one
flesh," (Matt. 19:5) how much more the Father and the Son are not two
Gods, but one and the same nature? It is the birth of the Son that makes us
distinguish the Father and the Son and the unity of the divinity which opposes
us admitting two Gods. By what abnormality, however, do they maintain that
Christ was created, that is, done, while Scripture teaches us that God did
nothing without Christ? (Jn. 1:3) If nothing has been done without him, he
cannot have been made himself; for if he himself is one of the things that have
been done, something has been done without him. But far from us this thought,
because absolutely nothing exists without him. By his birth of God, he did not
begin to exist, his existence is eternal. His birth is nothing more than an
outing, and this outing is a manifestation. He was not made, he was born. To
express clearly that Christ had gone out from the substance of God, this exit
was given the name of birth; for as the birth is not distinct from the Father,
who is its author, it was well established that Christ was consubstantial with
God, and the error which said: He was when He was not found to be condemned;
for how to admit the nonexistence for a single instant of the one that
Scripture represents to us as proceeding from God, to teach us that he has
always been in God? No one can proceed from God unless he is in God. The
Arians, I know, explain this divine ﬁliation: Christ is called the true Son of
God, because God did it to be true; as if God could do something wrong. And
what will become of all the proofs so strong, so incontestable, that we have
previously given of the unity of the Father and the Son? If we are to adopt
another sentiment here, a great number of truths which have the support of
divine oracles for them will be shaken by a single discordant testimony. But
let them come to this last resource so that iniquity ceases to be pleasing to
them. God has therefore done it, they say, to be a true Son, his will here
being the agency of birth, and the creation replaces the generation. We must give
to the power of God, they add, all that is necessary for him to do things that
are not like those that exist. Since they have recourse to these cunning
discretions to attack the Son of God, we turn against them the same reasons
they trust so that their defeat is general in all respects. This proposition,
to take it only in its meaning, is of no importance, but if it is considered in
its terms, it is covered with a certain cloud which hides its meaning. It is
like an Egyptian placed in darkness, for a bad cause cannot be defended by a
good interpretation. They therefore resort, to defend their impiety, to
sacrilegious words. If, then, the power of God could have made Christ the true
Son of God without being born of him, he did it as he is, that is to say, that
the creation has produced here what the generation should give. If you say that
there is no difference between God and Christ, we may be able to think, given
the good faith of your assertion, that the affirmation is here in conformity
with reality, that Christ is truly the Son of God by that it is said that he
is, and that he is of the same nature as his Father, not by generation, but by
creation, because God can do everything, you say, and in particular that the
created be here as the uncreated. But if, by following the path traced to you
by reason, you declare that what has a beginning cannot be equal and
consubstantial with what is eternal, you reveal all the deceit of your bad
faith, because to evade the meaning terms, falsely claim that Christ is the
true Son of God, while denying that he is equal to God the Father; for he is
not his true Son if he is not equal to him. Can we call him the true Son of God
if God the Father is not truly his Father? If he is the true Son of God, the
Father is also truly Father, and equality is the proof of this truth. If
equality does not exist between them, one is not truer Father than the other is
true Son. But as the testimony of the Scriptures, which states that Jesus
Christ is the true Son of God, cannot be annulled, we must believe that he was
born of God the Father, because this truth is a consequence of his equality
with God that Scripture teaches us. But you, who recognize in God an
incomprehensible power, you say: God cannot engender, because it is a simple nature,
a language that is an insult to God the Father, for you accuse him of lying by
denying that he who claims to be his true Son is in indeed, and you expose your
hypocrisy, because you proclaim without believing in the power of God; for if
you recognize this power by asserting that it has brought out the truth from
lying, which is a mockery of the truth, how much more, if you were in good
faith, should you believe that what is called true indeed, and that the
testimony that God the Father has given to his Son is indisputable. Indeed, the
Lord said, "All things are possible to God," (Matt. 19:26) to
persuade us that what is impossible for men is not for God. If you consider
things only from the point of view of the flesh, you cannot admit that a virgin
has borne, nor that Jonah may have lived in the belly of the whale (Jon. 2:2),
nor that the dead can resurrect, nor God begot his Son, because a simple nature
cannot engender, because there is no generation in this world without union. We
must believe all these things or reject them all. If it is necessary to keep to
the natural reason of the world, its authority must have no bounds. If, on the
contrary, spiritual things have different rules, or ought to regard as carnal
the one who, imbued with the principles of the world, dares to deny that
something could have been done differently than he conceives it. They still
resort to other tricks and ask us this question: Is it by or against his will
that the Father has begot his Son? If we answer it by his will, they hasten,
like the enemies of the Son of God, to draw this conclusion: So the will of God
preceded the existence of the Son, and it is not eternal, then but the Son of
God did not begin to be, but simply exists by birth. If their reasoning were
well founded, the will would have preceded not only the Son, but the Father,
because the cause of the generation is at once in the Father and in the Son.
Unbelief follows in all things the inspirations of the flesh. God, to hear him,
did not act other than a man, he deliberated, he reflected carefully before
engendering, as if he were subject to the weakness of the human mind, while in
God the general is inseparable from the will, as the will is inseparable from
the generation; because the will is none other than the generation. We use, it
is true, the same terms to say: God did, man did, but the action of God is
quite different from the action of man; it is the same in all other
circumstances. We always have to talk about God in a way worthy of him. They
ask us another question about God the Father: The generation, they ask, has it
been for God the Father an accident, or is it of his nature to always beget?
They make this question to accuse God, who testifies that He begot Christ, and
make Christ not a true son, but a son of adoption. If he has begotten, they
say, he must always beget; and as he does not always beget, one must not
believe that he has begotten Christ. There would be so much reason to deny that
God created the world, because he does not create others. What irreverence,
what forgetfulness of all the rules, to lay down laws to God and to say to him:
If you have really begotten a Son, you must have spawned many, you have not
begotten a single one; that is, they do not believe in the Lord who has
declared that he is the only begotten Son of God. After having brought the
proofs that show the equality of the Father and the Son, let us see whether the
testimonies that Scripture gives to the Holy Spirit agree with these proofs, in
order to establish well that the Trinity, of which we profess the belief to be
saved, does not admit in the divine persons of distinction of nature, just as
it does not admit of difference in the faith which it demands; for although we
cannot be saved without one of the three divine persons, it is in all three the
same power that saves those who believe in them. We have quoted the words of
the Father who bore witness to the Son, let us now produce the words of the Son
who bear witness to the Holy Spirit, and who prove that the Holy Spirit is not
of a nature different from his. This testimony which the Father gives to the
Son and which the Son gives to the Holy Spirit is a demonstrative proof of the
unity of nature in the Trinity. Here is what the Lord says: “I will pray to my
Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you
eternally the Spirit of truth.” (Jn. 14:16) In promising another Paraclete, he
proves that he himself is a Paraclete or advocate. We read in the Epistle of
St. John: "We have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ, who prays for
our sins." (1 Jn. 2:1) The Savior says in another place: "I am the
truth.” This, then, is the clear unity of the Holy Spirit and the Son. The Son
attributes to the Holy Spirit the properties he attributes to himself. Let us now
see what the Scriptures provide us with in support of this truth. We read in
the prophet Isaiah "that he saw the God of armies seated on a throne of
majesty.” (Isa. 6:1) and St. John the Evangelist heard these words of Jesus
Christ saying, "This is what Isaiah prophesied when he saw his glory and
spoke of him.” (Jn. 13:41) The Apostle, on his side, declares that it is the
Holy Spirit. Here is what he says towards the end of the Acts of the Apostles:
"The Holy Spirit speaking to our fathers has said, You shall hear with
your ears, and you shall not understand.” (Acts 28:26) These words are those of
the Lord of hosts. He is the only God; whether one hears either the Father, the
Son, or the Holy Spirit, there is no contradiction, because they have only one deity
and one power. For if the edict of a single prefect of the courtroom is
considered as an order emanating from the other prefects because of the
authority and the power which are one, it is much more rightly than under the
empire of only one God, if one of the three comes to speak, we say in all truth
that the three spoke, for their nature is one as their will. They still seek to
diminish the authority of the Holy Spirit by presenting as a sign of
inferiority the third place which he occupies, while the divine Scriptures
express itself with such simplicity that often the third person is named the
first. They are placed according to the circumstances, and in this respect none
of them suffers any prejudice, because they have only one and the same divinity.
Thus, indeed, the Lord speaks through the mouth of the Lord: "I am the
first and I am eternally, it is my hand which founded the earth, it is my right
hand which has the heavens." (Isa. 48:12) And a little lower: "I
spoke, it was I who called him, who brought him, and I flattened every paths
before him. Come near to me and listen to this: From the beginning I did not
speak in secret, I was present when these things were resolved, and now I was
sent by the Lord God and by his Spirit.” (Isa. 48:15-16) Which one do you think
the earth has been with? He declares that he was sent. Is it the Father? No. It
is therefore the Son who declares himself sent by the Father and by the Holy
Spirit. Just as the Holy Spirit was sent by the Father and the Son, so Christ was
sent by the Father and by the Holy Spirit. The exclusive privilege of the
Father is to be sent by no one. Listen to what the Apostle says and how he
enumerates in a different order the people of the Holy Trinity. Here is how he
expresses himself in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians: "May the
Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Jesus Christ.”
(2 Thess. 3:5) What does he mean here by the Lord, if not the Holy Spirit? And
what is astonishing that he gives to the Holy Spirit the name of Lord of armies
that Isaiah gives to him whom he saw sitting on a throne of majesty, as we have
said above? The apostle Saint John himself hears of the Holy Spirit when he
says of God: "In this we know that God dwells in us because he has made us
participate in his Spirit.” (1 Jn. 4:13) If it is through his Spirit that he
abide in us, there is no doubt that the Holy Spirit is from God, and it is no
less certain that what is of God is God. This is what made the Apostle says:
"No one knows what is in God except the Spirit of God.” (1 Cor. 2:11) But
how can he know what is in God unless he has the same divine nature? An
inferior nature cannot know what is contained in a superior nature, how much
less can a mere creature know what is in its creator? The Apostle, in his first
Epistle to the Corinthians, reverses the order which the tradition of faith has
consecrated and begins with the Holy Spirit the enumeration of the graces and
the science of mysteries; He places our Lord Jesus Christ second, and places
God the third, God the Father who works, says he, in the Holy Spirit and in the
Lord (1 Cor. 12:1) according to this word of the Savior: "My Father, who
dwells in me, does the works that I do.” (Jn. 14:10) By the same thing that the
Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ proceed from God the Father, their operation is
the work of God. Besides, the same Apostle gives the Holy Spirit the name of
Lord and the Lord the name of God because of their unity of nature. Now, having
said in such a place that this God, who is the Lord, works all things in all,
Saint Paul concludes: "Now it is one and the same spirit that works all
these things, distributing to each one his gifts, according to what it
pleases." (1 Cor. 12:11) Is it possible to establish more clearly that the
three persons have only one operation, because as soon as one acts, the three
act with it, as having only the same divinity. It is a certain truth that the
gift of graces is the proper work of the Holy Spirit, but to teach us that God,
our Lord, and the Holy Spirit are only one because of the identity of nature,
the Apostle shows us the work of the Holy Spirit as being common to the three
persons. In the same way, to teach us that it is the proper work of the Holy
Spirit as a divine person, he adds: and it is one and the same Spirit who
operates all these things, distributing his gifts according to what he chooses.
He says according to what he pleases, because his will is the very will of God,
for he does not say as God wants, but as the Holy Spirit wants. Indeed, the
creature strives to do the will of God, while the Holy Spirit naturally wants
what God wants. Now, to put this truth in all its glory, that the Holy Spirit
works all these things, Our Lord said to the Jews, "If I cast out demons
by the finger of God, etc.," (Luke 9:20) Here he calls the Holy Spirit the
finger of God to prove that he is from God. And he does not hesitate to accuse
them of blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, the Jews who said he was driving out
demons by Beelzebub, prince of demons. When Moses himself performed his
prodigies by the Holy Spirit, the magicians are obliged to exclaim: "The
finger of God is here." (Exod. 8:19) We still read in the Acts of the Apostles:
"During that they sacrificed to the Lord and that they loved, the Holy
Ghost said to them, Separate Paul and Barnabas for the work to which I have
called them." (Acts 13:2) It is to the Lord that they are sacrificed, and
the Holy Spirit attributes to himself this act of religion, a clear proof that
he is the Lord God, like God the Father, it is Jesus Christ who, from heaven,
called Paul and sent him to preach, and the Holy Spirit still attributes to
himself this mission in disarray: "For the work to which I have called
them," and yet no one is ignorant that it is the Savior who instituted
bishops at the head of the churches. It was he who, before ascending to heaven,
gave the Apostles pontifical consecration by laying hands on them. However, the
Apostle does not fail to attribute this institution to the Holy Spirit when he
says: "Be attentive to yourselves and to the flock with which the Holy
Spirit has established you bishops to rule the Church of the Lord Jesus."
(Acts 20:28) Peter also said to Ananias, "</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Ananias, why did Satan fill your heart to make you lie
to the Holy Spirit?” (Acts 5:3) And he adds, "You have not lied to men,
but to God.” It is evident that he calls God the Holy Spirit to whom Ananias
lied. Had he not wanted to make it known that the Holy Spirit is God, he would
have said: You have not lied to men, but to the Holy Spirit, so as not to make
the Holy Spirit look like God, not like a man. And what is there in this
amazing? The Apostle calls man sometimes the temple of God, sometimes the
temple of the Holy Spirit, because they are one by their nature (2 Cor. 6:16; 1
Cor. 6:19); if he would not make us understand that the Holy Spirit is God, how
could he say below: "The temple of God is holy, and you are the temple? (1
Cor. 3:17) All the Scriptures teach us the existence of one God, but we worship
in the Trinity the mystery of one God. The Scripture thus expresses itself so
that in this belief in one God we understand that what proceeds from Him, that
is, the Son and the Holy Spirit, deserves the same honors we give to God; for
the mystery of God has been revealed to us to make his glory appear in the
Trinity.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">Scripture does not always
formally give the name of God to what proceeds from God so as not to suggest
that there is another God apart from the one who is the only God. But it gives
us intelligence to lead us to believe that the salvation of men depends on
faith in the Trinity, because the three divine persons have the same divinity;
for one could not join together and place on the same rank the Creator and the
creatures, the Lord and the servants, the eternity and the beings who have a
beginning, especially since there is no salvation for any man without faith to
one of these three persons. It would be an offense to give the name of God to
all that we call God, the Son, or the Holy Spirit, if we give them an honor, a
glory other than the honor and glory which are due to an only God. The holy Scriptures
thus show that Christ is God, that the Holy Spirit is God, so that those who
see him know and understand the nature of what is shown to them. Here is a man
who shows a pearl without saying that it is a pearl; will it be a pearl because
this man does not say so expressly? Thus the Scriptures show by all the
testimonies that we have brought what we must believe, by enclosing our spirits
in faith to one God considered in the mystery of the Trinity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

43. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHAT REASONABLE ANSWER CAN ONE MAKE
FROM THE LAW TO THE IMPIETY OF THE ARIANS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— If one must believe in reason,
etc. It is therefore evident that Christ is called the true Son of God, as his
own Son, that is, born of his substance. This is what makes the Apostle say:
"He did not spare his own Son." The very reason for the names of Father
and Son teaches us that the Father and the Son share the same nature. Human
reason is too weak to reach the knowledge of this mystery. That is why these
grand truths have received names which help to conceive the truth of the
existence of the Father and the Son. Well, indeed, does not show better that
Our Lord Jesus Christ proceeds from God than the name of Son of God given to
Him. And as malignity has found a way to misuse these names to give them a
meaning different from that which they naturally have, Scripture adds, "He
is the true Son," to silence these impious mouths and to those evil
spirits. We will even say that no one falls into heresy except by departing
from the reason of names; simple and upright minds, which do not deviate from the
meaning of names, remain inviolately attached to the Catholic faith. Simplicity
calmly considers what has been taught to it by tradition. When doubts arise,
questions arise over truths clearly and simply formulated, and that not
satisfied with believing what the words express, men consider it unworthy of
them not to add or not to take away something, they fall from the heights of
the divine tradition. For the righteous spirits, all their solicitude is that
their faith in God is according to tradition. Now, the only meaning of the
names of Father and Son leads to the truth of the perfect unity that exists
between them. It cannot be supposed that there is a difference between those
whom Scripture represents under the same image, and whom the Son himself
confirms when he says: "He who sees me, sees my Father." (Jn. 14:9)
If, then, he who sees one of them sees them both, the Father and the Son
certainly have one and the same form, which can only be so long as the Father
and the Son are one and the same substance. And this does not cast doubt on
what happens among men, how can one ascertain the existence of the true Son? when
the identity of nature is supported by the property of the names of the
begotten and the created; for who can generate anything other than himself? If
Christ was simply called the Son of God, and the Scripture did not add for
greater clarity that He is the true Son of God, to the testimony of the Apostle
St. John, "We are in his true Son Jesus Christ, who is the true God and
eternal life;” (Jn. 5:20) and St. Paul: "He did not spare his own
Son," there might be some doubt as to the meaning of the only name of the
Son. But Scripture clearly says that He is the true Son of God; therefore those
who go against the natural signification of this expression become their own
enemies. They imagine, and under the influence of a false and perverse opinion,
they affirm that one must believe something other than what is contained in the
reason of faith, as if they wanted to give to God more than him. Even those who
believe in him do not want it. If Scripture had not added to the word Son the
qualification of truth, we might perhaps doubt. One could say that these words
of the Savior: "He who sees me, see my father," signifies that he is
like his Father, as milk is like plaster, similar in color, but very different
from nature. But, no, as these words are the words of the true Son of God, we
must admit that they signify in his mind that the Father and the Son have one
and the same nature, and that they do not differ in any way. If indeed the
Savior said of the man and the woman, because they have the same nature:
"They are no longer two but one flesh," (Matt. 19:6) how much more
must one be careful not to say that the Father and the Son are two, so as not
to give rise to the error that their nature is separate, divided, or at least
different and dissimilar? Finally, the apostle Saint Paul confirms this unity
of nature of the Father and the Son when he says: "He did not look as a
usurpation to be equal to God. "(Philip. 2:6) Now, where does this
equality come from, if not from the unity of nature, both have one and the same
image. The Apostle said, "He</span></font><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">did
not count equality with God," the Savior Himself called himself the true
Son of God, for He could not be equal to God except so much as He proceeded
from God: there is no equality possible except between two subjects who are
both true or both false. This equality, this unity cannot exist between what
had a beginning and what is eternal. So, when Jesus Christ declares that he is
one with his Father, he proclaims himself equal to God. "Not only did the
Jews reproach him,” says the Evangelist, for breaking the Sabbath, but for
saying that “God was his Father and to make himself equal to God," that
is, to the Father. Is it not obvious that this equality comes from birth? For
it is by asserting himself the proper Son, the true Son of God, that he made
himself equal to God, and that is why he said: "He who sees me, see my
Father," that is, to say that both are of the same nature, the one who
sees one sees them both. "For as the Father has life in himself, so has he
given to his Son to have life in himself," that is to say, an equal life, etc.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WORDS OF THE SAVIOR: "I GIVE YOU MY PEACE, I LEAVE YOU MY PEACE, I DO NOT
GIVE IT TO YOU AS THE WORLD GIVES IT?” </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— He who receives the peace of the Savior becomes the
enemy of the world. If he is not at war with the devil, he will not have peace
with Jesus Christ. No one can serve two masters. (Matt. 6:24) He therefore who
is at war with the world is one who faithfully observes the law of God, and
who, strong in the peace of Jesus Christ, repels all the features of his
enemies. Who would dare to undertake against him whom he knows to be the friend
of the king? However, the world gives peace otherwise than the Savior promises
to give it. The world gives peace out of fear or because it is asked of it. But
the Savior, whose strength has no equal, fears no one, and gives no peace only
because he is prayed to. It is the peace of the Savior that he gives us as a
bulwark against our enemies. One name serves to express the peace of God and of
the world; but what an immense distance separates them! One is fragile, the
other is firm; one is carnal, the other is spiritual; this one is terrestrial,
that one is celestial; the first is the effect of necessity, the second is all
voluntary. Jesus Christ who needs no one offers peace to those who are weak,
disarmed; he offers it as the Lord has his subjects, as a good master to bad
servants, as God to men. He is therefore right in saying: "I do not give
it to you as the world gives it”; By this he brings to light the whole extent
of goodness and his mercy. Every man grants peace to be profitable to him; the
Savior gives it not in his interest, but in the interest of those who receive
it. The world therefore gives peace differently than the Savior gave. And this
peace of the world does not teach the holy and pure life, it does not persuade
patience, it does not excite the works of justice, it does not exhort to mercy,
it does not promise eternal life. He, on the contrary, who has received the
peace of Jesus Christ, is far from all the vices of the world which give
violent battles to the soul.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

3:10) He predicts that after his passion, the Holy Spirit will show that he has
spoken the truth. To convince the world is, therefore, to show him the truth of
things he did not wish to believe. So he refused to believe that he was the
Savior sent from God. Now the Savior, after having fulfilled all righteousness,
did not hesitate to return to the one who had sent him, and by the very fact
that he was returning to heaven, he proved that he had come. "For no one,"
he says, "goes back to God except the one who descended from God.” When
the powers saw him ascending into the heavens, they were confounded by seeing
the truth of what they had despised as a lie. He therefore gives them the
conviction of that righteousness by which he ascends into the heavens from
which he descended. He then convinces them of sin, because not only did they
not believe in him, but put him to death. He finally convinces them with regard
to judgment, by revealing the iniquity of the prince of the world, and his
condemnation by him whom they did not believe. Seeing the souls come out of
limbo to go to heaven, they knew that the prince of this world was judged, and
that, being found guilty of the death of the Savior, he lost all his rights over
those whom he held captive. This is what we saw when the Savior ascended to
heaven, but what appeared with more brilliance when the Holy Spirit descended
on the Apostles. What a more genuine judgment than that pronounced against the
world, when after the passion and resurrection of Our Lord, this deceitful
world saw the public testimonies which the risen dead, the lame who walked, the
healed lepers, delivered to the Savior, the paralyzed, the blind, who saw, the
deaf who heard, the mute who spoke, the possessed delivered, the sick who
thanked him for having healed them of their infirmities? This is how the Holy
Spirit convinced the world by performing these miracles of healing in the name
of the Savior who had been reproved by the world.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

kinds of prayers are thus formulated for Christians: one asks that their sins
be forgiven, and that they be protected from the pursuits of the devil. As for
those who have no faith, the only thing that can be asked for them is that
instead of inflicting on them the just punishment of their sins, of their
unbelief, the goodness and patience of God are waiting for them, their
repentance and their conversion. We cannot pray to God, in fact, to forgive
sins for those who do not believe; what one can ask for is to give them a long
delay, so that their repentance can bring them to remission of their sins. The

SHE WANTED TO TOUCH HIM IN THE EXCESSES OF HIS JOY: “DO NOT TOUCH ME, FOR I
HAVE NOT YET ASCENDED TO MY FATHER,” WHILE WE READ THAT THE OTHER HOLY WOMEN
TOUCHED HIM AND WORSHIPED HIM?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
— These words, "Do not touch me," are an expression of discontent,
and although Mary Magdalene desired to see the Savior, yet while others
believed in his resurrection, she continued to stand near the sepulcher
shedding tears, whereas she should have rejoiced at the news that the Apostles
John and Peter had taught her that the Lord had risen. And indeed we read in
the Gospel: "She saw the linen and the shroud placed in one place, and she
believed, for she did not yet know the oracles of Scripture which predicted
that the Savior should rise again." But Mary did not believe, because she
had not seen with her eyes the resurrection of her divine Master. The excess of
her love was the cause of her doubt. Are those we love in trials, we can not
believe that they can come out of them; for those, on the contrary, whom we
hate, would they be two steps from death, we cannot add to it. Our Lord,
therefore, presents himself to Mary, whom her love cast into desolation and
sorrow, whereas she should have imitated the faith of the disciples, to console
her, but it is not without a certain expression of discontent; that is why he
says to her, "Do not touch me," that is to say, you seek a too
sensible satisfaction, abstain and rise to the spiritual things that are not
seen, because he adds, “I have not yet gone back to my Father." These
words have a certain analogy with those of St. John the Baptist sending his
disciples to Jesus and saying to them: “Go and say, John the Baptist has sent
us to you to ask, Are you the one to come or do we to wait for another?” (Matt.
11; Luke 7) He pleads the cause of his disciples while appearing to speak only
in his name. In fact, John could not have the slightest doubt about the person
of the Savior, who had said of him: "Here is the Lamb of God, who is the
one who takes away the sins of the world.” (Jn. 1:29) It is therefore in the
interest of his disciples that he sends them to make this request in his name,
so that the Savior may confirm with his own mouth what he has taught them of
his divine person, and that after his death his disciples follow in the
footsteps of Jesus Christ without any hesitation. This is how the Savior in his
person reproaches Mary by saying to her: “I have not yet ascended to my Father,”
that is to say, your heart is still too much attached to the earth, and if you
do not see point, you cannot bring yourself to believe. In her, if she had
raised her heart to God, she would have believed with the disciples in the
resurrection of the Savior.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

PENTECOST AND THE REASON FOR ITS INSTITUTION?</font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> — It is certain that all the
institutions of our religion borrow their strength from the Old Testament, and
bear as the seal of the testimony of the old law. Indeed, all the events that
took place under the old law were so many figurative signs of our faith, so
that we cannot doubt the truth of the teachings that we propose to our belief,
when we see them announced so much centuries ago, not only by words, but by the
much more powerful language of facts. Now, if we do not have to hear the things
figured in the same way as the figurative signs, we now have to consider what
is the origin of the feast of Pentecost and the reason for its institution. The
divine Scriptures reveal their mysterious meanings to the attentive and
religious souls, and keep them closed for careless souls. It was not proper,
indeed, that a truth whose intelligence is reserved to those whom their merits
render worthy, should be manifested indifferently to all. Here is the reason
for the institution of Pentecost. Just as the day of the Lord is the first to
begin again the week and the day when the mystery of the Passover was fulfilled
for the redemption of the human race (because after a period of seven days we
are necessarily returning to the first day of the week, which teaches us that
the duration of the world will be consumed by the number seven, and that it
will thus reach eternal rest); so Pentecost is the first day after seven weeks.
Never does Pentecost fall another day until the day of the Lord, to teach us
that all the mysteries which have for their object the salvation of men began
and were fulfilled on the Lord's day. It is the day of the Lord that the world
was created, just as after the fall, it was the day of Sunday that was
repaired, and the figure of this repair was given to us in circumcision which
was the sign of future faith. Indeed, after the past week, the eighth day is
the first for a mysterious reason. This is the day the Lord has made. He only
did this one day, and it was from him that all others should come into being. That
is why he was resurrected the day he did, and according to the number we have
given reason. It was on this day that he gave the law of Sinai through his
servant Moses, so that the law was the figure of the evangelical preaching, as
the paschal lamb had been the figure of the Savior's passion. Indeed,
Pentecost, that is to say, the law was given to the Jews the same day that the
Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles to assume them with a divine authority,
and to give them the knowledge of evangelical preaching. This fact is thus
confirmed by a double proof, because it has been predicted and figured, and
that the Holy Spirit by this visible manifestation proves the divinity and
supernaturality of this event, of which our law receives the most glorious testimony.
Uneducated men who issue in various languages ​​before strangers the greatness
of God, show that they are divinely inspired. The law was therefore given by
Moses to the children of Israel on the third day of the third month, as we read
in the book of Exodus (Exod. 19:16), and that day is the fiftieth day or the
day of<span>  </span></font><font size="3">Pentecost since the fourteenth
day of the first month Passover was celebrated in Egypt. The Holy Spirit
therefore descended on the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1), to inaugurate
the preaching of the new law, in order to show that the old events were the
figures of future events, and thus to give a new pledge of certainty to our
faith; for one cannot look upon what was announced from the beginning as false.
This is why the psalm fifty describes the time of the remission of sins and
reparation, to teach us that the same providence had designated the fiftieth
day and the first. That is why the manna again fell from heaven to feed the
Jewish people on the first day, which is the day of the Lord, as the following
six days prove, during which the Israelites gathered the manna to rest the
seventh, that is to say, the Sabbath day. (Exod. 16:14) Now, the manna is the
figure of this spiritual food, which after the resurrection of the Lord has
become a truth in the mystery of the Eucharist. All these things have been
accomplished to return to harmony with the fact of the first resurrection, so
that Satan cannot gloat, but he is as stunned, he who by his deceptive hopes
has made man fall from the heights where Jesus Christ had placed it. We now
have to prove that things must be understood in the way we have exposed them.
The fourteenth day of the first month that the Passover was celebrated in Egypt
was the fourth day of the week. (Exodus 12:2) What gives us reason to hear it
thus, is that the fifteenth day of the second month, which was the day of the
departure of the children of Israel, seems to have been the day of the Sabbath,
so it was not that day, but the evening only that this cloud of quail was sent
to them from heaven. The manna fell from the sky in the morning, that is to say
the day of the Lord who is the first of the week that begins again. They
collected the manna six days in a row, and rested on the seventh day, which was
the Sabbath day. Now count from this day until the third day of the third month
when the law has been given, and you will find that it is the fourth day of the
week that the law was given. In fact, from the fifteenth day of the second
month, Sabbath day, to the third day of the third month, there are ninety days.
Take back the nineteen days, and return to the fifteenth day of the second
month, which was the Sabbath day, before which fourteen days are from the
first, and go to the first day of the second month, and you will have fourteen
more days. Add them to the nineteen days of which we have spoken, and you will
find that the first day of the second month was the Sabbath day. Add at the
head of the first month seventeen days, because this first month must be cut
off from the thirteen days preceding Passover; indeed, it is the fourteenth day
of the first month that the Passover was celebrated. By removing thirteen days
and adding another seventeen days, you will find that the fourteenth day of the
first month was the fourth of the week. And to avoid the boredom of a longer
enumeration or the trouble of examining each member of this question in detail,
I give you an abridgment here, so that you know for sure how many days have
elapsed from the Passover until the day when the law was given, and you can
more easily conclude which day of the week the Passover was celebrated. The law
was given on the third day after the second month. So here we have two months
and three days. Take away from these two months the thirteen days that preceded
the feast of Passover, and it will remain fifty days. It is easy to see now
that the law was given on the fourth day of the week. The manna fell from the
sky on the first day, since the Israelites collected it for six consecutive days,
the first day of the week was the sixteenth of the second month. By going from
this first day to the eighteenth of the month when the law was given, you will
still find the fourth day of the week. Now, if you count on this fourth day,
either ascending or descending until the fiftieth, you will fall on the fourth
day, and the reason is that the Jews celebrated the Passover in Egypt on the
fourth day of the week, that they also received the law on the fourth day, and
that they departed from Egypt on the fifth day. The promulgation of the law is
therefore the feast of Pentecost.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

heard here in the sense of being born. There is no doubt a difference between
what is done and what is begotten, but in other matters where there is no

Apostle used this expression which he still uses in another place: "He was
made or formed of a woman," he tells us. (Gal. 4) So it has a special
meaning here. The Apostle used it on purpose because the flesh of the Lord was
not produced, nor his body formed of a principle from man, but by the operation
and virtue of the Holy Spirit. There is indeed a great difference between the
formation of the blood, the generation due to the union of the two sexes, and
the conception which is the effect of a supernatural power. This is why the

MOSES, A HOLY AND JUST LAW, A GOOD AND SPIRITUAL LAW (ROM. 7:12). ELSEWHERE HE
SAID, THE LAW PROVOKES ANGER, AND WHERE THERE IS NO LAW, THERE IS NO
TRANSGRESSION (ROM. 4:15). INDEED, THE ABSENCE OF LAW AND TRANSGRESSION IS A
CAUSE OF SECURITY. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
By carefully comparing these two passages, you could have solved this question
yourself, because it is the characteristic of critical minds to raise
difficulties by complaining of encountering antilogies, contradictions in the
words of an author who does not offer a trace of it. The Apostle calls the law
a holy and just law, good and spiritual; to establish faith, it would suffice
for the testimony of this man so worthy of all praise, and leaning everywhere
on the truth; and it would only remain to examine without obstinacy and without
prevention what seems contradictory in his words. But no, the question that one
raises would want to arrive at the liberty of sin. We must therefore remember
that the Apostle proposes to establish the superiority of the law of faith
under the reign of grace in his epistle to the Romans who, under the guise of
the faith of Jesus Christ, had allowed himself to be subjected to the law. This
law is not the natural law, for the Romans were subject to this law only ten
men sent from Athens, and two others afterwards had brought them; this law was
written on two tables which were buried under the ruins of the capitol. St.
Paul therefore wants to speak here of the law which is called the law of truths,
which commands circumcision, the observance of the Sabbath and the new moons,
the distinction of food, the honorable purification of the vessels, and the
other observances prescribed by the law: it is from this law that he says that
he produces anger, for God, angry with his people, added these prescriptions to
be like a heavy burden to the infidelity of the Jews; in fact it was almost
impossible not to transgress any of these laws so multiplied. This is what made
the apostle St. Peter say: "Why do we want to impose on our brothers a
yoke that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?" (Acts 15) God
also says through his prophet Jeremiah, "I gave them imperfect
precepts." (Ezek. 20) After their multiplied offenses, their repeated
murmurs against God, which they continually tempted, and their outrages upon
Moses, he imposed on them these precepts, the observation of which must weigh
on their head so hard, for on whatever side they might turn, they met the law
which left them no rest, and to deliver them from this law, the Apostle says to
them, "Where there is no law, there is no transgression," so that
they may safely serve God spiritually in a shorter way, wanting to observe the
law of the Jews he said to them, it is necessary that you should become the
prevaricators, for the precepts are so numerous and so difficult that it is
impossible to fulfill them, and the Apostle would not speak so in speaking of
the natural law because Moses only wrote for to affirm the authority of this
law, not that it did not exist before, since we see that before Moses the
transgression was punished. The Apostle therefore wished to teach the Romans
that they should no longer live under the law, because their interest made them
a duty to practice the law. Indeed, there was no other way for them to observe
justice. This is what the Apostle tells them in another place: "Do you
want to have no fear of power? Do good," and again: "Those who
resist, draw on them damnation." (Rom. 13:2) He therefore calls spiritual
this law which he showed holiness, justice and goodness. This is the law that
we call natural who defends sin, and who is given to us as a guide in the way
of good. The law of faith which is added to this law makes the man perfect. As
the name of law is a generic name, the Apostle here seems to speak against the
law, but to establish that he does not want to destroy this law which gives the
necessary direction to our lives, he says, "We know that the law is
spiritual," to see thus that the law which he fights is the law of the
sabbath, circumcision, food, and new moons, the first is called spiritual
because it punishes all sins.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

ENEMY OF GOD, OR WHAT IS THIS WISDOM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF GOD? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— This question, as to the meaning,
does not differ from the preceding one in which we have explained what St. Paul
means by the flesh; we can therefore know more easily what is the wisdom of the
flesh. We have said that the name of flesh is given to all elements, it is to
all visible beings who have the principle that nothing can be done without a
mixture of simple substances and which have a horror and treat of madness the
reason and the action of power. In fact, those who do not believe in spiritual
things and follow the inspirations of the flesh do not esteem and admit as true
that which is contained in the nature of the elements. Thus they refuse to
believe in the virgin birth, in the resurrection of the flesh, because the
nature of the flesh, that is, of the elements, does not admit such phenomena.
In fact, all the beings that are begotten in time are only by the effect of the
mixture of different substances, and the bodies once dead and fallen into
dissolution cannot be restored to life, for every element under of dissolution,
resumes its own nature. Swollen with these vain prejudices, they openly deny
what we believe we have already done, or have to make, and by the same their
affirmations are enemies of God, because they treat with madness and lies what
God has made and promised to do.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

49. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHAT IS THIS SPIRIT OF WHICH THE
APOSTLE AFFIRMS AND DESIRES SALVATION WHEN HE SAYS: "I GAVE HIM UP TO
SATAN FOR THE DEATH OF THE FLESH, THAT HIS SPIRIT MAY BE SAVED, ETC."? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The death of the flesh takes
place when one gives oneself to the pleasures and desires of the flesh, and
thus makes oneself worthy of hell, for one thus buys death at the price of the
works of the flesh. Through these works man becomes carnal; for just as by
living in the law he becomes all spiritual until then, when he participates in
spirituality and takes the name of the soul; thus living according to the
desires of the world and guilty pleasures, he becomes wholly carnal in all his
being and tends entirely towards the death of the flesh. And to explain this
truth even more clearly, just as the flesh that is fragile, corruptible and
mortal, losing the soul loses all its beauty and all its form and dies, because
to die for it is to lose what gave the life to all its members; thus the soul
loses all its beauty and all its form in contact with that body whose vigor has
despised the soul united to the flesh and plunged it into all the defilements
of vice. Far, therefore, that the soul can be of no use to the flesh, the flesh
becomes for the soul a cause of death, because the soul which God had given as queen
to the flesh did not govern the body spiritually, but taught him to do the
works of the flesh. So when the Church rejects such a man from within, she
keeps the spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit who is the protector of the Church,
for if they had suffered in the midst of this man who dared to defile the wife
of his father, because they had the design to arm himself against the law to preserve
others from his contact, and that this crime forces the Holy Spirit to withdraw
from the Church, we can no longer say that the Church has preserved the Spirit.
In fact, one does not keep what one loses, and when in the day of the Lord they
appear to be stripped of the Spirit, they cannot be admitted to the number of
the children of God, for it is the Spirit who makes us bear witness that we are
the children of God. The Apostle addresses himself here to the people, because
not all the churches had bishops yet. He therefore commands the faithful to do
what the bishop would do if he were at their head, that is to say, to unite all
to reject him from the bosom of the Church and not appear to be accomplices of
his crime. He who does not take back a culprit, when he can, but who welcomes
him as if he were innocent, increases for him the ease of sinning, and by the
same defiles his soul and puts to flight the Holy Spirit. St. Paul writing to
the Thessalonians said to them in the same sense: "May your spirit, your
soul, and your body be kept intact and undefiled for the coming of Our Lord.”
(1 Thess. 5:23) This is the same meaning, since to be kept safe and to be
intact means one and the same thing. So the king said to Daniel, "Are the
seals safe?" (Dan. 14:16), Daniel answers him, "Yes, king, they are
safe,” that is to say, “intact." So the Spirit is intact for us, when it
does not abandon us. Those whom the Holy Spirit abandons, are no longer intact
for the work of regeneration, because they no longer have in them the one that
gave them to be called God's children. There is no contradiction in saying that
the Holy Spirit abandons us when we sin, and that he is no longer intact or
whole. We are abandoned by the one who was our guide and our master, for if he
is our leader we are his members, and when we do an action which displeases
him, he is not the one who abandons us, it is we who abandons him, and then he
seems to be no longer intact and whole in losing us. It is an obvious truth
that he is not the one who walks away from us, but we who walks away from him
when we sin. The Apostle in his Epistle to the Colossians said to them,
"Whose whole body is supported by his bonds and by his joints, converses
and increases for the increase of the Lord God." (Col. 2:19) These words
if we hear them in their literal sense, they do not seem to be admissible, for
there is no void in God which we are called to fill, but when we return to the
author of our life, and confess that he is our God he seems to acquire us for
salvation, and his divinity take in us from increase in our soul, while it
undergoes a real decrease in those who are departing from him and undergo a
decrease are therefore two synonymous expressions.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

50. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">THERE IS A GREAT NUMBER OF SINS
WHOSE BODY IS THE OBJECT, FOR EVERY MAN WHO COMMITS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE ON ANY
PART OF HIS BODY, SIN AGAINST HIS BODY. THUS THIS ONE MUTILATES HIMSELF, THAT
ONE HANGS HIMSELF, THIS OTHER PLUNGES A DAGGER INTO THE BREAST. WHY THEN DOES
THE APOSTLE SAY, "EVERY SIN THAT MAN COMMITS IS OUTSIDE HIS BODY, BUT HE
WHO GIVES HIMSELF UP TO FORNICATION SINS AGAINST HIS BODY?"</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — Do you want to accuse the
Apostle of ignorance, or do you simply want the explanation of these words?
Saint Paul under the name of body, includes not only the man but the woman,
because the woman is a part of the man. Now, all these crimes of which we speak
above, that is to say those acts of violence to which we are against ourselves,
do not defile the whole body, because the man sins alone, and by the same
becomes guilty only. In fornication, on the contrary, the defilement extends to
the whole body, because the consent to the crime is at the same time the fact
of the man and the woman, that is why the fornication is a crime so serious,
because it is pushing the sin until the excess, than to seek an accomplice to
his crime. If the virtuous man receives the reward due to the one he has won
for good, and if the vicious man is not only punished for himself, but for the
one he associates with his condemnation, how much more who commits fornication,
and who by one sin imprints upon himself, so to speak, a double defilement?
Indeed, as soon as he sinned against the flesh that comes from him, he
dishonors himself by a double adultery. If we wish to give another explanation
of this question, by applying these words either to the Church or to the body
of Jesus Christ, this interpretation cannot be admitted. It is to violently
divert the meaning of these words and to resemble Novatian who, to defend his
extravagances, claims that the one who commits fornication, does not sin
against his body, but against the body of Jesus Christ, because Christians are
the body of Jesus Christ, that is, fornication is the same as sacrilege, and he
who is guilty of it sin against Jesus Christ as he who denies Jesus Christ.
Now, nothing weaker and more fragile than this interpretation, on whatever side
it turns, it falls into difficulties that it is impossible for it to avoid.
Indeed, if the Lord sins against the body of Jesus Christ, the other sins will
no longer be offenses against Jesus Christ. For example, the crime of a
Christian who kills his brother, sacrificed to idols, or is guilty of some
other sin, because all sin is outside the body, except fornication. If, on the
contrary, all sin is not outside the body, but all without exception, are so
many direct offenses against Jesus Christ, it must be said that the thief, the
perjurer, the liar, the one who strikes his brother, or commits some other
similar crime, sins against Jesus Christ or against the Holy Spirit, which is
supremely absurd, and yet the Apostle calls the members of the Church the body
of Jesus Christ, and we are members of each other. How, then, does the
fornicator sin against his body, and not against the body of Jesus Christ? Because
it is from the mystery of the formation of the Church that we are called not
our body, but the body of Jesus Christ. This explanation is further removed
from the question we are dealing with, because the fornicator sins against his
body, because Adam is defiled by this sin.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

51. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHY DOES THE APOSTLE SAY THAT HE
HAS BECOME ALL THINGS TO EVERYONE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE FAULT OF A FANATIC AND
A HYPOCRITE?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — The
adversary gives his approval not to oppose the one whom he wishes to render
favorable. He who, to avoid scandal, does something which has no danger, it is
true, but which is also useless, desires the salvation of him to whom he will
spare scandal. When the Apostle St. Paul circumcised his disciple Timothy, who
had caused the Jews, and purified himself before entering the temple, he did so
not to scandalize those who defended with exceeding zeal the traditions of
their fathers, and who could have put him to death or looked at our religion as
being directly opposed to them. He therefore consented to submit to a less
important observance to earn more. He might have exposed himself to a grave
fault by not going as a Jew in the temple to pray; he therefore submitted in
their interest to this prescription. He also lent himself to the way of seeing
of those who were under the law, that is, Samaritans, in that they admitted
that the books of Moses came from God, and that circumcision and the Sabbath
were also divine institutions. It was by means of these books that he proved to
them that the Christ whom they hoped for was the one whom he preached to them.
This is what the Samaritan woman utters when she says to the Lord: "I know
that the Messiah must come, when he comes, he will tell us all things. (Jn.
4:25) It is according to this principle and in this sense that the Apostle went
through all the books of Moses who said, "The Lord your God will raise up
a prophet from among your brethren." (Deut. 18:15) Saint Paul is still
made to those who were under the law, in this respect that they recognize that
the world and the human race have God as author. This is why he says to them:
As some of your poets have said: We are the children of God himself. (Acts
17:28) This is how he made himself all for the sake of their salvation.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  DO THESE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE MEAN: "LET ONLY HUMAN TEMPTATIONS COME TO
  YOU?" </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— It
  is not without a providential purpose that the Apostle, Doctor of the Nations,
  expresses the wish that only human temptations should occur to us; because
  divine temptation can become mortal. It was because of this temptation that
  the Jews who lived under the law of God were victims of the bites of snakes.
  This is why the Apostle tells us: "Do not be surprised by a divine
  temptation, but simply be human." A man is said to be subject to divine
  temptation, while acting in the name of God. from God, he hopes for his
  salvation from idols, because he does not hold God to the test. For all that
  is not tried is tempted, and what is tempted becomes doubtful. This is why
  divine temptation is mortal, while human temptation is salutary; for if it is
  dangerous to doubt God, it is even more useful not to put one's hope in man,
  to remain faithful to the law of God. It is therefore in a spirit of high
  wisdom that the Apostle tells us: "Let only human temptations come to
  you.” He wants that when men try our fidelity to the law of God, they find us
  strong and unshakable, and that while the carnal men doubt our fidelity, we
  pass as tested in the eyes of God, because those who are not tested before
  him, he tempts them to make them better. There is therefore a double
  temptation, we are tempted sometimes as faithful, sometimes as if overcome by
  defiance. The temptation of the faithful is a human temptation. For we are
  then tested by men for the cause of faith; they tempt us to make us renounce
  the faith. The temptations caused by defiance are meant to bring men back
  into the way of God through suffering and repentance, as happened to the
  Jews. They no longer had trust in God's providence, they were tempted by
  snakes, so that suffering inspired them with more just feelings. There is
  another temptation to which Abraham, Job, and Tobias, these great servants of
  God, have been subjected: Abraham, by the sacrifice which must have been so
  painful to him of his only and beloved son, reaped abundant fruits of justice
  for eternal glory (Gen. 22:1); Job saw the success of the loss of all his
  goods much greater riches for the earth and for heaven (Job 1-2); lastly, the
  loss of sight was so advantageous to Tobias, that it was followed by a
  glorious cure for him on earth, with the hope of eternal brightness for the
  future life. (Tobit 2:11) The righteous are therefore tested only for their
  advancement. This is why we must show in the temptations of great courage, in
  the conviction that we are far from doing harm they can only be useful if we
  support them patiently with the grace of Jesus Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  THEY MUST BE DISCERNED, AND HE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE HERE. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— Any question requires to be
  well informed to be brought back to its principle. The Apostle complaining of
  the infidelity of the Jews, who had tempted God in solitude, said to the
  faithful of Corinth, "Let us not tempt Jesus Christ, as some of them
  tempted.” (1 Corinthians 10:9) He reminds them of the infidelity of the Jews
  and the punishments with which they were followed, to inspire them with a
  salutary fear, and to turn us away by this example of their perversity, of
  the divine temptation which he has shown us and to urge to flee above all
  else. There is divine temptation when a man living under the law of God does
  not leave in a feeling of defiance to ask for help from idols. He therefore
  urges us to let ourselves be surprised only by human temptations. Now, a
  human temptation is that which inspires us with the defiance of man for the
  cause of God, and makes us eagerly welcome the inspirations of faith. This
  temptation is a defiance that prevents us from defying ourselves from the
  promises of God. This temptation belongs to mankind, because in every error
  that seduces us there is a human temptation that declares itself against the
  law of God by opposing it with worldly reasons, and wants us to lose
  confidence in God's promises. So you see clearly what God's temptation and
  human temptation are to be kept from neglecting if we are engaged in the
  faith of God.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

It is not according to persons that we must judge the truth or the falsity of
an assertion. All that is in conformity with the good and the truth is said
without doubt by the Holy Spirit. That a man is reprehensible on other points
is not a reason to refuse to believe him when he speaks the truth. It is not
him when we refuse to believe, but our Lord Jesus Christ is contradicted. By
arguing that he does not speak the truth, it is Jesus Christ who is insulted.
If, indeed, this man speaks the truth, and it is denied that he has said by the
Holy Spirit that truth which Jesus Christ approves (for no good man can condemn
him who says of him what is true, and it is not by revelation that we learn
what tradition teaches us), no one can be condemned by telling the truth.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is this great number of those who must believe that the Apostle calls all men.
"He is dead for all," he says, "that is, for those who believe

  TO RECONCILE THESE WORDS OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH SPEAKING OF CHRIST: "HE
  DID NOT COMMIT SIN," (ISAIAH 53:9) WITH THESE OTHERS OF THE APOSTLE:
  "HE WAS MADE SIN FOR US WHO KNEW NO SIN?” (2 COR. 5:21) </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— As to meaning, there are two
  different questions here; but the expressions which appear similar are partly
  similar, partly different; he did, and he did not do so are two contradictory
  terms; he did not know and he did not do so are two similar phrases. The
  Prophet, speaking of the person of Christ, therefore says that he has not
  committed sin, and that lies have not been found on his lips. The Apostle, on
  the other hand, speaks of the person of the Father who made sin for us Christ
  who did not know sin. What to hear in two ways. First he made sin when he resolved
  his incarnation and decreed that he who was not subject to this condition
  would take a body of sinful flesh, and thus it was sinned. He made it sin
  again by offering it for our sins, for the victim offered under the law for
  sins took the name of sin. Jesus Christ, therefore, did not know sin, as the
  Prophet declares, but his Father has made him sin, as we have shown. To offer
  Christ for us, is it not to give all power to those who want to put him to
  death? Now, why was this power granted to them, it is in our interest, so
  that Christ could descend to hell and strip it of the souls it held captive.
  It is an enormous sin, unheard of, to have put to death the one who not only
  was guilty of no sin, but who had restored life to so many; it is from this
  sin that the devil has been guilty, and he has thereby lost his power of
  proud opposition. We read something similar in the Galatian epistle: "It
  was made for us curse," says St. Paul. (Gal. 3:13) Now who made him a
  curse, if not the Father? For it is by an effect of God's judgment that the
  cross of Jesus Christ is the curse of the Jews, and the death of the Savior
  highly proclaims their sin. He therefore wanted to be crucified, so that his
  passion might be useful to us, and that those who would come out of this life
  with the sign of the Savior would be free from the tyranny of the second
  death; for death dreads even the servants of him who triumphed over it. In
  this question not only the words, but the people are different. He did and he
  did not do it are two contradictory terms; but as the action claimed to have
  been made has not been done by the person who has been denied, it cannot be
  said that there is a contradiction. The words of the prophet apply to the
  person of Christ, those of the Apostle to the person of the Father. In fact,
  God the Father has reconciled the world through Jesus Christ, and this is how
  he has made Christ to be sin. He therefore made him sin, by bringing down
  into the bosom of a virgin to be born man, he who by his nature was not
  subject to a human birth, and thus he was made sin of the side of the flesh
  which is a flesh of sin. He was born to be offered as a victim for fishermen.
  Thus the Apostle says that he was made sin, because according to the law the
  victim who was offered for sins took the name of sin. We read something
  similar in the epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians. He says in speaking of
  the Savior, "He was made a curse for us," (Gal. 3:13) which words
  here are the meaning: God the Father did it for us, sin or curse, allowing
  the Jews to put Him to death, so that their unbelief, because of their
  disapproval, gives us place to take their place according to what the Savior
  said: "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and it will be
  given to a people who will bear the fruits.” (Matt. 21:43) In the language of
  Scripture God is supposed to do what he allows, because something is done
  only because he allows it. So our Lord said to Pilate, "You shall have
  no power over me, unless it be given you from above.” (Jn. 19:11) It is not
  by sending it from heaven, but by allowing the use of power that God gives
  it, and the perverse soul that receives the power to do what it wants becomes
  guilty, like the Jews who by putting to death the Savior made him their
  curse, by a just judgment of God. Indeed, the Savior's cross was the curse of
  the Jews. The sacrilege that was offered on the cross did not purify the one
  who offered it as the victim sacrificed for sins; on the contrary, the Savior
  in this sacrifice has become the sin that defiles the soul of those who
  offered it, and the justification of those who lived far from him, so that
  the blessing promised to Abraham may be repaired among the nations. Indeed
  the sacrifice of the Jews benefited the Gentiles, who did not hesitate to
  embrace the faith of Jesus Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  power of proud opposition. We read something similar in the Galatian epistle:
  "It was made for us curse," says St. Paul. (Gal. 3:13) Now who made
  him a curse, if not the Father? For it is by an effect of God's judgment that
  the cross of Jesus Christ is the curse of the Jews, and the death of the
  Savior highly proclaims their sin. He therefore wanted to be crucified, so
  that his passion might be useful to us, and that those who would come out of
  this life with the sign of the Savior would be free from the tyranny of the
  second death; for death dreads even the servants of him who triumphed over it.
  In this question not only the words, but the people are different. He did and
  he did not do it are two contradictory terms; but as the action claimed to
  have been made has not been done by the person who has been denied, it cannot
  be said that there is a contradiction. The words of the prophet apply to the
  person of Christ, those of the Apostle to the person of the Father. In fact,
  God the Father has reconciled the world through Jesus Christ, and this is how
  he has made Christ to be sin. He therefore made him sin, by bringing down
  into the bosom of a virgin to be born man, he who by his nature was not
  subject to a human birth, and thus he was made sin of the side of the flesh
  which is a flesh of sin. He was born to be offered as a victim for fishermen.
  Thus the Apostle says that he was made sin, because according to the law the
  victim who was offered for sins took the name of sin. We read something
  similar in the epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians. He says in speaking of
  the Savior, "He was made a curse for us," (Gal. 3:13) which words
  here are the meaning: God the Father did it for us, sin or curse, allowing
  the Jews to put Him to death, so that their unbelief, because of their
  disapproval, gives us place to take their place according to what the Savior
  said: "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and it will be
  given to a people who will bear the fruits.” (Matt. 21:43) In the language of
  Scripture God is supposed to do what he allows, because something is done
  only because he allows it. So our Lord said to Pilate, "You shall have
  no power over me, unless it be given you from above.” (Jn. 19:11) It is not
  by sending it from heaven, but by allowing the use of power that God gives
  it, and the perverse soul that receives the power to do what it wants becomes
  guilty, like the Jews who by putting to death the Savior made him their
  curse, by a just judgment of God. Indeed, the Savior's cross was the curse of
  the Jews. The sacrilege that was offered on the cross did not purify the one
  who offered it as the victim sacrificed for sins; on the contrary, the Savior
  in this sacrifice has become the sin that defiles the soul of those who
  offered it, and the justification of those who lived far from him, so that
  the blessing promised to Abraham may be repaired among the nations. Indeed
  the sacrifice of the Jews benefited the Gentiles, who did not hesitate to
  embrace the faith of Jesus Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

UP PETER HIS COLLEAGUE IN THE APOSTOLATE THAT, OUT OF FEAR OF THE CIRCUMCISED
JEWS, HE WAS SEPARATING FROM THE GENTILES, WHILE HE HIMSELF, OUT OF FEAR ALSO
OF THOSE WHO WERE CIRCUMCISED, THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO CIRCUMCISE TIMOTHY, AGAINST
THE DEFENSE HE HIMSELF MADE TO RECEIVE. CIRCUMCISION? HE IS THEREFORE
REPREHENSIBLE. (ACTS 16:3) </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
It is quite incredible that such a great apostle has taken in another a fault
to which he would have succumbed himself. It is not allowed to believe that
such a great man has fallen into a contradiction which is proper only to those
who live according to the flesh. The action of the Apostle St. Paul is
therefore nothing reprehensible. He taught, it is true, that one should not be
circumcised, but as he wanted to take with him Timothy who was born of a Jewish
mother and a kind father, and that the Jews were scandalized that he would add
a man born of a Jewish mother without being circumcised, he submitted for the
moment to this observance and circumcised Timothy. So he did something useless
with the consent of that he who was the object. As his mother was Jewish, and
from his childhood he had applied himself in the synagogue to the study of the
holy letters, that is to say the books of the Hebrews, he consented to be
circumcised to remove any occasion of scandal to the Jews who were zealous for
all that was due to the privileges of their race. "As for Titus, who was
kind, he was not obliged, he said, to be circumcised. But for Timothy, who was
born of a Jewish mother, as I have said, the Jews would not suffer that he
should rank among the doctors without being circumcised. The Apostle had taken
him with him to give him episcopal consecration, which he did indeed. His
profound knowledge of prophecies gave him the means to preach Jesus Christ
fruitfully. Now the Apostle St. Peter would not have been taken back, if
according to the custom of the Jews he had simply separated from the Gentiles
not to scandalize the Jews. Now, what the Apostle St. Paul assumes in him, is
that in the presence of the Gentiles converted to the faith he ate with them
and like them, whereas after the arrival of the Jews whom St. James had sent he
feared the circumcised, and taught that Gentiles converted to the faith should
Judaize. This is St. Paul's reproach: "If you are Jewish, live like the
Gentiles; why are you compelling the Gentiles to Judaize?" This led to the
questioning of the Gospel doctrine, which was an evil, since it erected with
one hand and destroyed the other. The apostle Saint Paul calls a dissimulation,
and if he thought it his duty to circumcise Timothy, he made known that he
submitted to a useless observance not to scandalize the Jews, and that he
yielded to them because Timothy had a Jewish mother, because it was the only
motive of the Jewish authorities, for they could in no way condemn that
Gentiles do not circumcise or be scandalized by this abstaining on the part of
those which was not of the race of Israel, but not by dissimulation, but by
yielding to force, that St. Paul acted in this circumstance. On the contrary,
Peter's conduct was an act of concealment in the first place, because a large
number surrendered guilty of this suppression, and several Jews, and Barnabas
himself allowed themselves to be carried away.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  APOSTLE, SAYS, "WE ARE THE JEWS OF OUR BIRTH," WANTS TO SHOW THAT
  THE JEWS DERIVE THEIR BIRTH FROM THE JEWS, AND I DO NOT SPEAK HERE OF THE PROSELYTES
  WHO BECOME JEWS. SO THOSE BORN IN THE DESERT WERE NOT CIRCUMCISED, YET THEY
  WERE JEWS. IT IS NOT CIRCUMCISION THAT MAKES THE JEW, BUT THE BIRTH OF
  PARENTS FAITHFUL TO THE RELIGION OF A CREATOR GOD. IF, THEN, JEWS ARE BORN OF
  THE JEWS, WHY ARE NOT CHRISTIANS ALSO BORN OF CHRISTIANS, JUST AS PAGANS ARE
  BORN PAGANS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
  All that is born is not of the same nature as that which gives birth to it.
  Thus gold is born from the earth without being earth itself, so is the food
  that comes from the wood, the little bird that is born from the egg. Now, if
  Gentiles are born of the Gentiles, here is the reason: every pagan is in
  ignorance, and he who is born having no true idea, both are ignorant. There
  is, however, this difference between them, that the one who gives birth is
  undoubtedly a blasphemer, and thereby even a child of the devil; while the
  child who has just been born can neither blaspheme nor bless, yet he is pagan
  because he has no understanding of the truth. The Jew is born of a Jew
  because he owes the day to his parents who are faithful to the worship of the
  Creator God. This is what Adam said at the birth of Cain: "I have
  begotten a man by the grace of God.” (Gen. 4:1) Just as pagans without
  religion for the Creator give thanks to the devil in all the events of their
  lives, so the Jews who worship the Creator God praise Him in all their deeds,
  they are blameworthy only not to recognize Christ by whom all things exist.
  (Jn. 1:3) The Jew is born of Jewish parents in this way. It is not, as some
  think, that circumcision is the Jew. Circumcision is the sign of Judaism and
  not Judaism, just as the circumcision of Abraham was not justice for him, but
  the sign of righteousness, so that those who were born of Abraham would bear
  the characteristic sign as children of Abraham. It is from Judas Maccabee
  that the Jews derive their name, and not only the inhabitants of the tribe of
  Judah, but all the other children of Jacob are called Jews (Judæi) because
  Judas was their leader; and that is why the Jews receive at their birth a
  sign which makes them recognize. For the Christian, on the contrary, he is
  not born of a Christian, because whoever gives him birth is not born, but has
  become a Christian. He who is born of him must also become if he wants to be;
  for he is not born Christian by virtue of his nature, he becomes so by the
  faith which is given him after his birth. Ignorance is the companion of
  carnal birth, the spiritual gift of faith is given only afterwards. But this
  is what is objected to: If the one who begets has become a Christian, he must
  transmit through the generation what he is to perpetuate the dignity with
  which he is clothed. That is how senators give birth to senators. I answer
  that the dignity of senator is without merit in the eyes of God. It is not to
  nature, that is, to the substance of man, that this dignity is attached, it
  is entirely in the fame and appreciation of men. This appreciation is
  transmitted by the generation, but the dignity it gives exists only in public
  opinion, so that the consuls, or those to whom statues are raised, put their
  joy in vanity. But when one becomes a Christian, nature itself is clothed
  with this dignity, the essence of man enters into the participation of the
  eternal benefit of incompatibility; it is not here a mere presumption, it is
  an actual reality in the eyes of God. The first are like an eloquent but poor
  man, who is lauded with praise and lacks bread or other things necessary for
  life. The dignity really worthy of praise is that which shelters from all
  need the one who is clothed with it, who is independent by nature and needs
  no help, no support; such is true wealth and true glory. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  as that which gives birth to it. So gold, etc. There is, however, the pagan
  who is without intelligence, and who has no merit either by himself or by
  another. Now the Jew is born of a Jew, and so on. But this is what is
  objected to: If the one who begets has become what he is, he must engender a
  being like himself, in order to ensure the transmission of the dignity with
  which he is clothed, as he has done for the Jews; for Abraham, idolatrous as
  he was, became a servant of the true God, and it is from him that the Jews
  have their origin, just as those who become senators in turn create senators.
  But the dignity of the senators has no merit in the eyes of God, this dignity
  is attached neither to nature nor to substance, it consists entirely in the
  fame and appreciation of men, and this appreciation is transmitted. by the
  generation, but the dignity it gives exists only in opinion. We said why Jews
  are born Jews. As for the Christian, his nature, his substance, his whole
  being, participate in the dignity he receives, it is not only a mere
  presumption, it is an actual reality before God. Let us add that by the
  remission of sins man is completely purified and becomes the adopted son of
  God. It is therefore necessary that all who are born be subject to this
  second birth, because the mercy of God gives each one grace. One cannot
  receive for others the remission of sins. The soul that is born in the body
  or with the body, subject to the death of which Adam was the cause, cannot
  avoid the torment of hell if it bears the sign of the victory it has won over
  death. Everyone receives this benefit for himself, and not for him who does
  not yet exist. If the one who becomes a Christian immediately came into
  possession of immortality, the child born of him would be like the one who
  gives him birth. Those who become Christians, receive the sign that frees
  them from the second death, yet they cannot escape the present death,
  following the sin of Adam. Now, children are baptized, innocent as they are,
  so that their soul without experience who is born with the body bears the
  sign of his victory over death, who loses his rights over it. Abraham and the
  prophets have no sign, because the time has not yet arrived; it was reserved
  for the Son of God who came to triumph over death to spread this grace in the
  souls of believers. This is why Our Lord said to the Jews: "Abraham,
  your father, desired to see my day, he saw it, and rejoiced in it.” Abraham
  knew, indeed, that Christ had been promised him as the liberator of the human
  race; and as it was absolutely necessary that those who were in limbo waited
  for his arrival, Abraham shuddered with joy when he saw in the spirit the
  birth of Christ, in the certainty that he would soon come out of this place
  of waiting to enter heaven. How, then, could Christians be born of
  Christians, since faith and baptism are two necessary conditions for being a
  Christian?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

FULFILLED THE LAW, SINCE IT IS USELESS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The law given by Moses produced
justice, it is true, but a worldly justice, a temporary justice for those who
observed it, and who discharged them simply of guilt, for the just according to
the law is the one that does not do wrong to no one. Which makes the Apostle
say: "The law is not according to faith, but he who observes these
precepts will find life there" (Gal. 3:12), that is to say, he who
fulfills the law will not die, he will live by the present life. Justice, on
the contrary, which comes from faith, justifies men before God and makes them
worthy of the rewards of the future time. For it is right, indeed, to know who
and by whom we are, so that the true confession of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit may lead us to the kingdom of heaven. The elders themselves who, in
observance of the precepts of the law, have joined the love of God with the
hope of promises, have been justified before God. It is the law alone which
according to the doctrine of the Apostle cannot make men just before God, just
as faith alone to the exclusion of works is not sufficient to render them
pleasing to God; to render men perfect, the justice of the earth must be joined
to divine justice. This is what the Savior teaches us when He says, "If
your righteousness is no more abundant than that of the scribes and Pharisees,
you will not enter the kingdom of heaven." (Matt. 5:20)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

believe in Jesus Christ, they still wanted to keep the law, as if one did not
place all his hope in Jesus Christ. It is these Christians whom the Apostle
calls false brothers. (Gal. 2:4, 2 Cor. 11:26) Thus, after the teaching given
by the apostles, they had corrupted the spirit of the Galatians and wanted to
make them Jews under the name of the Savior. This is why the Apostle says that
Christ came to be the mediator of circumcision and uncircumcision: "To
form in himself one new man and to bring peace between the two peoples,"
he writes to the Ephesians. (Eph. 2:15) If therefore Jesus came as a mediator,
and the office of the mediator is to bring peace between the two parties, and
to draw a new rule by stripping them both of their way of seeing, Our Lord
reconciles them so that they attach themselves exclusively to his feeling and
thus renounce all the causes of their old discords. On one side the Jew
supports circumcision, on the other the good man claims that one should not be
circumcised, and opposition reigns between them. Take away this principle of
discord, and peace is reborn immediately. Now, if it be so, says St. Paul, why
do you, Galatians who make you Jews, want to destroy the office of mediator of
Jesus Christ? This is why he says to them, "You are strangers to Jesus
Christ.” They despise the principle of reconciliation which he had established
between the two peoples, and they return to the old ideas of the Jews,
condemning themselves by the same as well as the one who reconciled them, for
all that displeases is by the same accused and sentenced. And as the reason
that brought back the Galatians to the observance of the law, was that they
believed in one God, but without any mystery, and that they regarded as
contrary to the law of recognizing the divinity of Christ. The Apostle says to
them, "A mediator is not one, but two. For you, on the contrary, who
return to the law, you refuse the mediator; however, God is one.” The Apostle,
in thus establishing the divinity of Jesus Christ, does not wish to make a God
other than the one who exists, nor to teach that there are two Gods; God is one,
he tells them, as it is written in the law. When we teach, in effect, that Jesus
Christ is God from God, we do not claim to authorize belief in another God, for
what is of God does not suffer to be called another God. Whether we consider
God or what is God, it is always one God. There is no difference between God
and what is of God. It is another himself; it is another because of the
distinct person who is called the Son; it is the same because of the unity of
substance. Let it not be wrong that I here employ the name of a person whom
some believe must reject; Let us follow the example of the Apostle who says to
the Corinthians, “If I gave anything, I gave it because of you, in the person
of Jesus Christ.” (2 Cor. 2:10)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  circumcision and other similar prescriptions which are primitive and carnal,

  these prescriptions were of divine institution, they were part of the worship

  DOUBT THE PAGANS WERE ENSLAVED TO THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD. WHAT, THEN, ARE
  THESE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE: "WE WERE OURSELVES UNDER THE ELEMENTS OF

  PAGANS DIFFERENT? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
  The pagans are not only subjugated under the elements, but enslaved to the
  elements themselves, for they adore in the firmament the stars, the sun, the
  moon, the luminaries; in the lower world, the earth, the water; in the sea,
  Neptune; in the underworld, Pluto; in a word, everything is God for them in
  creation, with the exception of the Creator. The Jews were also under the
  elements; but yet they served God who was the author of these institutions.
  They observed new moons, sabbaths, sacrifices of animals. At the beginning of
  the seventh month they sounded the trumpet, and on the fifteenth day of that
  month they took the fruits of the most beautiful tree, the branches of the palm
  trees, the branches of the most tender trees, the branches of the willows,
  and they lived seven days under tents formed of these branches of the tree.
  (Lev. 23:40) In observing these prescriptions, the Jews were under the
  elements in a true sense, because they have for their object the elements.
  Christians, on the contrary, by serving God, not under the elements, but
  rising above the elements, and hastening to arrive at the heavenly Jerusalem
  worship God in spirit, not with the help of external things and visible, but
  by an inner worship, and rendering homage invisible to the invisible God,
  following the Lord's recommendation in his Gospel: "The hour is coming
  when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.” (Jn.
  4:23) So the truth is to serve God in spirit, and worship him where the
  spirit has more share than the body, because God is spirit. In one respect
  the Jews were thus subjugated under the elements, as I have recalled; but, on
  the other hand, the end of their law was wholly spiritual; it forbade them to
  sin, commanded them to love God with all their heart and to put their hope in
  Jesus Christ. Now, while the apostles preached to them all these spiritual
  duties, the Jews defended the elementary and carnal institutions. St. Paul recalls
  this memory to confound the Jews who remained enslaved to visible observances,
  and despised the spiritual part of the law. The Apostle therefore wants to
  show them the weakness and powerlessness of these practices compared to the
  law of faith, and he does so by intervening personally in the debate, he who
  was once a zealous zealot of these observances. But as soon as he had known
  Jesus Christ, he would have nothing but contempt for these practices, for the
  grace of God given to us by Jesus Christ differs immensely from the law of
  works.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THAT HE REPROVES AND CONDEMNS IN ALL THIS EPISTLE: "BE LIKE ME, SINCE I AM

LIKE ME. PERHAPS HE HAD IMITATED THEM IN SOMETHING, AND THAT HE WANTED THEM TO
BE SIMILAR IN OTHER RESPECTS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
What could the Apostle imitate in them, or what could he fail the doctor of the
nations? He therefore exhorts the Galatians to be his imitators, and he refutes
the impossibility that they could object by saying to them: I am what you are,
for you are men as I am; do what I do. These words may be related to what he
said was done to everyone by sharing their ideas when they were true to the
truth, especially those of the Gentiles. (1 Cor. 9:22) There were among the
Jews institutions that should no longer be observed, but whose observance was
once legitimate, such as circumcision, Sabbath observance, new moons, the
distinction of food. But he shows that the truths which he thought he ought to
approve among the Gentiles never cease to be obligatory. So they think that the
world is the work of God and of men, it is the one thing that always remains.
If, therefore, he associates himself here with their feelings, he urges them to
become equally like him, that is, to believe what he believes himself.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WILL AND OF OUR CHOICE, SINCE THE APOSTLE SAYS: "THE FLESH HAS DESIRES
CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE SPIRIT, AND THE SPIRIT IS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE
FLESH, AND THEY ARE OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER, SO THAT YOU DO NOT DO ALL THE
THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE?" IF THE FLESH HAS DESIRES CONTRARY TO THOSE OF
THE SPIRIT, THEN IT IS BAD, BECAUSE THE SPIRIT ONLY SUGGEST GOOD THINGS. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— Here it is meant by the flesh not
the very substance of the flesh, but the evil deeds and wickedness that are
signified by the flesh. As every error has its source in external and visible
things, and the flesh is in contact with them, since it is a compound of the
elements of this world, the Apostle gives the name of flesh to all error. It is
not only adultery, fornication, impurity that he places among the works of the
flesh, but idolatry, malice, blasphemy, and other similar crimes. Does the
flesh call for blasphemy or idolatry? Is it not the vices of the soul that
consents to error? Yet he is right in saying to those who do good: You are no
longer in the flesh, but in the spirit. And yet they are still in the body. He,
therefore, who walks in the path of virtue and who does not reject the hope of
the faithful, though he lives still in the flesh, is no longer in the flesh.
He, on the contrary, who does evil and opens his lips to blasphemy; the Apostle
says that he is in the flesh and that he is flesh; for just as good men are
spiritual, yet united with the flesh, those who engage in evil are carnal
despite their union with the soul. Here is the explanation of the words of the
Apostle. This error, which he calls the flesh, covets against the spirit, that
is to say it suggests guilty desires against that same spirit which is the law
of God. Indeed, he wants to clearly point to two laws here: the law of God and
the law of the devil. He uses the name of spirit, because the law of God is
spiritual to fight against the flesh, that is to say against the vices to keep
man to God. On the contrary, the law of the devil, which is the error, is in
struggle against the spirit by the seductions of sensuality and the false
sweets of the world. In the midst of these two opposite laws is man; does he
wish to consent to the inspirations of the spirit, the flesh does not want it;
he lends a helping hand to the flesh, he despises the spirit, that is to say
the law of God. Is he about to surrender to the solicitations of the flesh, the
spirit holds him back so that he does not do what he wants; does he wish to
follow the inspirations of the spirit, the flesh urges him not to do what he
thinks is useful; but the spirit opposes to the flesh a just and wise
resistance, and seeks to snatch the man from the counsels of Satan. But the
flesh, that is to say, the opposite law, uses its solicitations, resists the
spirit of the law only to deceive by its ploys. The Apostle, in establishing
the reign of these two laws, has for design to show to free will which side he
should incline his will. He does not want to destroy free will, but to teach
him the choice he has to make. If man had not the free use of his will, neither
the law of the devil, which is the flesh, nor the law of God, which is the
spirit, would be in conflict with one another, in soliciting the man to follow
their inspirations, because to solicit is to persuade. But he who persuades
does not do violence, he tries to dodge himself, and he who gives in to his
suggestions sees his will changing under the influence of these deceptive
counsels. Now, if free will did not exist, the man would be driven in spite of
himself to do what he does not want.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

GALATIANS: I AM ASTONISHED THAT YOU WOULD SOON LEAVE THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU TO
THE GRACE OF JESUS CHRIST TO PASS TO ANOTHER GOSPEL, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO OTHER
GOSPEL? IF IT IS ANOTHER, IT IS NOT THE SAME; IF HE IS NOT THE SAME, HOW IS HE
NOT ANOTHER? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— The
Apostle calls another Gospel the one that was preached to the Galatians,
because it was different from the one they later began to follow. They had let
themselves be diverted from the Gospel of Jesus Christ and into Judaism under
the very name of Jesus Christ as if it were absolutely necessary to embrace it,
and they taught principles quite different from the doctrine of the Apostle.
That is why he adds: “As they seek to persuade you." Indeed, the false
apostles, to more easily deceive the Gentiles who embraced the faith, presented
to them as the doctrine of the Savior their own inventions, as we see in the
Acts of the Apostles: "If you are circumcised according to the law of
Moses, you cannot be saved." (Acts 15:1) Also a great pain takes hold of
the soul of the Apostle at the sight of the perversion of the Galatians and he
says to them, "I am astonished that you should leave the person who called
you to the grace of Jesus Christ to move on to another gospel, even though
there was none else." He is astonished, therefore, that, having borne a
light burden, and much less heavy, they were willing to undertake hard and
painful obligations, that is to say, instead of the simple doctrine of the
faith, they endeavored to be circumcised, to observe the new moons, the
Sabbath, by once again subjecting himself to the elements, and so as not to
appear to furnish to the false apostles the pretext of saying that the doctrine
which the Apostles received was not in accordance with the tradition of truth,
he immediately adds: "Not that he disturbs him among you, and who wishes
to change the gospel of Jesus Christ.” The Gospel to which the Apostle had
called them was therefore different from that which they had begun to follow
under the influence of the false apostles. However, there was no other gospel
than that which Jesus Christ had taught, and that alone was enough to convince
them that they had been misled and bring them back to the only doctrine of
faith, confessing that Jesus Christ God is the only principle of salvation, and
it is through him and not by law that they have received the remission of their
sins that the grace of God forgives under the law.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM ARE HIDDEN IN JESUS CHRIST," HOW CAN THE SAME SAVIOR
SAY THAT HE KNOWS NEITHER THE DAY NOR THE HOUR OF THE FUTURE JUDGMENT? (MARK
13:32) IF HE KNOWS IT AND SAYS HE DOES NOT KNOW IT, IS IT NOT A LIE? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— These words contain a twofold
meaning. The Apostle first wants to say that all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge are hidden in Jesus Christ, in the sense that he who has Jesus
Christ, Jesus Christ, takes his place from all wisdom and all knowledge. That
is to say, that to know Jesus Christ is to know everything, and to understand
all wisdom, as St. Paul says to the Colossians: "Beware lest any man
deceive you by philosophy and by vain subtleties according to the principles of
a worldly knowledge and not according to Jesus Christ, for all the fullness of
divinity dwells in him bodily. (Col. 2:8) That is to say, he who believes in
Jesus Christ far from wanting nothing for salvation, has all in abundance,
because his faith is for the fullness of the deity. He adds again in the same
Epistle: "Let no one deceive you by pretending to be humble, by a
superstitious worship of angels, by taking pride in what he sees, vainly
inflated by his carnal prudence, and not a chief whose whole body, supported by
his bonds and his joints, maintains and grows with the growth of God. (Ibid.
18, 19) If, therefore, believing in Jesus Christ, Christians worship him as the
head of all principality and power, they need no other thing, they have all
that is necessary to be saved, and ignorance of things useless to salvation
will be of no danger to them, because they know what is necessary. We can
therefore say of those Christians who know what is useful to the saint, that
they know all things. These words still signify that all the treasures of
knowledge and wisdom are hidden in the Savior. All the secrets of the Father
are known to him, he measures the extent of all creatures; the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son (Jn. 5:22); and no one knows what
is in God except the Spirit of God who is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. (1
Cor. 2:11) How then can one say that he knows neither the day nor the hour, he
whose spirit knows what is in God, and of whom he has said that he has received
what is his? (Jn. 16:14-15) Now if the one who has received from his own knows
the future things, how can this knowledge be denied to Christ who sent the Holy
Spirit? Can we assume that the Judge who predicted us all the warning signs of
this judgment, ignores the day? It may also be said that he does not know those
to whom he has said: “Truly I say to you, I do not know you." (Matt.
25:12) He will probably not know the foolish and careless virgins, because at
this request: "Lord, Lord, open to us," he answers them, "I tell
you, verily, I do not know you." So there is a reason He tells us that he
does not know what he knows, and in another place he makes this recommendation:
"Watch, because you do not know what time your master is coming."
(Ibid. 24:42) It is therefore to excite our attentiveness and our vigilance
that to the question that is made to him, he answers that he knows neither the
day nor the time of the judgment to come, but it is in our interest that he
says he does not know what he knows. We do not know what is useful to us, and
we want to know things whose knowledge can only be harmful to us. Now, Jesus
Christ, who desires our salvation above all else, declares that he does not

HAVING HEALED ALL THE SICK WHO WERE PRESENTED TO THEM, HAVE NOT CURED THE
DISEASES OF THEIR OWN DISCIPLES? FOR, AFTER ALL, EPAPHRODITUS WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN SICK UNTO DEATH IF THE PRAYERS OF THE APOSTLE HAD BEEN ANSWERED. WHO CAN
DOUBT, INDEED, THAT THE APOSTLE HAS OFTEN ASKED GOD FOR HIS CURE WITHOUT BEING
ABLE TO OBTAIN IT? FOR IF GOD HAD ANSWERED IT, THIS AILMENT WOULD HAVE
DISAPPEARED AT ONCE. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
The Apostles did wonders and miracles to bring the faithful to the faith. At
the sight of these brilliant facts, which it was impossible for men to do, they
recognized the voice of God in the preaching of the Apostles, and these
miracles were for them a demonstration of the high wisdom of the faith. Words
are always subject to contradiction, acts of power come to serve them as
witnesses, and failing them, to prove the high reason of faith that words are
powerless to express. For the faithful, on the contrary, miracles and wonders
are not necessary, but a firm hope. As soon as he is convinced of the truth of
the promises, the spirit is made a weapon of this conviction to arrive by
contempt of the enjoyments present to make himself worthy of eternal goods, and
to increase his merits by his work, following this recommendation of Solomon:
"My son, while approaching the service of God, abide in righteousness and
fear, and prepare your soul for temptation. (Eccl. 2:1) This recommendation is
based on the usefulness of trials for man. This is what makes the Apostle also
say: "It is through many tribulations that we must enter the kingdom of
God." (Acts 14:21) These temptations that arise from trials come to us in
different ways, so that the soul that in the midst of these tribulations
perseveres in the faith that it has received, may obtain the crown. Now it is
not only on faith that man is tempted, but by illness, by loss, by
persecutions, by the death of those dear to him; and if in the midst of these
various trials he does not let himself be carried away to implore the help of
demons, he obtains in the outpouring of his blood the glory of martyrdom. If,
therefore, the Apostle did not obtain what he asked, it was not an evil but a
good thing for Epaphroditus; It was thus that the Apostle, having prayed to God
to deliver him from a personal ailment, received this answer: "My grace is
sufficient for you, for virtue is perfected in infirmity.” (2 Cor. 12:9)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The pain that the Apostle forbids Christians is not that which he would have
felt from the death of Epaphroditus had he come. The reason why this death
would have caused him sadness was that he lost in him an auxiliary, a support
in the preaching of the Gospel. As for us, St. Paul forbids us to grieve, as if
we were crying for lost dead without return and without hope of resurrection.
There is, then, a great difference between the tears caused by the absence of
an auxiliary, of a friend, and the pain produced by the death of a person who
is no longer thought to exist. On one side there is no more consolation
possible, on the other despair alone is excluded.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

common to him with the Father. Because in him no perfection is yet to come, he
has them all eternally. He is born to create and repair all things. Order and

  — All divine Scriptures are bitter for unbelievers and carnal men. Thus, it
  is unpleasant for idolaters to hear one God preaching in Jesus Christ. This
  doctrine captures Photin with horror and fear. Sabellius also blushes to hear
  a Father who cannot be called the Son, because he is the principle of all
  things, and a Son who is called Son, because he is not the Father, but he is
  of the Father, and it is not of him, but by him are all things. Arius is also
  condemned by reading that Jesus Christ is the true Son of God, because he
  could be called his true Son, if he did not come from God in a rigorous
  sense. This doctrine convinces Marcion of a lie by teaching him, who denies
  that Christ has true flesh, that the Word has become flesh. (Jn. 1:14) She
  also accuses the shameless Manichean, showing him in the story of the
  Evangelist, forbidding marriage and preaching a shameful promiscuity, that
  the Savior not only honored the marriage of his presence, but provided the
  spouses with the wine they needed. (Jn. 2:1-11) These are the truths
  contained in the book that the Apostle received to devour. This book is the
  gospel according to St. John, that is, bitter not only for those who
  interpret it sinfully, but for wild and unrestrained minds who do not want to
  change their lives and sink deeper into evil. Now, this revelation took place
  at the time that the Apostle St. John was on the island of Patmos where the
  Emperor Domitian had exiled him for the cause of faith. He was then delighted
  in the spirit to be able to contemplate the mysteries of heaven, and while
  God revealed to him the shocks he reserved for ungodliness, adultery, and
  other crimes, he was given a book which was sweet to the mouth, but bitter in
  the bowels; that is to say, among the Christians who appear to be one body,
  he must be gentle to those who are shown by the mouth, because of their holy
  and irreproachable life, for a thing is not sweet in the mouth only when it
  is one and without mixing; but it must be bitter to those whom the depravity
  of heresy renders carnal in their actions as well as in their feelings, and
  which are shown by the insides, for this book will be their accuser in the
  day of the judgment of God. As a result of this revelation, God gives him the
  order to write his Gospel for the reasons we have said. The prophet Ezekiel
  was also ordered to take a book that was sweet to his mouth, when he sent it
  to reproach the people for their infidelity. (Ezek. 3:1) It often happens
  that in seeking to abbreviate, one falls into error. Why do not you expose
  all the elements of a question, and remove some of it to make the meaning
  more obscure? So John was told, "Go, and take this book that is in the
  hand of the angel, and devour it, and it will be sweet in your mouth like
  honey, but it will be bitter in your bowels”; And God adds, "You must
  still prophesy to a great many peoples and nations.” (Rev. 8:9-11) Now, the
  truth is that St. John wrote his Gospel after his exile. He had been exiled
  on the island of Patmos by the Emperor Domitian, and it was there that he had
  a revelation on a Sunday day, as he himself says; and as a result of this
  revelation, he wrote his gospel, which is bitter to the heretics fathomed by
  the bowels, for they are carnal because they make false ideas of Christ. But
  in your mouth, it is said to John, it will be sweet as honey. God makes all
  Christians one body, in which they are the members of one another; the mouth
  which is part of the head, is the figure of the most honorable and most
  faithful for the truth that comes from Jesus Christ is full of sweetness. The
  bowels are heretics because they are carnal. Also, the truth discovers that
  Jesus Christ is true God is bitter to them. Indeed, the Gospel of St. John is
  entirely directed against the heretics. Against Photin, who denies that
  Christ existed before Mary, John proves that the Savior came down from
  heaven. Against Arius, John shows that Christ had no beginning, because in
  the beginning Christ was the Son of God, God Himself in God his Father, and
  as nothing was done without him, it cannot be said that it was done itself,
  for if it had been done, something would have been done without it, but since
  nothing was done without it, it has always existed, who confuses the Father
  with the Son, and makes only one person under two different names, he
  confounds by the words of the Savior: "If you loved me, you would
  rejoice that I go to my Father, because my Father is greater than me." (Jn.
  14:28) He clearly distinguishes two persons here, since the Son declares that
  the Father is greater than himself, and if he is alone, he cannot be more.
  This gospel still condemns Marcion, who denied that Christ was clothed in a
  true flesh, with these words: "The Word became flesh, and he has dwelt
  among us." (Jn. 1:14) He also fights Manichea, who does not know that
  Jesus Christ came into the world. and forbids marriage, in the ignorance of
  where the Savior has deigned to supply what was lacking at a wedding dinner.
  An angel also commanded the prophet Ezekiel to take a book and devour it; it
  must be sweet to his mouth and fill his bowels. (Ezek. 3:1) The Prophet
  received this command when God sent him to take back the infidelity and
  disorders of his people from the bowels because of his carnal life. Of this
  number are those to which the prophet Isaiah gives the name of brothers, in
  spite of their wickedness: "You who fear God, say to those who hate you
  and who have not listened to my precepts, You are our brothers.” (Isa. 56:5)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

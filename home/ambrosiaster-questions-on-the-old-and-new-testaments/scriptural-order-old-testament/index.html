"In the beginning God created heaven and earth.” If God created heaven and
earth in the beginning, and heaven is the firmament, as the sequel shows, it is
not true that light was made first place, and then the firmament; for the
sacred author could not designate another heaven, because he describes the
creation of the world as God made it in its perfection. As men followed
erroneous systems of the creation of the world, Moses, inspired by God, teaches
them the true origin of the world. Some, in fact, pretended that it had not had
a beginning, others that it had had a beginning, but that it had been made by
angels; others also maintained that it had been done, but by a certain Sacla,
who is the god of opposing power. A small number, in the tradition of truth
about the origin of the world, asserted that it had God as his author. It was
to undeceive those who were the victims of these false opinions that Moses was
compelled to make known the true cause of the world, lest the children of
Israel, freed from the tyranny of the Egyptians, should not yet be slaves to
their slaves of false interpretations. Indeed, the Egyptians, among all
peoples, were zealous advocates of error, for centuries they had applied
themselves more than all others to the study of a vain philosophy. Now, Moses,
by the very fact that he had been adopted by the. the daughter of Pharaoh, had
been instructed in all the science of the Egyptians. (Exod. 2:10; Acts
7:22.)<span>  </span></font><font size="3">What do these words signify:
"In the beginning God created heaven and earth?” If by the truth we must
understand what we have said above, let us see what he means. We believe that
Moses, in order to destroy all error on the lower creatures and on the matter
which has served to make the world, first wanted to speak of the substances and
elements which have served to create the world, if had said nothing, one might
have thought that these substances were equal and co-eternal to God. He,
therefore, who believes in the account of the inspired author, cannot doubt
that the world was created, since Moses attests that the substances that served
the creation of the world were created in the beginning. God created heaven and
earth in the beginning, that is, the higher and the lower substance. The higher
substance was the essential material of the sky, the lower substance is a
thicker substance which has served to make the arid element called earth and
darkness. That is why it is said in the prophet Isaiah: "I am the God who
made light and created darkness (Is. 45:7).” When God created these things, he
also titled the material element, that is to say, water, darkness, and earth
before the signs of the times; according to some, is a heap of frozen water, it
is so called, because it is formed by a mass of water; solidified and firmed by
the power of God, and is also given the name of heaven from the verbs </font><i><font size="3">occulendo</font></i><font size="3">, </font><i><font size="3">celanda</font></i><font size="3">, conceal, hide. Water appears first, because it is the
principal element, and it has served to form the vault of the world. The earth
is like the floor, and David testifies that it is the work of the Holy Spirit:
"Let the waters that are above the heavens praise the name of the Lord,
for he says, and all things have been done; he commanded, and all was created
(Ps. 148:4).” After the creation of these elements, and before the organization
of the world, God created light, to spread clarity on his works, and this light,
as a result of God's established rule, provides the space of a day. The night
succeeded the day, according to the same rule, and after the space of time
assigned to it, it was illuminated by the return of the morning light. So the
first day ended with the beginning of the second day, for the night was
gathered in the day, to do with it only one day, because the darkness being
subjected to light have no independent existence and may be numbered. Thirty
days form a lunar month and in these thirty days are included nights. The space
of time during which the light fills the office assigned to it is called day.
The dark element before being lighted is called night, and it is the space of
time which is between the end of the day and the rising of the dawn which bears
the name of night. For it is not the darkness that makes the night, as the
light is made, because the darkness remains what it is by nature. On the
contrary, the return of light is born, and its disappearance at night. It is
therefore not without reason that night is subdued by daylight. After the
creation of light an equal space of twelve hours of day and twelve hours of
night formed what is called the equinox of the first day. From the days begin
to grow on the night for three months which are the spring season. Then they
decline for the next three months, which form the summer season. We arrive
again at the equinox, after which the night becomes longer than the day during
three months which are the autumn months; then it loses in turn its length greater
than that of the day until the end of the fourth season which is winter. Thus
we return to the equinox of the first day in which God created the world, a day
that is believed to be the eleventh of the calends of April, which is the first
day of the Passover, that is to say, the first day of the first month. In fact,
the law ordered the Jews to prepare on the evening of the tenth day of the
first month to celebrate the Passover on the fourteenth day of the same month,
that is, to begin the eleventh. Now the evening of the tenth day is followed by
the dawn of the eleventh, and the eleven of the calends of April is the
beginning of the first month. In the beginning the moon was created in its
fourteenth day, because all things were made in their entirety. Add three days
since the last night, and these are the three days before the stars appeared,
and you find that it was the eleven of the calends of April that the world was
created, because the number of days of the moon descends from the eleventh to
the fourteenth. The first whole month has therefore been assigned for the
celebration of the Passover, so that the day of the celebration is never below
the eleven of the calends of April, or beyond the fourteenth day of the moon,
because it is the eleventh day that the world was made, and on the fourteenth
day of the moon a greater light was created more strikingly. Now, between the
beginning and that glorious splendor which enlightened the world, our Lord
suffered and rose again on the first day called the day of the Lord, because it
was made by the Lord, the author of the months which succeed each other, times
and years. But this Passover feast is not celebrated everywhere in the same
manner, because the course of the moon in its periods of growth and decay is defiantly
calculated. "Now the earth was invisible and unformed (Gen. 1:2).” It is
evident that the earth at the first moment of its creation was invisible and
unformed; it was covered by the waters, so it was invisible, it was unformed,
because being liquid, it was not fit for culture. "And the darkness
covered the face of the abyss.” The sacred writer says that darkness was poured
out on the face of the abyss, that is, on the immense surface of the waters.
"And the spirit of God was carried on the waters. It was as on the upper
part of these waters that the spirit of God was carried, while the darkness
covered the infinite depth of the same waters. The spirit of God was on the
waters because there was no darkness where the spirit of God was, who, as much
as it could, shed light on the waters. But the abyss, that is to say, the
immense depth of the waters, was inaccessible to this light; it illuminated the
higher waters, and below it reigned the darkness spread over the whole face of
the abyss. Moses calls this spirit the spirit of God, and he wants to make us
understand not the Holy Spirit, but a spiritual force that was above the
material creature. As he wishes to teach us that everything comes from God, he
calls the spirit of God the spirit that was carried on the waters, to destroy
that wicked error which causes one to say that God said something that God is
not the author of all that exists. For what comes from God is above all the
powers and all the principalities, as well as above all the spiritual powers.
Let no one be surprised that this spirit is called the spirit of God, when
everything evidently comes from God. For God himself, before punishing the
earth by the flood, said: "My spirit shall not abide in these men, because
they are flesh (Gen. 6:3)." We read also in the prophet Ezekiel,
"This is what the Lord says to me: I will stretch out the skin upon you,
and I will send in you the spirit and you will live (Ez. 38:5).” Is not it
rather the office of the soul than that of the Holy Spirit? Here, then, is the
spirit of God, that is to say, an omnipotent virtue, which governed the
elements of matter, for his office was to direct them. When God had created the
light and regulated the duration of the day, and the second day was over, he
made the firmament, that is to say, heaven, so that light was the rule of the
day in the firmament and that it was like a torch in a house. Now the firmament
was created from the substance of the waters of which we have spoken. The world
passes into the organized state; to the confusion of the elements succeeds the
distinction of substances, and we see the appearance of the more perfect
formations which must be like the members of that great body called the world.
Indeed, the elements that were created in the first place were like the
materials of the world. However, they are called the world, because these
elements have been derived from confusion to produce every kind of creatures
and have thus determined this name of world because they had been used for its
creation. The firmament, that is to say, the sky, was thus established in the
midst of the waters, to separate the waters above the firmament from the
waters. The divine power establishes this firmament in the midst of the waters
which were below it, in it, above it and around it. It was of a concave form,
and sufficiently defenseless by its nature against the invasion of internal or
external waters, it was like a well fortified house, which gives security to
its inhabitants. On the third day God ordered the waters under the sky, that is
to say, in the space formed by the concavity of the firmament to gather
together in a single bond, in order to let appear the arid element which is the
earth, and that is so. The whole extent of the earth having been brought to
dry, it is like a vast reservoir, in which the waters which were under the heat
were precipitated, and the arid element appeared. As the waters had withdrawn,
the hitherto invisible earth had to appear visible. God gave to the arid
element the name of earth, and he called all these waters gathered together. He
then commanded the land to produce plants for food and fruit trees, each
according to its kind on the earth. On the fourth day he created great bodies
of light in the sky to light the earth, the greater one to begin the day, the
lesser to begin the night, and he also placed the stars. These stars are
intended to promote the germination, birth and nourishment of all that occurs
in the world, to serve as signs to mark times divided into determined spaces,
and to be the ornament of the whole world. A house shines by its ornamentation
when the vaults are clad in gilded paneling; thus the stars are the ornament of
the world by their varied light and brilliance. In the light he had created in
the first place, God adds the splendor of the sun, to make of these two beings
only one indivisible whole, he then gives to the dark night a luminous body,
and as the moon was created in his fourteenth day, Moses said, A lesser
luminous body to shine at the beginning of the night, for as soon as it was
created it poured out its light throughout the night. The part is taken for the
whole in these words: "To shine at the beginning of the night,” because
the moon does not always shine in the evening. The greater luminous body which
we call the sun shines from the beginning of the day, because it has been
inseparably united to the light which was created in the first place. The world
was therefore three days without these luminous bodies, for there was still
nothing on earth that required their presence. But when the earth had produced
the plants which were to serve as food, and the fruit trees, the necessity of
the stars, which were to develop or preserve them, were felt. As the
germination and production of plants are subject to the influence of these
stars, they should not be created before the plants, lest any attempt should be
made to attribute to them the creation of all the productions of the earth; the
plants were to precede, inasmuch as their creation seemed entirely independent
of these stars. And on the fifth day God commanded the waters to produce living
animals that swim in the water, and birds that fly on the earth under the sky.
"And God saw that it was good,” and he said, "Grow and
multiply." Moses adds, "And God saw that these things were good"
to make those who dare to say that they are evil to blush. For as soon as they
are pleasing to God their creator, no one has the right to find them evil.
There are those who push the extravagance to the point of saying: "He has
seen these things, and he has found them good, a proof that he was ignorant of
it before.” O fools, how could he have ignored it? All he wanted was done. Can
we say that we want what we do not know, and that the one who has the power to
do does not know what he is doing? And what is stronger, it will be said that
he did not create these things himself, but that he commanded that they be
made, and that he who commanded did not have the power to do? But as everything
is possible, by commanding what he could not do, he began to have that power
which was to turn to his glory. We must therefore admit here a double power in
the commandment of inanimate matter to produce animate beings. On the sixth
day, God commanded the earth to produce living animals, quadrupeds and other
beasts of the earth. And that was so, and the animals were created. And God saw
that these things are good and very good, because they are all necessary. That
same day God said, "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness, and
let him command all the creatures of the earth." God first made all the
substances of which the world was to be composed, and it was after the world
was organized, clothed with all its ornaments, and provided with all the
necessary things, he created man to enjoy the world and all that God had
prepared for him. For all other creatures he commanded the waters and the earth
to produce them; but when it was a question of making man, the sacred author
represents him taking from the silt of the earth, to teach us the difference which
separated man from all that he had created up to that time. It is in order to
raise the dignity of man that he describes it to us from the hands of God, and
made in the image and likeness of God, that is, of the Father and the Son. We
have spoken elsewhere of this image and likeness of God; however, the
opportunity and the matter we are dealing with require that we talk about it
again. It is the Father who says to his Son: "Let us make man in our image
and in our likeness," and the very act of creation is the work of two
persons, one speaking and one listening. This image of God is thus in man in
the sense that he was created alone, as a master from whom all others were to
come, and who was invested with the authority of God as his substitute, for
every king bears the image of God. For this reason the woman was not made in
the image of God, for thus is Moses saying: And God created man, and he made
him in the likeness of God. What the Apostle says: "For man, he must not
cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman veils
her head because she is neither the glory nor the image of God (I Cor. 11:7).”
The likeness of God in man consists in the fact that woman comes from man as
the son comes from the father, with that very great difference which woman has
been made, and that the son is born. There are some who believe that God
created everything simultaneously. If he has done everything by his word, they
say, why should he not have done everything simultaneously? However, it is
generally believed that God created the world successively. It is believed that
it is from the greatness of the divine power that it was created all in one
day. Let us consider how great is the providence of God in this mode of
successive creation. He could certainly create everything simultaneously, but
multiplied reasons prevented it, and to enter into no detail we must believe in
the divine Scripture which often says and repeats: "The Lord your God made
in six days heaven and earth, the sea and all that they contain.” All these
things must have been done thus to make men feel and know that they were
created. Seeing that not all the creatures had existed simultaneously, but that
some had been created today, others the another day, they recognized that they
had had a beginning and that they could not in any way claim to eternity, since
their creation had been partial and successive. If all the creatures had
existed simultaneously, they would not have the feeling of their infirmity, and
would imagine that they had no beginning, for the things which are the
simultaneous product of the word of God, perceive that they have been created;
for this reason they must have been made, the naked first, the others second.
And so that beings who have been created at first do not regard themselves as
imperfect, seeing themselves create more excellent beings, they attribute to
themselves the same perfection which they consider in others. Thus the light
which is called the day was preceded by heaven and earth, that is, by water and
the arid element. Now, as the water, the arid element, and the darkness were
plunged in the confusion of chaos, they could not claim eternity for them,
since none of these elements had any definite state or property. The sun and
the moon, the most brilliant stars, were preceded by many created beings. It is
thus that the more excellent beings who have been created the last, and the
first created, who are less perfect, cannot ascribe to each other an eternal
existence. Moreover, the work of creation, which was consummated in six days,
is the symbol of the duration of the whole world, that is to say, that the
works of the six days represent six thousand years, to be accomplished
successively in each century, is found in the works of the six days. So did not
be so widespread on earth; this is why the first days of the creation are
unclear; animals are created before man, because the first men must live in
ignorance, and follow their coarse instincts as animals; and man is created on
the sixth day, because it is in the sixth millennium that the advent of Christ
came to give man a new creation which anchored him from the tyranny of death.
Man is created in the image of God because he owes his grace to bear in his
soul the image of the Son of God, to the testimony of the apostle St. John:
"We know that when he comes in his glory we shall be like him (I Jn.
3:2).” And the Apostle Paul says, "We are in conformity with the image of
the Son of God (Rom. 8:29)." The tree of life which was planted in
paradise was the image of the future grace of God, that is to say, of the body
of the Lord who gives to him feeds on eternal life. The tree of the knowledge
of good and evil signifies the law given by Moses, who, by making known the sin
that was hidden before, gave mankind the knowledge of good and evil. God rests
on the seventh day of all his works, because the sixth millennium completed, he
will rest in the seventh with the world that will cease all its works. We have
chosen these considerations among several others to facilitate the
understanding of these truths according to the principles which we have
explained.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

2.</font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> WHY DID GOD CREATE THE WORLD? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— God made the world because he is
the supreme craftsperson, or if he is challenged by this title, let it be said
openly; but his works themselves show it clearly. Will I be asked: before he
created them, were all things in nothingness, or what was there before
creation? The correct ones answers this question in a few words: "It is in
him that we have life, movement and being," (Acts 17:28), that is, all
things are in God, because He is everywhere, and since He existed alone from
all eternity before all things, in a manner invisible to every creature, and so
as not to evade this mystery, or rather to ignore why the world was made. We
say that the devil, by his apostasy, has led a great number of angels, that is
to say, the spiritual powers in his prevarication, when he wished, in his proud
impiety, to usurp the very throne of God. This is what the prophet is saying
when he says, "How did you come down from heaven, shining star, son of the
dawn?" (Isa. 14:12) that is to say, was more brilliant than all the stars.
He was the leader of many legions which he surpassed all in splendor, and at
the head of which he engaged this sacrilegious combat. He saw beneath him a
multitude of spiritual powers, and as the knowledge of the mysteries of heaven
raised him in paradise above all others, he wanted to be called God. Every day
he finds imitators in the present life, who are proud to see a multitude of
soldiers gathered around them, want to exploit this hearth of conspiracy which
is offered to them by their followers, and seek to usurp the sovereign
authority. It was then that God, willing to punish his presumption, not by his
power, but by reason, created matter which was a confused mass of elements that
served to create the world. In establishing the distinction in this confusion,
God gave the world that order, that brightness which we admire. The elements
having separated from each other, formed by their arrangement what we call the
world, because each thing distinctly separated from each other, coincided with
its formation. As for the man placed on this earth, he is a compound of two
natures, one superior, the other inferior, one celestial, the other
terrestrial, and his creation clearly establishes the sovereign authority of a
single God who made man not only by his word, but in his image, and created him
alone to be the source from which the human race was to emerge. God wanted to
create only one man to establish that all things come from one principle, and
that there is therefore only one God, so that the higher creature learns for
its confusion the truth by example of the man who had been created from the earth.
From that moment the devil became the enemy of man. He sensed that the man had
been created to accuse him; so he put into action all the subtleties of his
nature to drag him into the prevarication in which he had fallen himself, and
thus share his condemnation with his accuser. He promised him, therefore, as
the fruit of his disobedience, the divinity, who, by attempting to usurp him by
his pride, was precipitated into the abyss. Now, as every nature is free by its
creation of every evil principle, it takes its name from its accidents. The
thing signified precedes the name which must signify it. Thus the composition
of the names of Satan and devil come from his works, and are the expression not
of his nature, but of his will. Now, that the eternal purposes and decrees of
God in the creation of man would have, and that the devil had made the height
of the crime that had precipitated man into ruin, Christ deigned to descend
from heaven on earth, to deliver man from the penalty of his disobedience and
to make known the punishments reserved for the devil, and to turn men away from
imitating his conduct. This is why the apostle Saint John says: "The Son
of God came into the world to destroy the works of the devil” (1 Jn. 3:8). Now,
if he were evil by nature, it would be folly or injustice to predict
punishment. Who dreams of condemning the one whom he sees acting only according
to his nature? Who is angry at the fire, because it burns, against the water,
because it cools, both acting in it only according to their nature and not by
an act of their will? If, then, the devil were evil in his nature, he would not
have a will here. He would be incapable of discernment and he would behave like
a blind man to all things in one and the same way. On the contrary, he acts with
a certain discernment; he spares those who do his will, he uses concealment and
neophiles, he sows obstacles and impediments under the feet of those who want
to resort to the protection of God; he pitches his servants with pitfalls, and
he declares himself especially against those who obey more faithfully the
divine wills. It is therefore obvious that his will is all in the wrong. This
is why the Apostle St. Peter tells us: "Be sober and watch, for the demon
your enemy surrounds you like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
(2 Pet. 5:8) It is not the pagans, it is not the Jews, it is not the people of
bad life and manners he attacks, it is the faithful servants of God and Jesus
Christ that he knows how to be his enemies, because they condemn his enterprise
and his pride. When the law was given, his jealousy became more ardent against
those who lived under him, because he knew that the law taught men the
existence of one God, and the rules of a pure and holy life. If therefore we
believe that the devil acts only by virtue of his nature, we cannot admit that
he is guilty, because he acts how he can act according to his nature, and that
he does not do what he cannot do, because it is contrary to his nature. He
deserves neither praise nor condemnation; his actions are harmful, nor
condemnation, because he does not act voluntarily, but by the impulse of his
nature. We know that men with sudden madness have wounded their fellows with
sticks, swords, stones, or by their bites, and that they have killed even some
of them. They have been taken with care by their persons to bring them before
the tribunals. They declared them innocent because they had not acted knowingly
and voluntarily, but under the impulse of some kind of force, trained. How
indeed to establish the guilt of a man who does not know what he did? If
therefore the devil does not know the good, why judge him worthy of
condemnation, because he does not do what he does not know? On the contrary, if
it were possible, he would be rather praiseworthy because he does what he does
not know. For us, it is with all justification that we have become guilty
because we do not do what we know we must do; or because we do what we know how
to defend ourselves. Now all the Scriptures agree with declaring the devil guilty;
that is why we read that the torment of hell is reserved to him, and that the
divine law condemned him without return, because he did evil while knowing and
being able to do good. God, indeed, justice itself, would not condemn him for
not doing the good he did not know, but for doing the evil he knew. I therefore
regard it as an incontestable truth, that no substance can be called bad,
because all evil, as we have shown, derives from the will which has come to
vitiate nature by means of the senses.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THAT THIS WORLD EXISTS NATURALLY FROM ALL ETERNITY, AND THAT IT HAS NEITHER
BEGINNING NOR END? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
That the world exists from eternity and that it is independent, is both
implausible and impossible. We see him composed of a multitude of diverse
bodies; Now, simplicity is the essential attribute of a divine and eternal
being; it must present no diversity, but the most perfect unity. The world is
not even uniform in the succession of times; not only are there differences of
time and contrary substances, but the succession of times is not regular. Now
an eternal substance is sovereignly removed from all diversity, it is not
accessible to touch or sight, because it is incorporeal. The world on the
contrary is subject to the alteration, the water is in opposition with the
fire; if the fire becomes stronger, it triumphs over the water, and the earth,
in its turn, dry and cold nature, flames up like a material thing. We cannot,
therefore, admit the eternity of this world which we see subjected to so many
changes and alterations, which wears and ages from century to century, and
which we believe we must someday end. But what must we think of the man who
believes the eternal world? Man certainly begins to exist in the world; Now,
before it existed, what was the use of the annual fertility of the earth? Shall
we say that this fertility existed without any design or as chance? And how
could an eternal being produce corruptible and mortal beings, whereas an
eternal being can only come out an eternal being? How yet dare to call eternal
what is seen, what is felt, and what is touched? How is eternal to call what is
subject to the succession of times, a succession itself which is not always
uniform or regular? For eternity is not subject to no alteration, and has no
change.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

3.</font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> WHAT NEED WAS IT TO MAKE IT KNOWN
BY MOSES THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD AND THE ORDER OF CREATION, AND NOT BEFORE
HIM? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— This
story should not have been written before Moses, because creation had not yet
given rise to such great errors among men. But it became necessary as soon as
these errors spread in the human race, until the children of Israel heard the
philosophers of Egypt who had instructed Moses in all the sciences of the
Egyptians, which contradicted the truth of creation and affirmed that a certain
Apis had created this world by means of the evil angels, and that Satan is the
prince of this world. Marcion adopted this sense for his ruin. The Manichaeans
claim that this same Satan created man, but not the world, and in this they are
more insane than others. For it is a certain truth that the world was created
for man, and they come to say that God created this world, though of a foreign
matter, while man was created by his enemy, that is to say, one would have
placed a master in the house of the other. Moses, therefore, had to point out
and destroy this error, to teach that the creation of man as of the world had
God alone as Master. The authority given to Moses by the miracles and wonders
he performed guaranteed the truth of his teaching, supported by such
testimonies. Indeed, who would refuse to believe the author of such great
miracles? That is why those who contradict this doctrine are easily convinced
of error, because they have only their word as supporter of their affirmations.
Moses wishing to demonstrate that nothing is co-eternal with God, first
explains the order in which creation was made, the creatures less important
first and then the most important, proving that none absolutely was uncreated.
Indeed, those of a later creation have greater excellence. To those who sought
to excite the time when the former were created, may oppose their inferiority
of nature which subjects them to those which are their posterior origin. If, on
the contrary, they claim primacy in favor of the more excellent creatures,
their pretensions are opposed by the rank of order they occupy in creation. So
that there is none which has not had a beginning. Above all, God created heaven
and earth (Gen. 1:1). Then the light destined to light the day. Then the sky,
and the clusters of waters which receive the name of the sea, and above which
appeared the habitable earth. The earth which Moses presents to us as having
been made after heaven, is not entirely the earth properly so called, but all
the lower creatures and all the material elements. The sky which was created in
the beginning is not this visible heaven, but the higher and spiritual heaven.
Therefore when Moses tells us that God first made heaven and earth, he hears of
all things invisible in heaven, and by the earth all the visible things God
created. By thus uniting the two extreme terms of all nature, he establishes in
a certain manner that all intermediate beings must have been created equally.
The stars which he placed in order to regulate the order of the universe were
created on the fourth day, and the time of their creation is in reverse
relation to the excellence of their nature. As for man, he created him on the
sixth day, in order to introduce him only in a perfectly completed dwelling.
Now the man we see created on the sixth day is far superior to all other
creatures, and this superiority comes above all from his inner nature,
invisible and endowed with intelligence. The sun is the brightest, and the moon
is brighter than the earth. This is why some people do not like the saying of
Genesis, And God saw that the light was good (Gen. 1:4). As they asserted that
all creatures had an evil principle as their author, and that they could not
believe in their goodness. Moses, in order to establish the goodness of all
things created, shows that God found them good in proportion as he made them,
and thus condemns him who would be tempted to find them evil. How can we suppose
that he who said, Let there be light, and there was light (Gen. 1:3), did not
know the light? Can we do what we do not know? Now the light as soon as it was
made, pleased the one who had made it. What craftsman does not find his joy in
his work? This is why it is written, And he saw that the light was good (Gen.
1:4). And yet there are those who maintain that it is bad. What would it be if
God had left this truth without witness? Thus, after the account of the
creation of the world, Moses reveals the succession of the human race from the
first man, first by Seth, who replaced Abel (Cf. Gen. 4:25), and by order to
Abraham, the father of the Jewish people. He shows that Abraham believed in the
Creator God of the world, and that this same God gave the law in which were
contained the promises of the future Christ who was to deliver mankind from the
tyranny of the devil. It is through these authorities that we prove how
reasonable our faith is. For this account of the origins of the world makes
this testimony to our faith that Christians go back to the beginning of the
world. In fact, from Seth, the sons of Adam, we descend to Enoch; from Enoch to
Noah; from Noah to Abraham; from Abraham to David; from David to Mary, from
whom Jesus Christ is born through the operation of the Holy Spirit. All those
who in ancient times have faith in one God, whom the Savior preached, deserve
the name of Christians. For the promise of the Savior to come is from the
beginning of the world. This is why St. John calls him in his Apocalypse,
"The Lamb slain from the beginning of the world. (Rev. 13:8.) Christians
have always existed. All those, of whom I have spoken, who have existed since
the first man, and through whom we come to the Savior, have faith in that God
of whom Jesus Christ said: and eternal life consists in knowing you the only
true God, and the one you sent, Jesus Christ (Jn. 17:2). But can we not make
this objection: If all those you speak of were Christians before the coming of
the Savior, what knowledge did Jesus bring to us? The advent of Jesus Christ
has developed the understanding of this truth, because preaching has revealed
the mystery which this unique God contained, the properties of each divine
person, and that to make us fulfill the righteousness of the law, Jesus Christ
gave us the graces that God kept in reserve.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  SPIRIT OF GOD WAS CARRIED ON THE WATERS?" </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—<span>   </span></font><font size="3">If there is an error in this proposal, we
  should admit it. Some believe that it is a question of the Holy Spirit,
  because it is called the Spirit of God, an opinion devoid of all proof and
  all foundation. Not only do order and reason refuse the interpretation, but
  the text itself is powerless to establish it. For we frequently find the same
  words used by sacred writers in another sense. Thus, among other things, the
  Lord God said: "My spirit shall not abide in these men, because they are
  flesh; (Gen. 6:5), and he adds: "Exterminate every creature, from man to
  animals.” Will it be said that in these words, where the Lord predicts the
  deluge which he is to send on earth, it is a question of the Holy Spirit? Did
  he not wish to speak of souls? For the name of spirit is given not only to
  our souls, those of animals. Indeed, it is written: "And all flesh in
  which the spirit of life was found died in the waters." (Gen. 7:21) We
  also read in the prophet Ezekiel when God promises by his mouth the resurrection
  of the human race: "This is what the Lord says: I will stretch the skin
  upon you, and I will give you of my spirit, and you shall live (Ez. 37:5).”
  Is this the question of the Holy Spirit, or rather did he not wish to speak
  of the soul? All heavenly creatures are spirits, but they diverge from each
  other; God himself is spirit (Jn. 4:24), but of a very different nature.
  Every spirit, then, is of the spirit of God, but is not God, however, except
  the spirit which is of itself, and whose particular character is sanctity.
  Men are also called the sons of God, as Jesus Christ is called Himself the
  Son of God, but there is this difference that He is the true Son of God, and
  that men are only His adopted sons. The same difference exists in the use of
  this name of spirit of God. The Holy Spirit comes from God, it is
  consubstantial; the other spirits are called the spirits of God, but they are
  mere creatures. The order itself refuses to admit that it was the Holy Spirit
  who was carried on the waters. Reason teaches us that above the waters there
  exists a spiritual creature which has above itself a more excellent creature,
  because one creature differs in clarity from another creature (1 Cor. 15:41);
  for the more the heavenly creatures are near the throne of God, the more
  brilliant are their ministries. That is why the angel Raphael said to Tobit,
  "I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who stand and
  spend their lives in the presence of the majesty of God. (Tob. 12:15)</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  to the intellect to discern the things which have a common name. Thus the
  name of spirit is given to God, to the soul of man, to the wind, to the air,
  to the soul of animals, to angels and all creatures who have received to live
  of their own nature. But intelligence here helps you to discern that God is
  called mind very differently from creatures, so you understand that Jesus
  Christ and men are called the Son of God in a very different sense. Whenever
  Scripture wishes to designate the spirit which is properly of God, it adds:
  the Holy Spirit; it thus excludes every idea of ​​a creature, and makes it
  understood that the spirit being of God, can itself be nothing but God. Moses
  describing the creation of the nature, that is to say, the confusion of all
  things which was deprived of all feeling, represents to us the spirit of God
  carried on the earth, on the abyss and on the darkness, to make us understand
  by this name and the place where the spirit was carried, that it was a
  question of a superior creature which we call spiritual. For this reason he
  represents this spirit as being carried over the waters, and he wanted to
  designate a creature, for every creature of God is carried by the virtue of
  him who gave it existence. Now, how could it be in the order that the Holy
  Spirit was carried over the waters, he who, by the confession of all, is
  above all creature? If Jesus Christ is at the right hand of God above all
  heaven (Col. 4), the Holy Spirit is also there. Beings who have the same
  excellence and the same nature are inseparable. We confess, no doubt, that
  God, that is to say the Almighty Trinity, is everywhere, yet we attribute to
  him that singular honor of being above every creature as a privilege of his
  own. That is why we say, "Our Father who are in heaven," and
  "Who dwells in an inaccessible light."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

fact, the elements which were to serve the creation of the</font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">
world, and which were created simultaneously, appear to us to be devoid of
light (Gen. 1:2), that is to say, water, earth, darkness of which the world has
been formed, that is, of an invisible or dark matter, as it is said in the book
of Wisdom, whose author is Solomon. (Wis. 11:18.) The Holy Letters attest that
darkness and water were created when they related these words of God in the
prophet Isaiah: "I, God, have made light, I created the darkness (Isa.
45:47).” The Holy Spirit also teaches us by the mouth of David that the waters
were created and the earth was established on the waters (Ps. 135:9), which is
according to the authority of the Gospel (Jn. 1:3), and to the tradition of the
apostles, who testify that all things have been done; and for nothing to be
excepted, the Apostle takes care to say, "Let the things that are in
heaven, or those that are on the earth (Col. 1:16)." As far as the earth
is concerned, we read that the darkness existed before the light, as to the
order followed in creation and not as to excellence, for the light is worth a
thousand times better than the darkness. Now in the organization of the world
the light receives the name of day, and the darkness the name of night; that is
to say, when the light ceases to illuminate the darkness, the time which passes
until the return of the light is called night, and the time when it penetrates
the darkness of its light is called day. It is said, then, that it is night
when one is in the hope of the day to come, and that it is day when one is
waiting for the night to follow. When the succession of day and night has
ceased with the end of the world, there will be nothing but darkness and light.
Indeed, it can no longer be said that it is night when the darkness will be
continuous, nor that it is day when the light will have no more decline.
Eternity stops the use of those names that began with the world. Thus, before
the creation of the light which received the name of day, it is not read that
there is night, but darkness; and after the disappearance of the light which
shines upon them, they have received the name of evening and night. As far as
we can judge, night is subordinated to the day. From what we read that darkness
existed before light, it does not follow that they are preferable to light; For
heaven existed before the sun, and yet the sun is superior to it; the earth was
created before man as well as the beasts of the fields and other animals, and
yet they are subjected to man. The night, therefore, must not be above the day,
because we read that the darkness has preceded, since light prevails much over
darkness, and day is much preferable to night. As we said above, light was
created when the darkness existed. "And God gave the light the name of
day, and darkness the name of night, and evening and morning was the first day.”
If there were not in the day, there would have been no night, for it was when
the darkness ceased to be enlightened, when the day was gone reads that evening
elapsed. And when the light came to shine after the evening, it formed the
first day after the night, so that night came after the day. It is worthy,
indeed, and in conformity with reason, that the inferior nature is in
everything subject to a more excellent nature. Why then put the night before
daybreak, since its name comes only after the name of day? For it had not
received the name of night or evening, if the light had not shone for the space
of a day, after which the evening was set at night. The day becomes evening to
make you understand that night is a part of the day, for the day is complete only
when the night is past. Thus we say, The year is three hundred and sixty-five
days, and we do not separate from it the nights. In counting the days, we also
count the nights which are included under the name of days. If, on the
contrary, the night was preceding the day, the day would be understood under
the name of night. Who ever thought of saying, "I will see you after five
nights, and not after five days." Nowhere, if we have a good memory, we
read that night is set before daylight. "Moses," says the Scriptures,
"was on the mountain forty days and forty nights (24:18).” The Psalmist
also says, "The sun shall not bother you during the day, nor the moon in
the night.” And to borrow an example from the beginning of the world, we read
in Genesis: "Let the bodies of light be made in the sky, and shine on the
earth (Ps. 120:6), one bigger to start the day, the other less great to start
the night. Now the moon cannot be placed above the sun, just as night cannot be
placed above the light; but night is subordinate to the day as the moon is in
the sun.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">The Gospel also shows us the
nights included under the name and in the enumeration of days. "There are
some," says the Savior, "who are here present, who shall not die till
they have seen the reign of God." And he adds: "And it came to pass
about a week after, and so on (Jn. 1:28).” Are not the nights included in these
eight days? And in another place: "This," says the Evangelist,
"took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John baptized. The next
day, John saw Jesus coming to him (Jn. 1:28).” Did he say: The next night?
Further on he says, "The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee," and
in the following chapter: "Three days after that, a wedding was celebrated
and Cana was celebrated in Galilee (Jn. 11:1).” Everywhere the day has
pre-eminence over the night which is subordinate to it. If the day was
understood under the name of night, night would precede the day. The Romans
reign over the Spaniards, the Gauls, the Africans, and the other peoples who
are subject to them, and by this very reason these people take the name of
Romans; thus the night which is subordinate to the day is included under the
name of day. The reason for this is that the Jews begin the celebration of the
Sabbath in the evening, and they do not consider the reason for this
commandment. The day before, they must buy and prepare their food for the
sabbath day, and purify themselves according to the law. Now, can they do these
things during the night and begin the Sabbath with the rising of the day? There
is no doubt that the resurrection of our Lord took place at night; yet it is in
the day that it is honored. It is in the day that this resurrection is
celebrated, and that day is called the day of the Lord. Do you not read in the
Psalms: "This is the day which the Lord hath made? (Ps. 117:24)” We do not
say the night of the Lord, because the day has primacy here. Whether it be a
matter of the past or of the day to come, night is always subordinate to it,
because it is of an inferior nature, to the apostle's testimony: "You are
the children of the day and the day light, and not of night and darkness (I
Thess. 5:5).” If we wish to take an example in consuls, we shall see that the
first named is the one who was the first chosen. Is it not customary to say,
"Who will be consul with him?" If night was before daylight, it would
be named first. It is so true that it is by day that we begin to count time,
that if, for example, we say: tomorrow is the sixth of the calends, we mean all
the space which flows from one morning to another and which is composed of one
whole day and one night. So again the moon at the beginning of the world was
created on the fourteenth day, for it must have gleamed all night, and the next
morning was its fifteenth day. How, then, can any doubt remain about the
pre-eminence of the day? The disputes of a certain number have compelled us to
extend ourselves at length to an obvious matter, for the text of Scripture
alone is sufficient to conclude the question, since it clearly shows us the day
before the night. All the reasons we have explained are borrowed from the
history of the origin of the world. But if we wish to elevate ourselves to
higher considerations, by giving our spirit a spiritual vigor, we shall see
that it is improper to affirm that darkness was created before light. If the
nature of light is celestial and the nature of earthly darkness, it is absurd
to think that light was made after the darkness. Moses says that light has been
made, but for the part of the world that it illuminates, and it does not say
that it only then began to exist. Indeed, all spiritual beings were created
before material beings, and the light that already existed in the higher
regions descended into the lower ones to shine like a flaming beam in a house.
But for what reason is the darkness named before the light, since it always
follow the light? Let us say that celestial and spiritual things are
enlightened by their nature, whereas earthly and fleshly things are darkness,
so that the nature of darkness appears to subsist only by the power of light,
because all that is inferior depends on which is above. If we look carefully,
we will find darkness even in the sun. Place yourself near it, it will appear
to you so striking that you cannot look at it; move away a little, its radiance
will be the same, but you can stop your gaze for a moment; but it is less
brilliant, and its brilliance is always diminished by reason of your
separation. There is in it, then, as a successive weakening which proclaims the
darkness, and this point that the darkness appears to spring from the light.
The one who made the light also created darkness, in the way that in creating
the water he created the earth at the same time; and the darkness is the defect
of light, as the earth is the solid part of the waters. God is the only one who
has no decline, and although he is everywhere, and contains all things in
himself, his splendor is so striking that he cannot be seen by anyone, does not
consent to temper His brilliance. The Savior himself, when clothed in a body,
was visible only when he wished, even without being shut up. The glorious glory
in the midst of which he appeared on the mountain in his transfiguration,
remained hidden in his body, and manifested itself externally only when he
wished it (Matt. 17:1). One, how was he hidden without being shut up? If he
could enter with his body in the place where his disciples were, and when the
doors were closed, how could his divinity not penetrate all things? that is to
say that its rays cannot be intercepted because it suffers no decline. God
therefore fills everything with His presence, but we say, however, that He is
the place where He appears and wants to manifest Himself to the gaze. All
things are in God, because he is above all things, to the apostle's testimony:
"It is in him that we have life, movement and being (Acts 17:28),”
however, it is only in that which he wishes to be. He is in everything by the
mystery of his immensity, and he manifests himself by an eloquence and his providence
only in whatever he desires.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

image and likeness.” There are some who want to hear these words in the same
way as those others where God says again: "Come, go down and let us confuse
their tongues.” (Gen. 11:17) To see only the mark of the letter, these words
are similar, it is the voice of one who speaks in the plural; but the meaning
is far from the same, because the circumstances are quite different. On one
side is the creation of man, whom God wants to create in his image and
likeness. These words, on the contrary, "come, go down, and let us confuse
their tongues," were intended to prevent men from coming to an
understanding. We can therefore admit that God speaks here to his angels, like
a general to his army. He speaks here in the plural and collectively, because
it is through them that he must act as their Creator, and that is why he says:
Let us confuse their languages. When he says: Let us make man in our image and
likeness, we cannot say that he is speaking to angels, for we cannot say that
angels have the same image with God, as a general with his soldiers. Those who
have the same image cannot have a different dignity, a different nature.
Besides, the sacred writer adds: "And God has made man, and has appointed
him in his image," that is, it is God who speaks, and God who acts, he is
not another God, a different God, it is one and the same God. This language
from one subject to another does not imply another nature, but another person.
For although there is only one God, there are three persons, and there is only
one God, because in the Son, as in the Holy Spirit, there is only one God, only
one and the same nature, for everything that comes out of this nature can only
be what God is himself. It is therefore the person of the Father who says,
"Let us make," and the person of the Son who makes man in the image
of God, either in the image of the Father or in his own, does not matter, since
they have one and the same image. Now, the Son has made man by the Holy Spirit,
for just as Scripture represents the Father acting through the Son, so the Son
acts by the Holy Spirit, as He declares Himself: It is through the Spirit of
God that I cast out demons. (Matt. 12) The image of the three divine persons is
therefore the same, since, whether we consider the Father, the Son, the Holy
Spirit, it is one God. Thus one man was made in the image of one God. Now, man
is made in the image of God in the sense that just as there is in the heavens
only one God, through whom all the heavenly spirits subsist, there was also on
the earth only one man of God, which all others would derive their origin
according to the flesh. There are, however, some who think that man was made in
the image of God in the power he received to command, because God said to him,
"Let him rule over the fish of the sea, birds of heaven and all over the
earth," as we see all these things subject not only to the man, but to the
woman, who is certainly not made in the image of God. This view is false for
two reasons, firstly because it would follow that it was not to the Son that
God would have said, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," but
to the celestial powers that the Apostle enumerates, if the image of God
stamped on man is the power of command; and secondly because the woman would be
made herself in the image of God, which is an absurdity. For how can one say of
the woman that she is in the image of God, whom we see subject to the empire of
man without having any authority? For she can neither teach nor lay in justice,
nor commit her word, nor judge, how much less can she command?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  created in its likeness, because, just as the Son comes from the Father, so
  woman is formed of man to consecrate the authority of a single principle. But
  the Son was born of God the Father in an incomprehensible and unintelligible
  manner; the woman, on the contrary, as we read, was formed outwardly of man
  (Gen. 2:21) to give birth to other men. The Son of God was born so that all
  things were created by him. This is the difference. The Son was born God of
  God the Father, whereas woman was formed of man, for simplicity is one of the
  attributes of the divine nature, and a simple being can only emerge from a
  simple nature, a spirit, a God of a God. Man is therefore the image of God,
  as it is written, <i>God created man, and
  created him in the image of God</i></font><font size="3"> (Gen. 1:27). This is why the Apostle
  says: "Man should not cover his head, because he is the image and glory
  of God; the woman, to the contrary; must put a veil over his head. (I Cor.
  11:7) Why? Because she is not the image of God. It is for the same reason
  that he says elsewhere: "I do not allow women to teach or take authority
  over their husbands (1 Tim. 2:12).”</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></font><font size="3">If we consider the circumstance in question, they give rise to no

Thus the apostle St. Peter says: "I have never eaten anything common or
unclean (Acts 10:14),” and St. Paul: "All that does not come from faith is
sin (Rom. 14:23),” and elsewhere, "The law does not come from faith (Gal.
3:12),” and yet it is not a sin. You see, therefore, that the same expression
does not always have the same meaning. When, therefore, a thing is qualified as
impure, it is necessary to consider in what sense, for it is sometimes given
this qualification only by comparison with a more perfect thing, sometimes, on
the contrary, they wish to express by impure and truly evil works. No substance
is evil in its nature, and things which are naturally called evil are only evil
by comparison with more excellent natures. Thus, a dog is said to be impure in
comparison with a sheep, lead is unclean if compared with gold, the raven when
compared to the peacock. In the same body there are members more honorable than
the others, and we know that they are not bad. All things therefore are good in

LIKE BODIES? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
It seems to me unseemly to say that souls are engendered simultaneously with
bodies, and that the soul gives birth to the soul, a property which God has not
given to the soul. If each of the celestial powers has been given the power to
give existence to all others in creation, one might admit that all souls derive
from the one soul of Adam. But this feeling is not admissible, because the
generation of a simple being is a privilege which God has exclusively reserved
for himself. This generation, considered in the person of the Savior, is so
mysterious that not only pagans and Jews, but even those who call themselves
Christians, regard it as an incredible thing. Indeed, the Photinians and the
Arians reject this article of faith and refuse to believe that God has
begotten. Will it be said that at the moment when the germ of the body is sown,
the soul begets the soul? But we read that God drew a rib of Adam without the sacred
writer adding that the soul gave birth to the soul. If a soul were joined to
this seed, it cannot be said that this soul was born, it is a part detached
from another soul. Nor does Scripture say anything about this circumstance. We
read, on the contrary, in the prophet Zechariah: "God who has formed in
man the spirit of man (Zech. 12:1).” He speaks the same truth when he says,
"This is what the Lord has said to you who created you, who formed you in
your mother's womb (Is. 44:2).” If the soul is formed in the womb of the
mother, it is united to a body which has already received its form. As it
extends its action to all the members of the body, it is said of the soul that
it is formed in the body. Thus, just as water, which has no particular form,
receives one from the vessel that contains it, the soul, incorporeal and simple
substance, receives as its form in the body by communicating life to all its
members. This is what Moses expresses even more clearly in these words:
"If men quarrel, and one strike a woman with child, and she miscarry
indeed, but live herself: he shall be answerable for so much damage as the
woman's husband shall require, and as arbiters shall award” (Exod. 21:22),
words which prove that the soul is not united to the body before it is formed.
If to the seed of the body is joined with the incorporeal seed of the soul, a
great number of souls perish daily, when the seed is lost without being
followed by birth. But if we look at it more closely, we will see the feeling
that we need to adopt. Consider the creation of Adam. In the person of Adam we
have an example which makes us understand that the body was already formed when
it received its soul. God could doubtless mix the soul with the silt of the
earth and thus form the body. But a sovereign reason presided over his
formation; it was necessary first to construct and assemble the different parts
of the house before introducing the one which was to inhabit it. The soul being
a spirit cannot dwell in a solid element; it is for this reason that it is said
to be shed in the blood. When, then, the lineaments of the body are not yet
formed, where can the soul be? Shall it go abroad, until it be united? But
reason teaches us that it exists only to animate the body, and not to wander
without fulfilling any function. Now let those who think differently tell us
from whom the soul comes. Is it man or woman? Will they say of the woman? We
cannot accept this thought because the example in question is contrary to it.
For they say that the soul was given to the woman with the seed that was drawn
from man, this thought is debated, as we have seen, for a great number of
reasons. Perhaps one will be tempted to say that the soul is given by woman,
especially because of the Savior, who was born of woman by the operation of the
Holy Spirit, apart from any carnal union. But this thought gives too much to
woman by attributing to her a right and an authority which belongs to man.
Moreover, they assert that it is from man that the origin of the body and the
soul originates, and now, changing their minds, they attribute to woman the
origin of the most excellent nature, of the soul, and to man the origin of the
less perfect nature, that is to say of the body, whereas it is manifest that
one cannot change the order that God followed in the example he gave us.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

DID ADAM HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT?</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— I discovered that some of our brethren
who have not made a thorough study of the Scriptures, claim with a certain
simplicity that Adam as soon as he was created, received the Holy Spirit as it
is now given to the faithful, and that he lost the Spirit by his sin. They rely
on a feeling supported by a great number, that the reparation of man has taken
place by faith which has restored him to his former state, and restored to him
all that Adam had received from his creation. Moreover, they say, man has been
created perfect, which can only be admitted as much as he has received the Holy
Spirit. For me, I declare that not only man, but all things that God has made,
he has created them in a state of perfection, although it cannot be said that
they have received the Holy Spirit. All species of animals are perfect in their
kind to complete the end of their creation, so man is perfect in his kind, in
that he can discern the evil of good, the error of truth. He is an intelligent
animal, perfect for the purpose God has created by creating him. He is endowed
at the same time with speech, thought, and action, and accomplishes by
intelligence what he cannot do by his power. How, then, have we dared to say
that man must be born perfect with the absolute knowledge of all things, while
it is evident that he knows nothing but what he learns? What he does not learn,
he does not know. Thus, he does not know what he is, because it is not the
object of his study here below, but he who does not know what he is, how can he
know everything, although it is less difficult to know oneself than to know all
the other things? But as his mind turns to these things, instead of studying
himself, he acquires knowledge of what is outside of him, without knowing
himself, without knowing whether he existed before or after his body. If man
had been created in a state of perfection which would have excluded all need,
it would not have been a man, but a god, and he would not have yielded to the
seduction which was the cause of his sin. But to have the Holy Spirit in
oneself is a privilege above the natural perfection of man and which gives him
the power to do the things of God. Did the ass who spoke to Balaam not do an
action superior to his nature? (Num. 22:28) It was given the faculty to do what
was not in its nature. but in ours. But because man is of a nature superior to
that of animals, does it follow that animals are imperfect? The holy angels are
not what God is; will it be said that they are imperfect? ​​The planets and the
stars are inferior to the angels of heaven; clouds often come to cover the sun
and the moon like a veil; are these stars less perfect? The members of the body
have a mutual need of each other (because the feet cannot do what the hands
do); is it a reason to say that they are imperfect? No, no doubt. All created
beings have a perfection in relation to the place and rank they occupy and the
end for which they are created. They are therefore all perfect because their
Creator is perfect, yet compared to the Creator, they are obviously imperfect. The
perfection of God extends to everything, because he is the source and the
origin of all things. The created beings are perfect, no doubt, but for the end
that God has given them by creating them. Considered in another respect, they
no longer have this perfection because they need each other. They are perfect
in so far as they are sufficient for themselves, and not as they need a foreign
aid; they are therefore a mixture of perfection and imperfection. The hands
claim the accord of the feet, because if the feet refuse to walk, the hands are
without action. The feet in their turn need the hands, because they can neither
fit themselves nor take from them the care they demand. The body is therefore
perfect in its limbs, however it can neither fly nor carry such heavy loads as
the mule. These animals are themselves perfect, yet they can neither govern
themselves nor administer the remedies they need. What made the Psalmist say:
"Do not be like the horse and the mule, animals without intelligence.” (Ps.
31:9) Water and fire are two incompatible elements, but they are perfect in
their kind because they fulfill the purpose for which they are created. The
fire cooks and consumes the objects on which it expels its activity, it
purifies and warms; water washes, refreshes, sprinkles and quenches thirst. All
created objects are therefore perfect in their kind, yet they cannot do
anything without man, just as man, though more perfect, cannot do without their
help. This is why the Apostle declares that we are imperfect and perfect at the
same time. In comparison with the faithful, we are perfect, because we know
God, but we are imperfect because we do not have sufficient knowledge of the
promises made to us, because as long as we are in this life, we cannot
understand in all their extent the truths that are the object of our faith. Now,
since there are some who think that the faithful come into possession of the
perfection of Adam, let us see if the reparation of man does not open to him a
source of graces more abundant than those given to Adam. Adam was placed in a
garden to cultivate it and to be its faithful guardian, that is to say, to
cultivate the earth and keep the commandments of God which taught him that by
receiving the empire over all created objects he lived, however, under the
control of his Creator, and that this empire did not owe all pride and make him
forget who had created him, he was therefore placed in this garden to support
his existence by the food he needs. But by virtue of the grace that Jesus
Christ gave to men, after their resurrection, they will no longer need to eat
or drink, because that which is mortal in man will then be absorbed by life.
Adam was created to dwell on the earth, but faith gives us the singular hope of
living one day in heaven. Here is the testimony of Scripture itself: "Adam
the first man was created with a living soul; and the second has been filled
with a vivifying spirit. The first man is the terrestrial formed of the earth,
the second is the heavenly who comes from heaven. As the first man was earthly,
his children are also earthly; and as the second is heavenly, his children are
also heavenly.” (1 Cor. 15:45) Is it not evident from these words that Adam did
not receive the Holy Spirit? He has received a living soul, but through Jesus
Christ we receive a life-giving spirit, which in a way renders man like the
Creator in whom he believes. Indeed, the mystery of the faith that man must
believe to be saved is the mystery of God in three persons, and in man we also
see these three things, the body, the soul, and the Holy Spirit, by which we
deserve to be called the children of God, a title which was not given to Adam,
for he was earthly and formed of the earth. But it is the children of God whose
birth is wholly spiritual and not carnal, who deserve to be called heavenly. It
is, therefore, well established that God has given to men at the advent of the
Savior much greater blessings than Adam had received. Man was not only restored
to his former state, he was raised to a more excellent condition; he was
restored to his first state, because he was cleansed of his sins; but for all
the rest he was raised to a much higher perfection. In fact, justice and reason
demanded that the goodness of God should be more abundant in his benefits,
while he deigned to reveal to his creature the mystery of his divinity. Men
having known what had remained hidden for centuries and generations before, the
mystery of God in three persons, it was fitting, to consecrate this new
revelation, that with the remission of their sins and justification, they still
receive the adoption of the children of God and the Holy Spirit who imprints in
them the sign of this adoption. The adoption that comes from God must bear the
sign of God the Father so that we may be called justly the children of God. The
prophets themselves had predicted that this favor would be given to men when
the mystery of God would fail in his triumph over death, so that every creature
would recognize that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were one and the
same God. That is why the Evangelist says: “The Spirit was not given yet,
because Jesus was not yet glorified.” This glorification took place when the
manifestation of his power made him recognize for what he was, according to the
testimony he had given of himself, because this glorification was the source of
the grace promised by the prophet Joel: "In the last days, says God, I
will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, etc." (Joel 2:28, etc.) And the
Apostle on his side: "When the blessing and the tenderness of God our
Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of the works of righteousness that we
have done, but by his mercy, by making us reborn by baptism and renewing us by
the Holy Spirit whom he has shed abundantly upon us by Jesus Christ our Savior,
so that, being justified by His grace, we are heirs, according to the hope of
eternal life." (Titus 3:4) The Apostle confirms the prophet Joel's
prediction, a prediction that God accomplishes after Jesus was glorified,
spreading the Holy Spirit on those who believe in Jesus Christ. However, to
receive the Holy Spirit is to become heirs of eternal life, for the Holy Spirit
is eternal, and he who receives it receives eternal life and immortality whose
Holy Spirit is the pledge. He who receives it and perseveres in his love after
this life enters the heavens to be eternally united with him whose Spirit he
has, for it would be neither right nor just that whoever comes out of this life
having in him the Holy Spirit, was held in hell. Indeed, the sign in the man of
the victory that Jesus Christ has won over death is his Spirit, and he in whom
this Spirit finds himself cannot be held captive in the underworld. So the Holy
Spirit was not in the saints of the old law as it is today in the faithful. These
righteous, at the end of this life, dwelt in hell, and it cannot be said that
because of the sin of Adam, which was transmitted by generation to all his
descendants, condemned them to this captivity, the Holy Spirit himself even was
subject to the sentence of ruling pronounced against Adam. Without a doubt, the
Holy Spirit was with the prophets and righteous of the old law; with the prophets
for the fulfillment of their ministry; with the righteous because of their
holiness, as we read of old Simeon, whose saying is, "The Holy Spirit was
in him," (Luke 2:25) not as a sign of divine adoption, but as a principle
and as a reward for his merits. The sons of God by faith began only when the
Son of God made himself known to all creatures by his triumph over death. If we
wish to maintain that the Holy Spirit was in Adam or the other righteous ones
of the old law, as he is now in the faithful, what are the new ones in which
God made us when he inaugurated among us the kingdom of his Son? And how can
one call, blessed and prosperous above all others, the time when the Savior
appeared on earth, if he did not pour out upon others other graces than those
they had already received? And what do these words of the Savior himself mean
to his disciples? "Many prophets and righteous have desired to see what
you see and have not seen, hear what you hear and have not heard it?"
(Matt. 13:17) By what reason, then, can one say that this blessed time has
given men nothing more than what has been granted to the ancients? Such a
feeling is injurious to the Savior who would not have given men any new thanks
to those who received him to consecrate the birth of his empire. Do the rich of
the earth not seek, and at great cost, to give to their guests, on the
anniversary of their birth, selected and distinguished presents? It is
therefore an insult to God to think that he has made no new and extraordinary
grace to those whom he has invited to this great and new solemnity worthy of
all the praises of men. Where would be the truth of these words of the Gospel
"He came into his domain, and his people did not receive it? As for those
who received him, he gave them the power to become children of God, to those
who believe in his name, born neither of the blood nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of the Lord, but who are born of God?” (Jn. 1:11, etc.)
How, then, would not God have showered extraordinary graces on those who
believed in Jesus Christ, since He gave them the power to become children of
God, that is, to say the brethren of his own Son, not from the will of the
flesh, nor from man, but from God Himself. If it is claimed that men had
already received this precious gift, then the advent of Jesus Christ on earth
was for men the principle of no new grace. Adam's creation was carnal and
earthly, not spiritual. He was not born of God without the help of flesh and
blood, since God made him of earth; He could not, therefore, receive the Holy
Spirit, because he was not spiritual, and had not been given to call God his
father in prayer. On the contrary, those who have received the Holy Spirit
receive at the same time the inseparable power of the Holy Spirit who is in
them, to call God in their prayers the father of the Christians. Now, as the
righteous of the old law did not have this privilege, they had not received the
Holy Spirit either. So those who claim that Adam or the righteous have had the
Holy Spirit, do not know the price of the grace that God has given them, and
they are unable to render him worthy deeds of grace, since they are filled with
his the most precious gifts they say have received nothing more than those who
lived under the old law.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

one God in three persons was to be announced to men. The Trinity had been
preached from the beginning, but the intelligence remained as veiled. The
person of the Father was first announced and manifested with complete clarity
and without figure, because he is the principle of all things. As for the

unbelievers raise reckless questions about Our Lord and the Holy Spirit. there
are even those who push the absurdity to the point of maintaining that the Holy

by the very fact that they have the Spirit of God in them. It is a mark of
perfection to know the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is this
perfection that gets us this gift. And then, the Son of God coming to the earth
to reveal and discover these truths, had to pour out more abundant graces on
men, and it was right that he gives this perfection to the souls who believed
in him, for this not in the Son or in the Father, considered in isolation, is
salvation, but in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is
what makes St. John the evangelist say: "And we have all received of his
fullness, and grace for grace: for the law was given by Moses, grace and truth
came from Jesus Christ.” (Jn. 1:16) It is certain that at the advent of the
Savior, the truth has come to its fullness. This fullness of truth was produced
by the revelation of all the hidden mysteries that God had promised to manifest
to men. It was then that the faithful became the children of God through the
reception of the Holy Spirit, and the inspiration of God over Adam is to be
understood from the soul he gave him because in Scripture the mind is
frequently used for the soul, especially in this passage of the Gospel:
"And her spirit returned to her," (Luke 8:55) and in the Psalm:
"God does not despise a spirit broken by pain and a contrite and
humiliated heart." (Ps. 50:19) frequently found in some manuscripts,
instead of God inspired, this other variant: "God poured on his face a
breath of life, and the man had a living soul." The spirit of life in the
thought of the sacred author is therefore not synonymous with the Holy Spirit,
for he says also in speaking of animals: "Who had the spirit of life.” (Gen.
7:22) But it is called the spirit of life, because it is for the bodies a
principle of life.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
</span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— It is no doubt, no doubt, that this world was
created for man; although it is composed of varied substances, it nevertheless
forms but one body having several members, the combined action of which is
intended to produce all the things necessary to man. It was like a house built
for man with the provisions he needed, provisions that the earth had to produce
each according to its kind, that is to say, that by the fact of their creation
they had been able to reproduce each according to its species. God created the
primitive types whose seed was to serve in turn the multiplication of species
on earth. This is the result of these words of the Scripture: "And God
blessed them, saying, Be multiplied and multiply on earth (Gen. 1:28)." He
also blesses the human race, and we see the same meaning reproduced in the book
of the law. We read in it: "The people grew and multiplied in Egypt (Acts
7:17).” The blessing which God had given to the things he had created for the
benefit of man was also given to man, so that mankind grew and multiplied the
union of man and woman. And just as culture had to improve the seeds, so the
human race had to do all its care so that the knowledge of God would help her
to lead her life, to render pleasing to God and to relate all things to
admiration and praise the glory of his Creator. Whether it is the meaning of
these words, the facts themselves attest, for all things which have been
created multiply and improve upon the earth by the will of God. Indeed, one
cannot suppose any other mode of development than that which God has
established for his seeds. How, then, can we attribute an evil origin, or an
illicit character, to that which develops only under the influence of the blessings
of God and of his will? The tradition of this blessing has always remained in
the synagogue and is still in use today in the Church which consecrates by the
blessing of God the union of its creatures. And there is no presumption here on
his part since the form of this blessing comes from the Creator himself. If it
is thought that this blessing must cease one day, it can only be when the
things which multiply under this blessing cease to exist, for if the generation
of men ceases, what would be the usefulness of creatures who have received the
blessing of God to multiply on the earth? The world cannot be partly in action,
partly in rest; or it acts wholly, or it remains wholly in rest. What utility
would be a body, some of whose members would have life, while others would be
struck with apathy? How then do some go so far as to represent as profane and
unclean the work which has been consecrated by the blessing of God, except that
they wish to attack God Himself? They would find nothing to be recaptured in
the work if the false and evil ideas of the artisan were not formed. They do
not dare openly to God, they find the means of accusing him in his works. When
the work displeases, the blame falls on its author. If these critical spirits
read or rather received the Scriptures, they would recall the saying of Balaam:
"Can I curse him whom God has blessed (Num. 23:8)?” There is no charge
against the approval of the judge, and one condemns oneself when one wants to
accuse as guilty the one whom the laws themselves protect. Who, then, are you
who believe that you can condemn what God has blessed as the Scriptures teach
you? You must either deny that he is God, or that you should be contrary to
Scripture. Indeed, it is under the pretext that they receive the New Testament
that they ought to reject the ancient Scriptures. Now the new precepts which
Jesus Christ imposes on the faithful are not in contradiction with the
ancients. The Savior himself has not disdained to reply to the invitation which
he was made to attend a wedding; and not only did he honor them with his
presence, but he even gave the spouses what was lacking in the joy of the feast
(Jn. 2:1), for it is written that wine rejoices the heart of man (Ps. 103:15).
And to show that he did nothing but the will of his Father, the Jews having
asked him whether it was permissible for a man to return his father, He said to
them, "From the beginning of the world God made man and woman, and said
unto them, For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be
joined to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh (Matt. 19:3-6).
Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. So let not man separate what
God adds. This was why he gladly surrendered to the invitation to attend the
meetings, he would not appear to condemn what God his Father had instituted.
Wishing, on the contrary, to show the harmony of the old law and of the new
law, he not only did not proscribe marriage, but deigned to honor it by his
presence, to render him the testimony of his divine institution, and by a most
salutary commandment declared that they should neither defend nor separate what
God had united. It is also to raise the utility of the birth of man, that on
the point of leaving this world, he confided his mother to his disciple John
(Jn. 19:26). It is for the same reason that the precepts of the old law and of
the new law agree to recommend that we honor our parents under pain of curses
if we breach this commandment. What then is this presumption, and on what law
is it based to proscribe the marriage so clearly authorized by the old as by
the new law? We may apply to him these words of the Savior: "That which is
without is from evil (Matt. 5:37).” Thus the Apostle reproaches himself with
having a cauterized conscience to those men who forbid marriage, and the use of
the foods that God created to be eaten with actions of graces. (I Tim. 4:2.) It
is an act on their part, both of hypocrisy and of hostility, whose object is to
accuse the law of which God is the author. Others seem to receive the precepts
of salvation with eagerness only to support the prescriptions of their doctrine
of falsehood, and this is why the Apostle reproaches them for having a closed
conscience. Indeed, the corruption of their hearts makes them manifest outside
feelings different from what they think internally: they resemble the Jews who
knew that the miracles of the Savior were works of the Holy Spirit and that
they did not say a feeling of jealousy that it was in the name of Beelzebub
that he cast out demons (Matt. 12:24, Lk. 11:15), to divert the people from
believing in him. Such is also the deceit of those of whom we have spoken; in
the name of the holiness and chastity with which they boast of being the
partisans, they maintain that marriage must be condemned, seeking to make
itself valued and to divert the people from truth; It is thus also that they
recommend the abstinence of certain foods to give themselves falsely as models
of temperance which, strangers to the world, hasten to reach the kingdom of heaven.
After they have thus seduced the spirits of men, they preach the legitimacy of
the most reprehensible acts and condemn the use of permissible things. Such are
the wiles of Satan, he inverts the roles and in the form of a novelty he
excludes truth which is nothing new because it is wholly eternal. Who does not
notice that such is the conduct adopted by our enemies? Who, moreover, would
dare to condemn a divine institution which has never been injurious to anyone
but the enemy of truth? In order to cover his disorders, he preaches the
sanctity which he dislikes, and when he has thus become a zealous supporter of
good, he teaches that the most culpable acts are permitted. It makes itself
worth to deceive more easily and to suggest to the imprudent ones who fall into
its traps more enormous sins. It is a remedy, it seems to his own evils, to
incite men to excess crimes; he regards it as a great consolation to have many
accomplices, and regards his punishment as lighter and more tolerable if he
succeeds in drawing a large number with him into hell blind men who are
overcome by their vices excuse themselves for their weakness or ignorance, and
do not think of punishing the faults on which concupiscence deceives them. Or
what is this cloud that conceals from them the knowledge of truth? For the
letters appear to have a different signification, when they are badly
pronounced, or are not properly distinguished; but when one reads: God has
done, and again: God has blessed what he has done, can it remain matter either
to the discussion or to the slightest doubt? Who will dare to see the curse
instead of the blessing, unless animated by a hostile spirit? If these words
were the words of man, perhaps one might fear some ploy, but it is God who
speaks, and you doubt? It is God blessed, and you condemn? But was not Moses
under the name of God the author of this error? The miracles and wonders which
Moses made in Egypt are an answer to this question, and the wonders he has done
in the Red Sea for the deliverance of the children of Israel must suffice to
persuade you. Listen to the confession made by the magicians: "The finger
of God is here (Exod. 8:19).” Believe in the testimony of the Apostle, who said
to you, "I do not want you to be ignorant, my brothers, that our fathers
were all under the cloud, that they all passed through and they were all
baptized under the guidance of Moses in the cloud and in the sea, that they all
ate the same mysterious meat, and that they drank the same mysterious drink,
for they drank the water of the spiritual stone, the water which followed them,
and this stone was Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 10:1, 4).” And how did the Apostle
speak in this way? The answer is in the Scriptures, where we read that Our Lord
Jesus Christ said to the Jews, "If you believed in Moses, you would
doubtless believe me too, for it is from me that he wrote (Jn. 5:46)." Who
could not believe in such a beautiful harmony, who would dare to see
contradiction in such a perfect unity, who would be badly inspired to accuse of
hostility so close a union? The testimony of the words, and the examples of the
miracles which must submit your mind to the truth, and prevent you from
considering as true any doctrine which is not contained in the books of the
Catholic Church of the Old Testament is the same as ours, and that a thousand
brilliant signs proclaim that it is the only true one, its authority must be so
great to us that even if a thing should appear to us too harsh or even absurd,
accept, reform on this our personal ideas before the judgment of God who
apprehends it, for we must believe in God rather than ourselves. Indeed, our
weakness and inexperience often regard as useful what is most injurious to us,
and takes the false for truth, which we cannot even suspect of God; its nature
is inaccessible to error; it is not permissible for us to doubt the legitimacy
of marriage before these words of God: "Let not man divide what God has
united (Matt. 19:6: Mk. 10:9).” This is a thing as clear as it is simple. It is
certain that every man has reason to rejoice at having been the object of the
goodness of God, and that he thinks he is better when he learns to know the
sacrament of his Creator, which he would not be able to achieve if he had not
been born. Why, then, deplore what makes the subject of his joy, and condemn
what he glories of having learned?<span>  </span></font><font size="3">If he
rejoices at having learned, and if, moreover, he could not learn unless he was
born; no doubt it is good to be born, since the fruit of birth is the knowledge
of the truth. If, on the contrary, it is an evil to be born, knowledge cannot
be good. To what purpose can this knowledge be used if the birth is condemned?
If it is neither useful nor necessary to be born, why should he who is
condemned seek to learn? But as there is no mind stupid enough to deny that
knowledge of God is useful to men, it is necessary to recognize its goodness,
its utility. It is she who adds a new perfection to birth, so that she deserves
more than Adam had received, for it is in heaven and not on earth that the faithful
are called to reign, the paradise of God the Father, and not in that where Adam
had been ordered to engage in bodily labor. In Jerusalem there was celebrated
the feast called encaenia, that is to say, the dedication of the temple of God,
how much more must we celebrate the birth of man, who is much more
appropriately called the temple of God, and who has himself constructed with
his hands to God the temples to give him thanksgiving? Our body is a much more
excellent temple, because it is the work of God, and the material temples are
the work of man, that one has the hope of eternity, while the others are
destined for a certain ruin. He who acknowledges that it was God who gave birth
to him to give thanks, and who has come to know his mysteries, must rejoice on
the anniversary of his birth by seeing the precious fruits which he has
produced. As for those who abandon their Creator and offer to others the glory
which is due to them, it would have been better for them never to be born, for
their birth can only turn to their misfortune, and yet the fault is not with
birth, but to their will. But who are you, you who pretend to forbid marriage?
You may be, Marcion, who maintain that the body is not the work of God but of
the devil, and that it is in consequence of some fault that the soul fell from
its first state descended into this region of darkness where the world is. Now
how could it attain its deliverance if the generation is forbidden to it? It is
after your birth that you experienced your downfall and that you have taken the
means to return to the fatherland and resume your original destiny. You give
thanks to Jesus Christ, by whom you are glad to have obtained this knowledge.
Now, if you were not born, all knowledge would have been impossible, and consequently
all deliverance. If you rejoice in the deliverance of your soul, be favorable
to your birth, for if you condemn it, you are the enemy of souls. Or are you a
Manichean, who rejects the marriages as evil? I will then ask you if there was
no generation of bodies, how could the soul, which you say is spread in a dark
region and closely united to the material elements, be delivered? The book you
wrote say that it is by birth that the soul is delivered, that is to say that
the souls received by the moon are coming out of their bodies transmitted to
the sun which you claim to be the God of your souls. And is it not fortunate
for you to bear the name of Manicheans? Indeed, it is in this capacity that you
solicit your deliverance, which you would not know if you were not born. It is
therefore evident that you condemn marriage by hypocrisy. You make an outward
profession of chastity, and you give yourself up in secret to all kinds of
impurities, which have not been hidden, but which have been revealed by the very
edicts of the emperors. Listen now, you who are a Catholic, and learn from the
Gospel how useful it is to the man of valor. When the righteous Simeon wished
to leave this life, convinced that it was enough for him to know his Creator
without knowing the mystery of his incarnation, God did not accede to his
desire until he had arrived at this perfect state for to obtain the full and
entire reward of his faith. It was then that he took in his arms the Savior who
had just been born and blessed God in these terms: "Lord, you will now let
your servant go in peace according to your word, for my eyes have seen your
salvation (Lk. 2:29).” It was clear to God that it was good for man to be born,
since it was answered to that righteous man who desired death that he would not
die before he had seen the Christ of the Lord; for he had made such great
progress here below, that he was worthy to see in this life the man he hoped
for as his deliverer after his death. Now, how can we say that birth was not a
useful thing for this man to whom God extended his life and allowed him to die
only when he had seen the fruit of his hope, and which he would be sure to see
for himself life to succeed him? If it were an evil for us to be born, it is
neither paradise, nor eternal life, nor the kingdom of heaven promised us, but
the punishments and chastisements of hell that we should expect. The man who
knew that he was born for his loss would fear to transmit life to another, and
he who knew that his birth was a guilty act would not seek to revive in his
children. They will say to me, "Yes, the kingdom of heaven is promised,
but to the faithful men who have done good." Perfectly, therefore, you see
that men are not guilty by the sole fact of their birth, but because they have
done evil; for it is not to those who are not born that the kingdom of heaven
is promised, which would make birth a cause of exclusion, but to those who
after their birth do good; that is to say, birth cannot be useful to the child
he that does evil, and hurts him that does good. The faithful and the good men
add to the perfection of their birth, the infidels and the unbelievers make
their lose her. Birth is like a tree that is grafted; if the graft is good, the
tree will become better and be called a good tree; if the graft is bad, it will
become worse than it was and deserve to be called a bad tree. Thus, if a sound
doctrine is joined at birth, it will produce good fruits, but if the doctrine
is bad, the fruits will be equally bad. Just as the tree must exist beforehand
so that it can be grafted, birth is also necessary in order to make progress
good. But we are made of this body: If it is good and useful to be born, why do
we need to be reborn? This rebirth would not take place if birth was not
useful. The soul is to be renewed, and those that are renewed are completely
repaired. This rebirth is not, therefore, opposed to birth, it is reform, and
what is reformed proves by the same the perfection of its first state. This
rebirth is a transformation which is the effect of a voluntary resolution, and
which purifies the defilements of the body to restore us to the primitive state
in which Adam was created. The soul has communicated to the body the
defilements of his sin, but faith repairs it, renders it more perfect and cleanses
it in the waters of baptism; the contempt of God had tainted him, obedience
purified him, he thus avoided the sentence pronounced against Adam and acquired
the right to the glorious resurrection. If, then, it is by the soul that sin
began, why should we accuse the nature of the body, since in the sin of Adam it
is not the body that has desired, but the soul seduced by hope of the divinity,
who transgressed the precept, cast the body into the bondage of sin, and
condemned all men to be born slaves to sin? Now this sin does not harm the man
who obeys the law of God, except that he is subject to death; but here again
the goodness of God has promised him a reward proportionate with that
punishment, that is, those who will be found faithful to their Creator, and
whom the sins of Adam condemn to corruption and death, will receive in return
from the righteous judge more than God had granted to Adam; they will be
covered with glory in heaven and will possess eternal life, and will be called
the adopted sons of God, so that it is truly a gain for them to be born. I now
follow the passage from which we read: "God said to man, You may eat of
all the fruit of the garden, but you do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil (Gen. 2:16-17).” All the trees of which God speaks here are the
fruits destined to be made the food of the creatures. They are given here the
general name of trees, but there is a great variety in the fruits. They are
all, however, trees and plants, and there is only one kind of food in spite of
the diversity of fruits used to the food of man. When God had created this
multitude of fruit trees for the nourishment of man, he forbade him, as I have
said, to eat the fruit of a single tree. As our first parents had been
empowered over all things, it was fitting that they should give God on one
point a testimony of submission and respect. He had therefore reserved a single
tree to which he had forbidden them to touch, to remind them of their
condition. How can the sentence pronounced against them make us understand what
was the nature of their fault? This sentence, in fact, can be pronounced both
against a homicide, against a malefactor, an adulteress, an infamous one. (Josh.
17:1, etc.). How, then, to judge according to this sentence of the nature of
sin, is to be condemned after his sin to be consumed by fire, and all his
family. It can be assumed that sin was great, but not what its nature was, for
we know that others were condemned to the same punishment, although their fault
was different. Amorites and the inhabitants of Sodom perished, and their
children, and we see men guilty of the same crime, punished with various
punishments, with one and the same sentence pronounced against those whose
crimes are quite different, and of Eve cannot be known by the sentence
pronounced against them. The sin of man and woman is the same, it is true, yet
both were condemned to a particular and individual punishment, as was the
serpent. Not only did they not preserve the prerogatives of their former state,
but God imposed upon them labor as the punishment of their crime. God, as the
book of Genesis tells us, had subjected all animals and all living beings to
man (Gen. 1:26). The serpent rose up against this order, and so much by his
cunning and his artifices that he enslaved man to his empire. No doubt, indeed,
he who makes someone fall into his traps, submits him to his dominion. But God
did not wish that he should receive the fruits of his deceit; he humbled and
shamed him below his first condition, that he might not rise above man, leaves
him only the pain, not only of not having succeeded in his designs, but of
having lost the perfection of his creation. It was, says the sacred author, the
most of all the animals God had placed on earth; but after he had deceived the
man, he was cursed among all the beasts and creatures of the earth. After the
sentence pronounced against man, against woman, against the serpent, the woman,
who had been the accomplice of man in contempt of the divine command, was to be
subjected to a particular punishment. God said to her, "I will multiply
your calamities, your childbirth, you will give birth in sorrow, your desires
will turn to your husband, and he will rule over you (Gen. 3:16.).” No one
confirms himself what he condemns. If children were granted to the woman
because she had united herself to the man against the order of God, then a
guilty act must be recognized as having wonderful effects. But if you believe
that the principle of the generation of men is in these words: "You will
be grieved in sorrow," what did these words mean: "Increase and
multiply”? This sentence, "Ye shall bear in sorrow," is therefore
only a punishment, that is to say, that what had previously been granted to him
as a cause of joy will become a sin source of sorrows; and that this punishment
should cease to weigh upon the woman, God adds that her desires will turn to
her husband, and will be for her a principle of ever-new sorrows. If God
condemned the union of man and woman, why did he say to her: "Will your
desires turn to your husband?” No one establishes as punishment what he
condemns as reprehensible, since punishment must always be opposed to the crime
he punishes, and that it must come from a very different principle. If the
fault and the punishment come from the same principle, no one would be afraid
of being condemned. One might even say that the transgression of the law
becomes a laudable act. Far from punishing sin, God would have confirmed it, if
the desires of the woman had turned to her husband only because of her sin. But
no, the truth is that this union of woman with man, which had been merely
permissible before sin, was then imposed upon her with the bondage of
childbirth as a punishment, because man had been left to rule by the woman whom
God had given her as companion. It is evident that he had been subject by the
woman whose counsels had led her to believe in the hopes she had given him, and
which were intended only to destroy the work of God by the ploys of the devil.
God, by his sentence, therefore returns the wife to the condition of
subjugation which subjects her to her husband, according to the first
institution, and adds, as a punishment: "I will multiply your calamities
and your movements; you will turn to your husband, and he will rule over
you." Had God established the woman in a state which was not a state of
submission to her husband? The woman is therefore recalled here to this first
state with the addition we have pointed out. That is why God said to her,
"I will set the height of your sorrows and your groans.” Putting the end
is adding to what is incomplete, not establishing or doing what does not. The
words of God that precede: "Rise and multiply," (Gen. 1:22, 28) are
not for creation but for the loss of creatures to whom God conceded existence.
After sin, God adds to the pain and difficulties of woman's birth, but does not
establish a new form of procreation. If these words have really been the
principle of generation, it must be attributed rather to the will of the devil
than to that of the Lord, for there is, as the Savior declares, a race of
vipers. (Matt. 3:7) Now, if anyone thinks he was born in this way, let him
consider what he deserved. It was because of her sin that she saw the pangs of
childbirth increase, and that this grief, which was at first sight, increased
in punishment for the sins of her children; for it is in the groans and tears
that she gives birth to them, and scarcely have they been born, that they
become for her a permanent cause of sadness. Thirdly, let us see the sentence
pronounced against the man: "Because you have listened to your wife's
voice, and have eaten the fruit of the tree which I have forbidden you to eat,
the earth will be cursed because of what you have done, and you will not eat of
its fruits, in all the days of your life but with great labor, it will produce
for you only thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18).” Adam is also recalled to the
state in which he was created, but with a decrease of his privileges. God had
first placed him in the earthly paradise to simply cultivate the earth and see
at once the fruit of his work. But scarcely has he despised the divine
commandment, in the hope of finding in the council of the serpent a fate more
fortunate than that which God had given him, God recalls him to his first
condition, but by adding to it sweat and fatigue; the earth will no longer
respond to his labors, it will be cursed not for it, but because of its works.
God thus shows that His designs cannot be destroyed and that no one can show
greater providence. No one, in fact, can love the work of another more strongly
than the one who is the author of it, to the apostle's testimony: "Never
has anyone hated his own flesh; nourishes and cares for her, like Jesus Christ
the Church (Eph. 5:29).” Let us now see whether the continuation of the
historical facts of the law agrees with its beginnings. Abraham having been
pleasing to God, among other rewards of his faith, was judged worthy to beget a
son in his old age. How, then, can we attack and condemn what God grants as a
reward? That is to say, that Abraham having obeyed the divine will, sees God
fulfill his own will, which could not have been done if this will was not
innocent, for God would not have granted a request or bad or unintelligent,
especially in with respect to him who was pleasing to him; a man himself would
not act in this way. A man who was barren and loved God with all his heart,
asked for a son and obtained it. Now, if this request were guilty, the God whom
he loved should have warned him not to make a request contrary to the good. (I
Kgs. 1:2) Samuel, his son, of such eminent sanctity, had children in his turn,
but the merit of his justice was not diminished. On the contrary, his virtue
never ceased to increase since his first years, and he received from God in his
old age the most striking testimony. The priest Zechariah, a righteous man,
also had in his old age, by the will of God, a son who had the gift of prophecy
even before his birth (Lk. 1:5). What is the reason why we are accused of what
everyone agrees to present as advantageous? How can one deny that one must call
good and useful something that does not harm anyone? And to speak here a little
of the apostles and to make them serve for the direct defense of this cause,
St. John was certainly a faithful observer of chastity; but we know that his
colleague in the apostolate, that is, St. Peter, had a wife, and that the
children she gave him were not an obstacle to the primacy he received from the
other apostles. How then can we condemn what can be reconciled with the
greatest merits? Thus the apostle St. Paul teaches that he who has a wife, if
he observes the commandments, can and must be raised to the priesthood. If
marriage were unlawful, he would not have declared that a sinner should receive
the priesthood. And what is more evident? Is it not the same Apostle who says:
"As for the virgins, I have not received a commandment from the Lord (1
Cor. 7:25)?” The heretics notice trouble and agitation among the Corinthians,
by hypocritically teaching that marriage should be condemned; they therefore
consulted the Apostle by letters, to ascertain whether it was lawful to marry,
or whether to send his wife away. It is then that St. Paul commands the woman
not to separate herself from her husband, although it would have been the
occasion, if he had been convinced that this was the true doctrine, to say that
it was forbidden to marry, just as he declares that he cannot impose as a
precept what he has received no command from the Lord. Who, on the contrary,
does not hear him preach loudly: ‘I want young widows to marry and have
children?’ But, I am told, if it is lawful, if it is advantageous to marry, why
is it not permissible for priests to have their wives, that is to say, why is
it forbidden for them to have relations with her after their ordination? Who
knows that each state has its own laws? There are things that are generally
prohibited at all; there are some who are permitted to one and forbidden to
others; there are some which are sometimes defended and sometimes permitted.
Fornication is forbidden to all without exception; but trade is sometimes
permitted and sometimes defended. Before entering the ecclesiastical state, a
man is permitted to trade, but he can no longer do so as soon as he is a part
of it. In the same way, it is sometimes permissible, sometimes forbidden for a
Christian to have relations with his wife. Thus, in the days of public
supplication, it is his duty to separate from his wife, because he must abstain
even from the things permitted to obtain more easily what he asks of God. For
this reason the Apostle recommends abstaining for one time from the use of the
marriage of the consent of one and the other, in order to attend to prayer.
According to the law, wars and lawsuits are prohibited on fasting days, and are
permitted on other days to show greater respect for the things of God. Is all
that is permitted before other men equally before the person of the sovereign?
How much more must we observe this rule in the things of God? The priest
consecrated to him must therefore be purer than other men; he represents him,
he is his vicar, and what is permitted to others is forbidden to him, because
he must fulfill every day the functions of Jesus Christ himself, that is to say
pray for the people, offer the sacrifice, or administer baptism. It is not only
to the priest that the use of marriage is forbidden, but also to his minister,
for he must be all the purer as the mysteries of which he is the minister are
more holy. Just as in the presence of a torch darkness appears not only
obscure, but hideous, as compared with the stars the flame itself loses its
brightness, the stars compared to the sun become dark, the sun compared to God
is more than a dark night; thus things which are lawful and pure to us become
illicit and impure in the presence of the dignity of God, for all the good they
are, they are not suitable to the divine majesty. Would not the tunic of an
obscure man, no matter how clean, be a scoundrel unbecoming the person of the
emperor? Is it not the same with the tunic of the Saxons for a senator? For the
same reason the priests of God must be more chaste than other men, because they
represent the person of Jesus Christ, and the purity of the ministers of God
must be greater. Nobody comes to fulfill his office near the emperor, except in
a perfectly neat exterior, with clothes of brilliant cleanliness. Now, God, who
by his nature is light itself, demands that his ministers be pure in their
conscience rather than in their garments; to him praise and glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

31. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS A SERPENT
WHO SPOKE WITH THE WOMAN, OR IS IT THE VERY ACT OF THE DEVIL WHO HAS SEDUCED
HER, WHO HAS GIVEN HER THE NAME OF SERPENT? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— If we keep to the historical
narrative, it is true that the serpent was the finest of all the animals that
the Lord God had formed on earth. Besides, it is against the serpent that God
has pronounced his sentence. What, indeed, would it be astonishing that the
devil was finer than the animals, the Apostle of whom said, "Do you not
know the depths of Satan (2 Cor. 2:11)?” Another proof that it was a true
serpent is that God said to him, "You shall crawl on your stomach, and you
shall eat of the earth all the days of your life (Gen. 3:14).” This punishment
is in no way suited to the nature of Satan, since he is neither clothed in body
nor subject to death. If we examine things more closely, we shall see that this
sentence did not aggravate the condition of the serpent, and that it was
condemned to remain in the state in which God had created it. He had been the
instrument of Satan to subdue the man to whom God had subjected everything; for
this reason God represses the pride of the serpent by that subjugation in which
he had placed all creatures before man, because he had been a minister of pride
to man. The man appeared to have submitted to the serpent, following the advice
which he gave him of transgressing the law which he had imposed upon him. The
Lord Himself testifies to the prudence of serpents, when he says, "Be
careful as serpents (Matt. 10:16)." It is therefore well established that
the serpent truly spoke with Eve; it now remains for us to examine whether he
has been sufficiently sly and cunning enough to deceive her. For if it were
finer than other animals, it could be no more than men, since no animal is
endowed with reason, except man. It is impossible, therefore, that the serpent
should be the author of these subtle insinuations; let him be in good health,
but his finesse cannot go beyond his nature. It cannot deliberate, reflect, or
take advice. It is therefore certain that it was the devil, who in the form of
the serpent, sought to seduce the woman. By slipping into the form of the
serpent, he used it as an instrument, so that the woman, who knew the serpent's
fineness, could not suspect the cunning of the demon hiding in this form. Hence
the sentence of condemnation carried out against the serpent, falls spiritually
upon Satan, because the sentence must reach the true culprit. This sentence
does not come from man, who by error or malice might condemn an ​​innocent man;
it comes from God who is infallible, and whose judgment reaches only the one
guilty. Satan, though invisible, makes his snares outwardly; the sentence of
condemnation is pronounced externally, but it falls spiritually upon him whose
crime has necessitated the sentence. Indeed, Satan, that audacious and impure
spirit, has been thrown from the sacred dwelling of heaven and condemned to
crawl and groan on earth. I may be asked in what language the serpent spoke to
the woman; I answer, in the language of the serpent. If there are any, who now
understand the signification of the barking of dogs, the howling of wolves, the
cries of elephants, the chanting of cocks, why the woman who then had no less
intelligence, could not she have understood the snake's throat, when we know
many who understand the signification of the song of the birds? It is certain
that the devil used the tongue of the one in whose body he had entered,
otherwise he could not have deceived the woman. He therefore spoke the language
of the serpent which he had chosen as his instrument.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

God in creating man had given him the privilege of immortality supposed that he
would not sin. He had to be for himself the author of life or death. If he
avoided sin, he would enjoy immortality as the fruit of his labor; but if he
was unfaithful to his duty, he could only blame himself for being subject to
death. As long as he persevered in obedience to the Creator's mind, he was
worthy to feed on the fruit of the tree of life, which preserved him from
death; for his body was not by its nature immune to dissolution, it was the
virtue of the tree of life which preserved it from corruption. I will say that
even after sin he could have remained incorruptible if it had been allowed to
eat from the tree of life. But how to admit an immortal body for whom food is a
necessary support? An immortal being does not need to eat or drink. Food gave
him strength, but the tree of life, by a kind of medicinal virtue, removed from
him any element of corruption. Thus, it was for man an impenetrable wall to

5.</font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> WHY WAS THE SACRIFICE OF ABEL
APPROVED OF GOD, AND THAT OF CAIN REFUSED? </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">— One can conclude from the terms
alone of this narrative that the truth of history is not veiled by any literary
artifice. The Holy Scripture tells us here clearly that Abel was prudent and
religious, while Cain was negligent and careless, and by the same had much less
religion. Abel therefore chooses the best sheep of his flock to offer them to
his Creator. By offering God the first fruits of the possessions he had made,
he testified of God's excellence and deep submission, he testified his feelings
of respect and adoration, and acknowledged that God was the author of all
things. Cain, guided by coarser sentiments, could not offer God a similar
sacrifice. When he was plunged into the things of the earth, he could not raise
the eyes of his soul to heaven to consider what might be worthy of his Creator,
and he offered to God the most common fruits of the earth. It is in this also
that the Jews lacked righteousness. For the Lord has often reproached them that
they are inconsiderately charging on his altar victims even unworthy of being
offered to men. "You offer me," said he, "sightless or blind
victims, I will not receive them from your hands; Offer them to your master or
chief if they please him. (Mal. 1:8)” Everyone agrees, indeed, that one must
offer what is most excellent to a person of higher dignity. The Lord therefore
rejected Cain's gifts and said to him, "Why are you angry and why is your
face sad? If you do your offering with righteousness, but you do not have it in
the choice of your gifts, you sin. Stay at rest. Your offering comes to you and
you are the master of it. (Gen. 4:6). You see that it was the choice of the
gift which rendered it, usable. He was not able to discern what was worthy of
God, and reserved the best fruits for his use. It is not therefore the offering
he has made that God reproaches Cain, but the unworthy presents he offers him.
And he is not even condemned for this fact, but because in spite of this
warning he would not correct his conduct. "This offering comes to you, and
you are the master of it,” (Ibid., 7), that is, those gifts that I reject
become your property again. He wants to teach him what to do in the future.
Cain conceived a violent jealousy against his brother. This man of iniquity put
to death the first righteous man, and thus gave men the example of crime. In
fact, this profound jealousy blinded him to the point that not only did he not
give thanks to God, who, far from punishing him as guilty, taught him to
correct his conduct, but that he fell into a far more enormous crime which
attracted his just condemnation. The imprudent conduct of the Cain fratricide
resembles that of that wretched servant, who, ungrateful for the forgiveness he
had just received from his master, wanted to acquit his companion, and thus
deserved to be condemned without excuse, and for the fault which had been
forgiven him, and for his cruelty to his fellowman (Matt. 18:28). Nevertheless,
Cain was not condemned at once; he was left on earth to be confounded and terrified
by his crime, and to facilitate the way of repentance and forgiveness. And as
he was afraid of being put to death for the crime he had committed, he said to
the Lord, "<i>My iniquity is too great
for me to be forsaken; If you reject me today from the face of the earth, I
will escape from all eyes, I will be wandering and groaning on earth, and
whoever finds me will kill me</i></font><font size="3"> (Gen. 4:13).</font><span><font size="3"> 
</font></span><font size="3">Cain, afraid of the condemnation of the just Judge, fears that this
abandonment of the Lord forces him to flee the eyes of men, certain that it is
that he who has against him an angry God must fear to be put to death by the
men. But what does the Lord answer? "It will not be so," said he,
"that is to say, I will not let you go, you who do not deserve to live,
that you may fall under the blows of your likes, but so that you may spend your
life in groans, in fear, and in alarms, as a punishment for the evil example
which you first gave on earth, and seeing that the earth does not respond by
your productiveness to your labors. </font><i><font size="3">He</font></i><font size="3">,
he adds, </font><i><font size="3">who will kill Cain will be
punished seven times </font></i><font size="3">(Gen. 4:24). This sentence proves the justice of
Cain's condemnation. When he saw this law given with that threatening sanction
which forbade imitation of his criminal conduct, he knew the whole extent of
the crime he had committed, and his fears increased. God threatens to punish
seven times as great a punishment, so that by understanding how great the crime
of Cain was before the promulgation of a positive law, he knew that he was
incurring punishment seven times more severe if he was guilty of it, that is to
say that knowledge of the law would add six degrees more to the punishment
which Cain had deserved, and that this punishment would be literally sevenfold.
This same number also represents the reward of those who have left everything
to follow the Lord, and who, in addition, will receive eternal life in the
other world. This is the sign that the Lord put on Cain, </font><i><font size="3">so that whoever would find him would not </font></i><font size="3">do so (Ibid. 15). By
virtue of this law which has been brought against the murder, every man who has
committed a murder, because all murder is a homicide, would be seven times more
guilty than Cain. God wanted the fear of such severe punishment to stop those
who would be tempted to commit such a crime. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THINK? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—</span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">
</span></font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is a false opinion
based on what Lamech says of Cain, <i>I
killed a man who hurt me, a young man who covered me with wounds</i></font><font size="3">. For
Lamech was born of the fifth generation after Cain, that is, of Methuselah, the
great grandson of Cain. Lamech recalls this fact to show that a much more
rigorous punishment was reserved for those who would bound since the
promulgation of the law. If, then, after Cain, the punishment has been
sevenfold for the imitator of his crime, how much more severe will this
chastisement be for that which neither the crime of Cain nor the severe
reproaches addressed to him, nor the sentence pronounced against him may have
diverted from a crime in which impiety is joined to cruelty. Lamech has
committed this homicide after Cain, and without a doubt, from what we have
said. His punishment was seven times more severe. Now what will happen to him
who, after Lamech, will follow his example? He tells us by saying, </font><i><font size="3">I will avenge the death of Lamech seventy
times seven times</font></i><font size="3"> (Gen. 4:24). If this criminal action is not followed by
repentance, it will be punished with a punishment seventy times seven times
more terrible. That is why Our Lord commands to forgive him who has sinned this
same number of times, if he regrets his faults. (Matt. 18:22) But it must not
be believed that another homicide was committed before that of Lamech and after
that of Cain, because Lamech says, </font><i><font size="3">The
murder of Cain was avenged</font></i><font size="3"> (Gen. 4:24 LXX), as if this vengeance was done.
As for Lamech, how could he have said that he had already been the object of
this vengeance, whereas the murder he confessed to have committed was still
recent? It may therefore be said that every crime carries with it its
condemnation. For when there is no other hope, besides that one knows what is
worth an act which is consummated, one considers as already done a thing which
is yet to be done. Finally, it was said to Adam and Eve: </font><i><font size="3">The day that you eat of this fruit, you shall die of death</font></i><font size="3"> (Gen.
2:17), and yet they did not die immediately, but after a long interval of time.
However, since they had already lost the hope of immortality, death, which was
not to strike them until later, was, so to speak, present to them, because it
was then the object of their fears. When, therefore, Lamech confesses to having
killed a young man, since it is certain that Cain could not live until that
time, or that if his life has been prolonged until then, what seems impossible
is then an old man, it is not him that Lamech killed.</font></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">

108. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">OF THE HEBREW LANGUAGE, WHERE DOES
ITS NAME COME FROM. </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
Everything that comes from God is reasonable, and everything has its source in
a cause which is the principle of its origin, which justifies its name and its
existence in the eyes of reason, and presents a designation which is the origin
of the name that it is clothed. The reason for existence of man is therefore
the cause by which it exists. Now it is composed of four elements, the earth,
the air, the water and the fire; the fifth element is the soul, which is like
the conductor and as the king destined to direct the body after its formation
and organization. We derive our origin from the earth, and we bear its name. In
fact, the name of men given to us comes from humus, earth, of which the body of
our first father was formed. There is, therefore, here a cause, a reason for
all those who derive their origin from the same father, to be called by the
same name, and seem to reproduce it in themselves. Let us now see whether it is
right to say as some, that the Hebrews are thus called from Heber from he is
who they descend from. To consider only the name, this opinion would have some
probability, for Heber lived prior to Abraham. If, however, it were true, all
those of the tribe of Heber should have borne this same name to him, for seven
generations separate Hebron from Abraham. (Gen. 11:16, 26) If, then, this name
is prior to Abraham, or Abraham himself was called by that name, then the
Hebrews derive their name from Heber. If, on the contrary, this name was not
used until after Abraham, then it is not from Heber, but from Abraham that the
Hebrews derive their name, since the children of Abraham are the first whom we
see called of that name. Thus, in Genesis, Joseph and his brothers are referred
to as the Hebrews. As it was known that Abraham had come from Syria in the land
of Canaan (Gen. 17:4), that his house had grown there, that in reward of his
law he had been filled with all sorts of goods, that he had been called king,
prophet and father of many nations (Gen. 17:4), that with three hundred and
eighteen men of his servants he had defeated five kings (Gen. 17:4), and that
these events had not taken place in an ignored corner of the earth to remain
forever unknown, the name of Hebrews was given to those who descended from that
race. For all these reasons, Abraham was therefore worthy to become the leader
of those who drew from him their origin. It was by a providential judgment of
God that the chief and stump of the people of God was established in the land
of Canaan, so that all who were born of him in their religion as well as in
their way of life would be quite different then if he had not been himself
before coming into the land of Canaan. God had renewed it entirely, and he
himself had to found a new people in the religion of the true God. This is why
the Apostle St. Paul is glorified to be born a Hebrew of Hebrew fathers (Phil.
3:5); it was for him a title of dignity, a recommendation, and a mark of
nobility, to bear the name of him whom so many virtues had made pleasing to
God, and who was the chief and the stock of his people. Reject this opinion if
it is not conformable to reason, if it is despised if it appears unworthy, if
it is entirely rejected if Abraham is not worthy of this prerogative, as guilty
of flatteries towards him. What is this hostility against Abraham, what is this
rivalry which makes him dispute this glory by his enemies? And who are they, if
not his own children? What have they then to do in Abraham to dispute this
honor? And what have they so much to praise in Heber to judge him worthy of
this prerogative? If we could examine his life, we might find that he worshiped
idols, like Thare and Nachor, and the father of Nahor, who have not lived in a
time far removed from him, and who, according to the testimony of Joshua, have
served the foreign gods. (Josh. 24:2) Let those who support the contrary
opinion tell us the reasons which militate here in favor of Heber, and what are
the merits on which we keep silence; but these merits are void, for the Scriptures
are common to us, and we see clearly what is due to each. If they think they
can defend their opinion by the name alone, it is weak and improbable. The name
of Heber could decide the question here if other testimonies supported this
presumption, for others with the same name could claim this privilege without
any right. The feeling in conformity with the truth is that which is supported
not by name alone, but by solid reasons. Indeed, God having deigned to choose
Abraham to vivify the human race in his person and to propose it to men as an
example to God. follow to reach salvation, he had to repair in him what human
frailty had made them lose. Now it has been proposed as a model in the
resemblance of which the human race was to return to God, and which was to
place men in possession of the true worship of God and of the language which
had been given them in the first place. Adam was at first the image of God, and
it was through him that the knowledge of God was to spread on earth; but after
the ruin of mankind and the forgetting of the true God in which men had fallen,
God made up his image in Abraham so that his faith in the true God would be
fruitful again in abundance. It is not, then, contrary to reason, that the
people who came forth from Abraham owed to him both his origin and his name.
Would the name of Heaven be difficult for them, because it seems to have more
analogy with the word Hebrew, and that the word Hebrews is said, and not
Abraham! Let them observe that the Hebrew language, and not the Hebrews, are
spoken of. If they wish to attack us on this point, they are beaten by their
own weapons, and victory remains undecided between the two parties; it is
reserved for him who will prove the truth of his assertions by good reasons,
for although one is in a position on one point, one loses one's cause if one is
in default on another. We say, therefore, that a letter has been suppressed for
being pleasing to the ear, and that the Hebrews are said to be Hebrew, because
the pronunciation is softer. Thus we do not call the Jews who come from Judah
‘Judah’, but Jews. Everywhere, in fact, where reason requires it, one or more
letters are suppressed or modified to make the pronunciation more agreeable.
Thus, for the middle of the day, we say noon, and likewise in a multitude of
similar cases. It is therefore proper, as we have shown, that the Hebrew people
owe to Abraham his name as well as his language. It is therefore this tongue
which was first given to Adam and to other men, and which to punish it the presumption
which inspired the construction of the tower of Babel was confounded and
divided into several languages, so that it ceased to exist, giving birth by the
change of certain phrases to a multitude of other idioms, which nevertheless
had the same expression. As to this primitive language, it was not entirely
lost, but it was confused in the other languages. God then confounded the
language of men to prevent them from understanding each other and to engage in
more reckless excesses (Gen. 11:8). There were, then, as many tongues as there
were divisions among men; each division established a different language in the
country it inhabited. If we do not wish to admit that it is this language
which, according to Scripture, was the only one spoken among men, it remains
for us only that is, it was formed in detail of the other languages ​​and
reduced to a single idiom used by Abraham. As he was to be the father of a
great number of nations, he spoke a language composed of many languages, and
thus was the object of a general renewal. When those who are represented in the
book of Genesis as having only one language, and the same manner of speaking
from the East to scatter all over the face of the earth, preserve the use of
the primitive language. (Gen. 10:31; 11:1) Indeed, this language given to the
first man in paradise is spoken in no other country as any other language
except by the Jews. And after the confusion of languages, we no longer find the
trace of the language we call Hebrew. If, therefore, this language is not found
in any country, or in any people, and Abraham was a native of Syria, whence
came this language that he spoke, he or his descendants, if it were not the
first, at least it was formed of several languages? Some languages, indeed,
have similar expressions. But this hypothesis does not satisfy reason as that
which holds that this language is the first, for reason shows the providential
design of this fact. In this way, Abraham had to speak the language spoken by
the first man so that Moses, in his history of the creation of the world and of
man, used the same language that God used when he gave the first man the name
of Adam and the first woman the name of Eve. It was fitting that the account of
Moses should be written in the language of those whose origin he tells us to
teach as God had resumed his first designs and renewed the effects of his mercy
in the person of Abraham.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">ON ABRAHAM. </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
The faith of this patriarch was so perfect and so admirable that all the
righteous by a wise judgment of God proclaim him the father of their faith, and
that no one is worthy of God and of his affection if he bears the name of
Abraham's sons. What makes his greatest glory in the eyes of God is that he did
not hesitate to believe in things that seemed incredible, which deserves him
among other rewards to see the Savior, in the hope of God, as our Lord Himself
declared to the Jews: Abraham your father rejoiced in the hope of seeing my
day; he saw it and rejoiced in it (Jn. 8:56). It was right that he who became a
father by the merit of his faith should live the hope of his children in the
distant past, a hope which God in his providential goodness should transmit as
the Father, inheritance from a deeply religious father to his imitating sons of
his obedience. Let us now see what was the object of this faith, that God might
have judged it worthy of so great an honor, and of such a glorious reward. We
praised Abraham's faith, but we have not yet told the object of his faith: God
brought him out of his tent, and showing him the stars of heaven said to him:
"Can you count these stars So shall your offspring be. Abraham believed
God, and this was imputed to him as righteousness (Gen. 15:5; Rom. 4:3). He
would have no great merit in believing in God, had he not believed an
incredible and insane thing in the judgment of the world, because one could not
naturally hope for what God promised him. Therefore, Abraham was the only one
in the world having believed this promise, was separated from the world and
justified. The incredulity of human wisdom serves to raise the greatness of
this faith, and that heroic hope which believed against hope. The hopelessness
of the worldly is the merit of the hope of the Christians. The defiance of the
wicked here makes the reward of the faith of the good, for faith is stronger
and more complete when its object is naturally incredible. This almost desolate
man believed that his wife, of a very advanced age, would give him a posterity
so numerous that it could not be counted, because he considered the act itself
promised to him less than he who promised it, and that he knew he could not
lie. So his faith was imputed to him for righteousness. There would be
stupidity in believing an absurd thing, the impossibility of which is known, if
we had no guarantor for the authority of the person who proposes this thing to
our belief. Abraham, therefore, demonstrates with admirable faith and great
prudence, believing what is naturally incredible, and. by confiding himself
fully to him to whom one cannot refuse to believe without folly and without
danger. What proves that our faith is reasonable is that it recognizes only God
alone the power to do all that he promises. This is the strength and triumph of
faith. Certain sages of the world, considering only the natural impossibility
of these things, declare that it is a madness to believe them. They forget this
maxim of the Apostle: and what appears in God as folly is wiser than men (1
Cor. 1:25). They would have the right to treat us as fools, if we knew here
what nature evidently does not have in nature. Now, what is impossible to
nature, we believe that God can do it if he promises it. What can be found
unreasonable in this conduct? If the fact to the fulfillment of which we
believe is indignant with God, it would be right to accuse our faith of
stupidity, but if it is worthy of God, by the very fact that it is impossible
for the creature, how can it not fill with praise the faith which gives as much
to the Creator as it refuses to the feebleness of the creature! Abraham is
therefore truly great and worthy of admiration for not having hesitated to
believe in God's promise against the judgment of the world, because God can do
what He promises. Although he was a native of Chaldea, he showed himself to be
the teacher of the faith, and though he was competent in astrology, he
preferred God's thoughts to the thoughts of man, considering that he was worthy
to believe that God could do a thing whose fulfillment would escape the investigations
of the human mind. He gave to his weakness the power of God, who, in order to
bring forth the unique and incomparable grandeur of his majesty, had resolved
to do things unbearable and impossible to the world. He thus wished to show
that he was the master of creation, and that every creature must submit to his
empire. The promise he made seemed impossible to all other men, but their
unbelief is all the more the lively faith of Abraham. His faith is the
chastisement of unbelievers, just as the iniquity of unbelievers makes his
glory. He is at the same time the Father of the faithful and the judge of the
infidels. By his example, the good will receive as reward eternal life, Abraham
is not troubled by this strange order, and he does not argue about whether he
should obey God, who commands him to kill his son, while he defends homicide
under the most severe penalties. The will of God inspires him with firmness,
and he does not hesitate to believe in the providential wisdom of what God
commands him. And yet it was this child who was the child of their old age and
a divine promise, the reward of their faith, the testimony of their virtue, and
on which rested all the hope of the posterity which God had given them
promised. In order to accomplish this commandment more religiously, he did not
inform the mother of the child, lest she should put obstacles to this
sacrifice. He knew all the tenderness of the love of mothers for their
children, and that is why he hides from him the sacrifice which is asked of him,
because he does not want to put any delay in doing what God commands him, to
teach us by his example that care and eagerness we must fulfill the
commandments of God. For if Abraham, this faithful servant, has obeyed such a
harsh and severe command, what obedience to much easier commandments ought not
be? O faith full of devotion to God! O unwavering hope in the Lord, which is so
dear and sweet, that it prevails over the tenderness of the fathers for their
children according to these words of Scripture: "Glorify and see that the
Lord is full of sweetness (Ps. 33:8)!” The holy patriarch was a prophet, and
knew what the future had in store for him. He therefore did not hesitate to
practice what our Lord recommends us in his Gospel, and to prefer the love of God
to the affection he had for this beloved son, obeying the words of the Savior :
"Whoever loves his father, or his mother, or his children more than me, is
not worthy of me (Matt. 10:33).” It is thus that this patriarch, to be
preferred of God above all others, did not hesitate to sacrifice his son to
him.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

44. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">HOW
CAN ONE PROVE BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHETS RECEIVED BY THE GENTILES UNDER
THE NEW COVENANT THAT THE PROMISE THAT GOD MADE TO ABRAHAM WAS FULFILLED BY THE
COMING OF CHRIST? </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— It is written in the
prophet Isaiah: "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all
nations. (Isaiah 56:7).” But the Jews may say, "The house of God, that is,
the synagogue, is open to all men." We do not say the contrary, but on the
condition that men will be circumcised before submitting to the law; for an
article of this law commands them to be circumcised following the example of
Abraham. There is, therefore, nothing new in this oracle of the Prophet, since
from the beginning of Judaism no one has been forbidden from any nation
whatever to embrace the practice of the law. The Prophet did not say anything
again, let us say more, his words are superfluous, if the Gentiles have always
been admitted to serve the God of Abraham, without ever having been defended.
And the truth is that none of those who wished to submit to the law were
rejected. Now, if it is so, it is very useless for the Prophet to remind us of
a truth which has always been known and observed. But who would be meaningless
enough to dare to say that such a great Prophet spoke unnecessarily and without
reason? I do not know if one can hear this language with impunity without
opposing it. Like the Jews to whom the prophets often reproached their crimes
against God, and the confidence they placed in idols, refused to enter into the
ways of penance and a sincere return to God, God, to confound them, declares
that he will open his house to all nations to pray, and that instead of the
Jews whom he rejects, he will admit other worshipers. If indeed the Gentiles
have always been admitted to the practice of the law, as we have said above,
how could the Prophet predicate this as a novelty, if not because he wanted to
signify something other than this which was previously ordered? For he could
not say of a thing that was done every day that it would be done in the future.
It is therefore evident that these words are the condemnation of the Jews to
whom the Prophet predicted that after their reprobation others will be called to
receive the gift of the grace of God that had been promised to the Jews. Now
the prophet Isaiah tells us what this promise is, when he says, "There
will come a Redeemer who will deliver Zion and remove Jacob's impiety, and that
is the covenant I will make with them (Is. 59:20).” This covenant is therefore
the destruction of sins; it is the new covenant which God promised in these
terms by the prophet Jeremiah: "Behold, the days come, Lord, and I will
establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not
according to the covenant I made with their fathers, in the days when I took
them by the hand to draw them out of the land of Egypt, which they have made
vain, and I have punished them, says the Lord (Jer. 31:31).” He wants to speak of
the evasiveness they made when they made a golden calf to worship him, and then
they profane his covenant. So the tables on which the law was written were
broken at the foot of the mountain, because the people deserved to receive more
severe and painful commandments. But the Lord, full of compassion and mercy,
promised by his prophets to change the law, and to replace it by an alliance
entirely different from the first, that is to say, not only all that the former
had of pain would be suppressed, but also all the precepts that were
figurative, like the Sabbath and circumcision. They had groaned for a long time
under this heavy burden, and God wished to deliver them from them wholly, that
they might render him humble thanksgiving. But they preferred to persevere in
the iniquity of their fathers, and did not wish to renounce the worship of
idols; the Prophet therefore predicted that the Gentiles with the few Jews who
had preserved the faith of the true God would enter into the new covenant to
punish the perfidy of the Jews for a double punishment. For in this world they
are burdened with the burden of precepts, and in the other life they will
receive the just punishment for their crimes, because they have been unfaithful
to God in the new as in the old covenant. God therefore declares that he gives
this new covenant to replace the old one that was given to their fathers. He
who serves God under this new covenant is no longer constrained to observe
either the Sabbath, new moons, circumcision, or the distinction of food; it is
enough to have the fear of God joined to the faith, because it is not by law
but by faith that you are justified according to this testimony of the prophet
Habakkuk: "The righteous will live by faith (Hab. 2:4).” Hence he no
longer needs a great number of precepts to please God; some of them are
sufficient from these other words of the prophet Isaiah: "When the number
of the children of Israel is as many as the sands of the sea, the remnant only
will be converted, for God in his righteousness will fulfill and abridge his
word; yes, the Lord will give an abridged word on all the earth (Is.
10:22)." Thus God made known the abbreviated word of the law, that is to
say, the new covenant which he had promised to the small number of those who,
the midst of general unbelief had persevered in faith. He gives it the name of
covenant, because, like the old covenant, it was confirmed by the testimony of
blood; they both bear the same name, with the difference that the ancient
covenant contained a great number of precepts, while according to the promise
of God they are greatly reduced in the new. God had foretold to Abraham that he
would be the father of many nations. (Gen. 17:4-5) Therefore, his children were
to be justified as the children, and to become children of Abraham, according
to the promise of the Lord, without recourse to the observances which had been
established only after the faith of one, Abraham, and by the faith which had
justified Abraham. It is not, however, new and unprecedented that men have been
justified without the observance of the Sabbath, circumcision, and other
prescriptions of this kind. Enoch was a friend to God and merited to be
transported (Gen. 5:44), nor was Noah the only righteous man that God found in
the flood; Abraham himself did not owe circumcision to be justified. Abraham
believed God, it is written, and his faith was credited to him as righteousness
(Rom. 4:3). Circumcision was for him a sign of his faith in the promise that he
would have a son in his old age. Abraham's merit does not come from
conciseness, but from his faith. Consequently, faith alone is enough to justify
men and make them children of Abraham by faith, not by circumcision of which
they have no need; for the object of their faith is not the same which was
imposed on the faith of Abraham. The Jews were subject to the precept of
circumcision, because they were to bear the sign of Abraham’s faith, not of
their faith, as the distinctive sign of the children of Abraham according to
the flesh; if they have faith themselves, they become his children by
justification. What is the use of a man without strength to call himself the
son of a powerful man? Is it not rather an obstacle for him, for it is a shame
for the son of a man whose glory equals the merit of being the same without
honor. Circumcision. is so unmeritorious, that God threatens by the prophet
Jeremiah to exert his vengeance on all who carry the sign of external
circumcision but without being circumcised of heart (Jer. 4:4). But he is not
angry with those who obey the circumcision of the heart without the
circumcision of the flesh, because no one can please God without the
circumcision of the heart. All who have received the circumcision of the flesh
are the children of Abraham according to the flesh; those who practice the
circumcision of the heart represent the children of Abraham according to faith,
because they cut off from their hearts all the errors of the world and
acknowledge God alone for their Father. What, then, is the circumcision of the
flesh without faith to the Jew in order to attain the perfection of Abraham? Or
in what way can the uncircumcision of the flesh hinder him, since no one can
attain the justice of Abraham without being the imitator of his faith? It is
therefore in vain that they glorify the circumcision of the flesh, since it has
no merit in the eyes of God. And if, as we have proved, it is better to have
faith than to be circumcised, the Gentiles are better than the Jews, then they
have faith, while the Jews have only circumcision. Which ones, do I say, will
Abraham recognize for his children, those who are like him after the flesh or
who are the imitators of his faith? But it was faith that bore witness to
Abraham. Therefore he glories not in the flesh, but in faith, and he admits to
the number of his children only those whom he sees to be the imitators of his
glory. For how could he call his children those who have only remoteness for
what made him pleasing to God and deserved the justification? He will rather
see in them his enemies than his children; and indeed they seem to be declaring
themselves to him by despising the faith which was the cause of his glory.
There is nothing surprising in the incredulity of the Jews who refuse to
receive the New Testament, since they have not been more faithful under the old
covenant. Their revolts against God were continual, they never ceased to
outrage him; therefore he imposed upon them severe precepts to keep under the
yoke those haughty and inflexible requirements. They would never acknowledge
that God was the source of all good; and yet how many favors they had received
from Him, than from brilliant prodigies carried out in their favor! This is
what he reminds them of through the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel: "I have
lifted up my hand against them in solitude, to scatter them among the nations,
and to spread them on the earth, because they did not observe my commandments,
and rejected my precepts.” And a little farther, "Therefore I have given
them precepts that are not good, and ordinances where they will not find life
(Ez. 20:33).” He teaches them why he has given them so many and difficult
precepts; they had only shown ingratitude for such great benefits; he imposed
upon them, under the inspiration of his justice, more severe commandments. He
calls them precepts which are not good, though they are righteous, because far
from justifying them, they turned to ruin, and that a punishment just that it
is, is not good for him who suffer. In spite of their infidelities, God, in his
goodness, promised to give a new covenant, where the law reduced to a few
precepts would justify as Abraham those who believed in him, that without the
observance of Sabbath, circumcision, and other precepts of this kind, and
merely remaining faithful to the precepts of natural law, which defend
homicide, adultery, and other similar crimes, they would be justified as had
been Abraham. Since he was reviving Abraham's faith on earth, he wanted to put
an end to all other prescriptions, and bring men back to the time of Abraham's
faith. But the Jews may say: Let us admit that the commandments given by Moses
have ceased to oblige by this abridgment of the law; Is circumcision one of
those precepts which ought to be repealed? It is through it that we bear the
sign of our father, the character of the children of Abraham, which must never
be repealed to be a perpetual testimony of our race. I answer that circumcision
must have been observed in its time, that is to say, before God had given men
the New Testament which he had promised. But as soon as the grace of God has
discharged men from the burdens of the law, what is still need of circumcision?
Now the new law, that is, the spiritual law, was given to put an end to carnal
observances, and so that those who embraced it would bear the sign of this law.
Thus, as in the Old Testament, the Jews bore the sign of Abraham to which the
old covenant belonged, so the Christians under the new covenant must bear the
sign of the Savior, the author of the New Testament. Indeed, just as the Hebrews
derive their name from Abraham, Christians take their name from Christ. All
those who still bear the name of Hebrews have not yet received the new covenant
which God has promised; they render useless the blessings and mercy of God, who
no longer wish that his people should bear the name of a man, but deign to give
to men the very name of his Son. What then is this audacity in the Jews to say
that it is their law, and not our own, that we practice, whereas David says
loudly, "I will praise you among the nations" (Ps. 17:50; 55:10), and
again: "Sit down at the same table with his people?" The Lord said to
the prophet Jeremiah, "I knew you before I had formed you in the womb of
your mother, and I sanctified you before that you did bring forth from his womb,
and I made thee a prophet among the nations. "(Jer. 1:5) Judaism has in
its Scriptures distinct names, and is represented under the names of Jacob, or
of Samaria, or of Jerusalem, or of Judea, or of Israel, but it is evident to
the Gentiles that they are designated by other names than the Jews, and
Jeremiah is more particularly our prophet, although God used all the prophets
to announce that the Gentiles would share in his promise. These, he says in a
more special way of Jeremiah because he is our prophet. It was he who was
charged to predict that the new covenant would be more fruitful for the
Gentiles than for the Jews, which we now see fulfilled. See, the new covenant
has been preached by all the earth, and yet it is so rare, so difficult to find
a Jew who has embraced the faith, that all the churches of the New Testament
bear the name of the pagan nations as the prophet Hosea had predicted: "I
will call my people who are not my people and my beloved whom I had not loved
(Hos. 2:24, Rom. 9:25)." God therefore rejects the Jews and calls the
Gentiles by an effect of that mercy and grace by which he has deigned to call
Abraham, for Abraham did not know the Lord before he was called. So he who
deigned to call Abraham also deigned to call the Gentiles. Why, then, is this
pretension to say: This is our law, when it is manifest that the gift of God
belongs to all those who sincerely want it? Let them therefore cease this rash
usurpation; the grace of God is the common heritage of all men. What boldness
yet to deny that our Lord Jesus Christ was promised in the law, when they see
Him gather in Him all the characters predicted by the law? All the nations that
believe in him are justified, according to the promise made to Abraham (Gen.
22:18); he was born of a virgin in Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah, according
to the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah, a race of David, as God had promised.
(Jer. 31:31), He preached the new covenant which God had promised to establish
with mankind, and after all the prophecies, miracles which he has effected, he
has humbled himself, as predicted by all prophetic oracles; he suffered, he
died, as it is written in the prophets. If they ask for the time when this
promise is fulfilled, as it is fixed in the prophet Daniel (Dan. 9:24), they will
find fulfillment of it at the time when Jesus Christ was born and suffered; for
from the first year of Darius, king of the Persians, to the birth and passion
of our Lord, and even to the ruin of Jerusalem, which took place under
Vespasian, the Roman emperor, the seventy weeks that is to say, four hundred
and ninety years, and this calculation is clearly established by the reigns of
the different princes who succeeded one another. Tertullian himself makes this
calculation in the book he wrote against the Jews (Ch. 8); but lest the
exactness and precision of his calculation should draw him insults, we have
passed over in silence. What difficulties can there be in this number, since
the number of these years has been fulfilled? It is therefore an impudence
without example, after the long space of time which has been added to the
advent of the Savior, to say: He has not come. That in the time of the
apostles, or when Our Lord still lived among men, malice could disguise itself
to contradict the truth, and that, notwithstanding the evidence of the
prophetic signs of Christ which shone in the Savior, the time of his coming to
better hide his perfidy, at the right time. But now that many years have been
added to the number predicted by the prophets, how impudent once again to deny
the coming of Christ whose signs and times concur in demonstrating the coming?
That a vase be full, but without overflowing, a spirit friendly to the dispute
may deny that it is full; but if it overflows, it puts an end to any discussion.
Thus the Jews were able to say in the time of the Savior (although without good
faith) that the calculations from Darius to Our Lord, which tended to prove
that He was the promised Christ, were ill-established. For we may be mistaken
in calculating the years, months, and days of the emperors, and we cannot have
precise and incontestable dates here. But now that years and centuries are
added to the precise number of years marked by the Prophet, what excuse remains
for the Jews not to recognize Christ in him who has come, unless he accuses of
falsehood (what God forbid!) the very author of the promise? For the time of
promise is past, and the promise of the promise is denied; what else is there
to say to the author of the promise, "You are a liar?" But not the
one who has promised is the truth itself, we have as proof all the signs which
the prophets have given of Christ and which we find united in the person of
Christ. As for the Jews, who would be ashamed of escaping from their error,
they do not think of the judgment which awaits them, for nothing is more guilty
than to deny the truth of what one perfectly understands is not a lie.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Here is what we read of Melchizedek in the book of Genesis and also in the
Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews: Melchizedek, priest of the Most High God,
appeared at the meeting with Abraham when he returned from the defeat of the
kings, offered him bread and wine and blessed him, saying, "Blessed be
Abraham of the Most High God who created heaven and earth and put your enemies
into your hands (Gen. 13:18).” And to make us better understand the one who was
represented by Melchizedek, the Apostle adds: "No doubt the one who
receives the blessing is inferior to him who gives it (Heb. 7:3)”; words which
the Apostle does not apply to the tradition of ecclesiastical ministry. Who,
indeed, would dare to say that the rule instituted by the Lord to bless the
faithful is superior to those which it blesses? It is therefore the mysterious
presence of the Lord that is felt in these words of which he is the object and
which recall him to our memory. The sacred author has wished to show us here
his personal dignity and his power. What then is the greatness of this man in
comparison with whom Abraham has only the second rank, in spite of the
superiority which his generosity and faith give him among the faithful? Let us
understand here that this Melchizedek does not bless Abraham, like the priests,
by pronouncing a solemn formula of blessing, but by a blessing peculiar to him,
and which he received not by an oral tradition but by nature and substantially.
The priests to whom we give the name of pontiffs have solemn formulas of
blessing which have been transmitted to them, and which they recite on the men
whom they bless, not always on those whom they desire, but upon those which
they do not wish to bless, because the author of this rule knows in what soul
he ought to shed his holy blessing. He, on the contrary, who possesses this blessing
substantially in virtue of his nature, and whom Moses calls the priest of the
Most High God, gives this blessing as he does. The words of blessing and his
nature always agree with his will. He never errs in wanting to give it where it
should not be, or refusing it when he should give it, the words of the blessing
he utters always have their efficiency. Our priests, on the contrary, invoke
the name of the Lord every day, and pronounce formulas of blessing, but very
few of them receive the effect. The priests also bless those who are superior
to them. Whatever saint we may be, we bow to receive the blessing, because it
is not an invention of the priest, but a divine institution.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"> </span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The high priest
Heli blessed Anna, and this blessing has not the merit of the grandmaster, but
the faith of this pious woman, whose pure heart God knew. (1 Kgs. 1:17) If
Melchizedek is declared superior to Abraham, it is not only because of priestly
dignity, but by his nature, and the sacred writer wants to teach us that he is
more that a man. It is impossible, indeed, to see only one man in one who is
placed above such a great friend of God, of a man so full of faith that for
love and fear of God he hesitated not to sacrifice his son, who was so dear to
him. By what justice, by what works could he have acquired more merit than
Abraham? What more could he do that Abraham did? In the first place, when he
did not know God, and without yet seeing any decisive sign, God said to him,
"Come out of your land and your kinsfolk and your father's house (Gen.
12:1)”, And he immediately obeyed without delay, thus accomplishing the will,
not only of God who spoke to him at that time, but of the Lord was to manifest
himself to mankind. Does not the Savior say, "Whoever loves his house, his
father, or his mother, or his brothers, or his parents, more than me, is not
worthy of me (Matt. 10:37)?" What then is the virtue and perfection of
Abraham who fulfills the commandments of the Savior before they are proclaimed
to the world? The Apostle recommends above all the practice of hospitality,
Abraham so faithfully exercised it that it is his example which seems to have
determined St. Paul to make this recommendation. He then thought that his
posterity would multiply like the stars of heaven, which seems a madness to the
eyes of the sages of the century (Heb. 13:2; Gen. 18:3), who are thus condemned
by his example even before God had threatened to lose their wisdom, for it is
afterwards that he says by his prophets: "I will lose the wisdom of the
wise (Isa. 29:14).” Abraham still obeys the command of God, who commands him to
circumcise himself, which he could not do without pain, and he submits to it to
give his descendants the example of patience (Gen. 17:24). God promises him
that he will have a son of Sarah his wife despite his advanced age, and he does
not doubt for a moment. He thus taught to future centuries that faith in the
authority of God must be so complete, that it does not allow the slightest
doubt about the commandments or the promises he can make even though they
appear contrary to reason. We must consider here the person rather than the
words, for it is the person who confirms and makes possible what the words
appear to be weak. It is God who promises, and we must believe that he can do
what seems impossible to men. In what way would man be reprehensible by
attributing to God a power which he does not recognize in himself? Thus Abraham
on the command of God does not hesitate for a single moment to put to death the
son that God has given him (Gen. 22:3), he is not surprised at the will of God
who demands death of a child whom he had given him as a testimony of his
goodness and power; he is too convinced that it is not for man to discuss the
will of God, and that his orders and his actions are inspired by a sovereign
reason. Now, in order to execute this order with the most eagerness, he leaves
his wife unaware; he knew the weakness of mothers for their sons, and that the
tears of tenderness might have hindered the act of religion which he could have
accomplished; he teaches his son only at the hour of sacrifice, that his
obedience may be full and entire at the command of God, in the execution of
which he does not see a parricide, but a holocaust demanded by the just judge.
What more heroic actions could have made Melchizedek to surpass Abraham, whose
obedience we have seen. was never surprised at fault? Moses, who conversed with
God face to face, was sent to his people and his brothers and refused to go.
The Prophet Jonah disobeys the order given him to go and preach to the
Ninevites, and to another country where he was not from (Jon. 1:11). Job, this
admirable man in all things, was, however, shaken by the death of his children;
he tore his clothes, and cut his hair (Job 1:20), but we do not read that
Abraham was grieved at the death of a son that was so dear to him, and we do
not see that this son whom God commanded him to sacrifice trembled before this
order that was given. We conclude from this that Melchizedek was more than a
man, for he could not prevail over Abraham unless he was of a superior nature.
Impassive nature possesses bliss by virtue of its substance, human nature
obtains it by its actions. It does not have the perfection of divinity, it is
therefore by exercise and by struggle that it becomes better from day to day,
when its victories are more numerous than its defeats. If it were always
impeccable in its actions, which is impossible, it would be better than God
(far from us this thought), because if a nature that can commit like avoiding
sin was always victorious from sin, it should be put above nature, which does
not sin because it is impassive. There would not seem to be great merit in not
sinning, because it cannot be; heroism would seem to have the faculty of ease
and of not sinning. There is, therefore, this difference between the nature of
God and the nature of man, that the nature of God is always happy in the
security of his invincible eternity, while the nature of man only reaches
happiness by work. Now it is necessary that the impassive beatitude should be
diluted with that which is the fruit of the tribulations which thus bring joy.
Impassive bliss has in it an inexhaustible source of happiness; for nature, on
the contrary, it is only after great trials that it rejoices at having escaped
death. Sadness is for it the means of animating happiness, and it’s passability
is irreconcilable with uninterrupted happiness. He, on the contrary, who is
impassive by nature, is always happy, because he does not know sadness, and
cannot even suspect that he can attain it. As to the human nature, although it
succeeds in felicity through labor, it will not be exempt from trials, and
scars will not fail. And how, in the midst of so many battles in which nature
is sometimes defeated, could it not receive wounds? Impassible nature, on the
contrary, remains inaccessible to any attack, any wound, to any defeat.
Scripture, therefore, would not say of Abraham that he is inferior to
Melchizedek, if Melchizedek was not of a superior nature to that of Abraham?
What we have just said may seem more ingenious than dense. But if we examine
the divine Scriptures, we will be able to raise still more and more of the more
excellent titles of glory. "This Melchizedek," says St. Paul, “king
of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who, when Abraham returned from the
defeat of kings, appeared to meet him and blessed him, and who first signified
the king of justice, was king of Salem, that is to say, king of peace; without
father, mother, genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, is
thus the image of the Son of God, and remains a priest forever.” And to bring
out these prerogatives in his place, he adds: "Consider therefore how
great was he to whom Abraham gave the tithe of his richest spoils (Gen. 14:18;
Heb. 7:1).”<span>   </span></font><font size="3">To show the full extent of
the merit and power of Melchizedek, he praises Abraham by saying that he is the
chief and prince of the patriarchs, that is, he is superior to all the others,
but inferior to Melchizedek, is it not evident that Melchizedek is not a man,
but that he is of a superior nature? But what do these two titles mean, king of
peace and king of righteousness? Look closer and see: the sun seen from far
away seems like a flaming beam, and at a distance you take money from a man and
be called king of peace, and justice, peace is preached to men, as well as
justice, but he is called king of peace and justice, to make you understand
that it is from him that justice and peace derive their origin, for it is
impossible to put above it what is subject to its direction, it is to the
institute of justice and peace that men do what is pleasing to God. Now these
two virtues, which are the mistresses of man, have Melchizedek as king. What
then is the superiority of Melchizedek over man, since the virtues which govern
mankind are subject to him, is it not being the king of kings? When St. Paul
tells us that he is a king of justice and peace, he wants to teach us that he
is the principle of both, and that just as our Lord Jesus Christ is the king,
the author of life, Melchizedek is the author of justice and peace, because
those who receive life through Jesus Christ are ruled by righteousness and
peace. For in the hearts of the servants of God he sends righteousness and
peace to serve as an ornament to the doctrine of the Lord. We read in Psalm:
"Let righteousness and peace be embraced, and let the truth rise from the
earth (Ps. 85:11)." And to be well aware of what justice he meant to
speak, the Psalmist adds: "Righteousness has looked from heaven.”
Scripture predicts what was to happen in the days of the Savior, when the
righteousness of God was given to the world through Jesus Christ, in the
knowledge of the mystery of one God whom he had promised previously by the
prophets. It was true, indeed, that the creature knew the truth of its Creator,
and this righteousness having been manifested to the earth, put an end to the
divisions which the injustice of ignorance of God had engendered, and reign
peace and harmony among the most divided minds, establishing them in the unity
of the same faith. It was thus that one saw kissing justice, the peace and the
truth exited from the same source. It was from the earth that the righteousness
which was to teach men was raised, for the incarnation of Jesus Christ taught
them the truth which they ought to know concerning the nature of God. Such is
the righteousness of God. Peace also comes from him, to the apostle's
testimony: "May the God of peace crush Satan under your feet.” I do not
see how these two things can be distinguished here, since the God of peace is
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ himself, for he says:
"I give you my peace (Jn. 14:27).” Why do you say that Melchizedek is the
king of justice and peace? I do not understand how that distinction can be
made. I therefore think that there is no difference here between the king of
peace and the God of peace. As no one on earth should be called God, be
reserved exclusively to the principle of all things, God establishes kings who
would be like his image, and who, with the exception of the name of God, would
have all his power; but as they are of earthly origin, they are the kings of
men, but not the kings of peace and justice: for they themselves have believed
above them righteousness that they are not permitted to despise. Justice for
them is God himself, justice is God's own good, and he who transgresses it
becomes guilty to the judgment of God. But for Melchizedek, Scripture does not
represent him as an ordinary king among men, because he has under his authority
justice which is above all kings. No one, in fact, can have justice under his
rule unless he is impeccable by nature. Now it is under its rule, because it is
he who has established it as a law destined to be a part of the world, to
direct those who are subject to sin. The king of justice is therefore the one
who rules the laws of which he is the author and who teach men what to believe
and practice to arrive at happiness. We have already stretched ourselves long
over the person of Melchizedek, and yet we say nothing worthy of him, unless we
return to the Scriptures, which has long pressed us, and which shouts to us to
draw us from the deep sleep which overwhelms us and call us to the intelligence
not of the night, but of the day. Scripture tells us that Melchizedek is
without father, mother, genealogy, and to prevent any interpretation would be
less worthy of this personage, it adds that he has neither beginning of days
nor end of life, Melchizedek, who was not subjected to birth or death, can
testify so clearly to all the subtleties of human reasoning, and what a mind so
clever and skillful that he would dare to resist and to pretend to impose its
interpretation on the sacred text, instead of accepting the meaning which it
naturally presents violence is inflicted on the divine Scriptures, and they
meet here as enemies the very people who seem to submit to it. There are some
who maintain that we ought not to believe in the person of Melchizedek what the
Scripture brings us, and who wish to turn the Scriptures to their thoughts. The
authority of the Scriptures to use ploys against them, by declaring war to them
under the appearance of peace, and by hiding hostile intentions under the guise
of friendship. They pretend, therefore, that it is not to show the greatness of
Melchizedek, but rather to show the obscurity of his condition that the
Scripture tells us that he was fatherless and without a mother. It wished to
show us that Melchizedek was of an unknown race, and was not of the tribe from
which Abraham came, since there was no trace of his family in the law. That is
why it says again, "and without genealogy," to make us understand
that there is no mention of his origin in the law, that he is not born of any
parents, and that it is to him that he owes the great qualities that
distinguish him. Now Scripture has so great authority here that it exposes in a
perfect order all the elements necessary for the cause. At first it said that
Melchizedek was "without father, without mother." Let us see what was
the mother of Nachor, the grandmother of Abraham, and the mother of Thare; nor
do we see what Abraham's mother was, not to mention the others. Shall we say
that they did not have mothers? If the Scripture had said only "without a
father," there would be a specious reason, for it has us preserved the
names of the fathers of all of whom it speaks. Scripture adds: "And
without genealogy.” If it expresses itself in this way to show that his birth
is not mentioned in the law, it was enough to say: "Without a
father," because no one knows his father. But it puts us still more
clearly on the path of truth by adding: "Having neither beginning of days
nor end of life.” Tell me, whoever you may be, who wish to do violence to the
text, how do you explain these words? What does it mean to have neither the
beginning of days nor the end of life? It is certainly sufficient to say that
the genealogy of Melchizedek was not inscribed in the law, and that, by the
same token, it must have been believed that he was of foreign origin. But one
can say that he was taken away from this world like Enoch, and that is why he
does not have end of life. Who then does not see a beginning of days? Will you
say: It is because there is no mention of the day of his birth. But is the birth
of others mentioned? and for you, however, the one whose day of birth is not
mentioned, must be regarded as having no beginning of days? But then the same
conclusion can be applied to others. Supposing now that he was taken from this
world, he was not for that reason without life, for everything that lives in
the expectation of death has a purpose. Stop these vain contestations, which
seem to please you. It is better to be vanquished by truth than to triumph over
truth by falsehood. It is a loss rather than a victory, for though the truth
seems to have loss in the eyes of man, it remains victorious in the eyes of God
because its reason is invincible. Our mind must therefore be conquered by the
law, in order to receive the meaning which it offers it, and not impose upon it
an interpretation at will, by violently substituting its authority for that of
the law. Listen to what Zorobabel says: "Truth triumphs over everything (3
Esdras 3:12).” Now Melchizedek reveals to us the future mystery of the
Incarnation and the Passion of the Savior, first restoring to Abraham, as to
the father of the faithful, the Eucharist of the body and of the soul, blood of
the Lord, to make the Father the truth that was to be fulfilled in the
children. If we want him to have been a priest like Aaron, or the present
priests, to be told, to be shown the place where he lived, the temple or the
synagogue in which he gathered the people, and offered sacrifices to him, or
the people who gathered round him. For if he exerts his priesthood on earth, no
doubt there existed, and before Abraham, a people whose priest he was, and this
people now worshiped the true God. How then did Abraham become the leader of
the believers, and it was through him that God was known to his people? In the
same way, if Melchizedek taught men on earth the fear of one God, why choose
Abraham to give his name to the people of God, since the servants of the true
God could be found among those who gathered around of Melchizedek? What more do
we read in the hymn which is found in Deuteronomy? When the Most High divided
the people, when he separated the children of Adam, he marked the limits of the
people, according to the number of angels of God. And he chose the people of
Jacob to be especially his (Deut. 32:8).</font><span><font size="3"> 
</font></span><font size="3">If there were no other people of God in the world other than the
children of Israel, why should there be found another people who followed the
doctrine of Melchizedek against the contrary testimony of the prophet? Since he
names all the peoples of the world, and gives only to the children of Abraham
the name of the people of God, the logical consequence is that he denies that
with the exception of the children of the God of Abraham, the others had the
knowledge of God, because God is known in the alleged. Melchizedek, priest of
the Most High God, appeared as a symbol of the holy mysteries which the future
was to reveal. The blessing was to be given later to the people of God by a
minister of God to whom we give the name of priest. Melchizedek therefore
appears as the precursor of the sacred person of the Son of God, and precedes
him to do him honor, though inferior to him in dignity. Let us then leave what
we have said of Melchizedek, Scripture says a thousand times more for the
confusion of the opponents. Indeed, after these admirable testimonies to
Melchizedek, Scripture confuses spiteful spirits by adding: "He is thus
the image of God and he remains forever." Consider then who is the object
of your unchallenged discussions and if he inspires no reserve, at least fear
Jesus Christ, to whom it is like, according to the authority of Scripture. The
Apostle comes insensibly and by order to the excellence of his nature, and if
the prerogatives which precede have impressed upon the spirits, that is, that
Melchizedek was king of justice and peace, has appeared in a visible body
without having either father or mother, that is to say without being born,
having neither beginning nor end, the last trait adds to all that he has just
said a new degree of credibility. Who would dare to say, unless renouncing
reason, that these glorious prerogatives are not suited to him whom the
Scriptures declares like the Son of God, and who remains a priest forever? But
he cannot be like the Son of God unless he has the same nature. And what is so
incredible that Melchizedek appeared in a humorous form, as soon as we
understand that he was the third person of the Trinity? For if the Christ who
is the second person has frequently appeared in the form of a man, what doubt
can we raise on what we have said? Do not we read in a psalm: "You are a
priest for eternity according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 109:4)?” These
words of the confession of all relate to the person of Jesus Christ, because
Christ is a priest for eternity according to the order of Melchizedek. But
Christ is the sovereign priest, and Melchizedek occupies the second rank. Now,
if Melchizedek is only a man, would it be proper that Jesus Christ should be a
priest for eternity according to his order? We see them both alike, both clothed
in one ministry, because they have one and the same nature. But since the
authority of one God must be preserved in every way, the third person appears
here subordinate to the name of the Father. As for Christ, he holds the place
of the Father, he is like his minister, and that is why he is given the name
(the priest). Similarly, the Holy Spirit, as minister, is also called the
priest of the Most High God, but not the sovereign priest, as our brethren
presume in the oblation: for although Christ and the Holy Spirit are
consubstantial, it is nevertheless necessary to preserve to each one the rank
given him The priests are given the name of envoys because they are the
representatives of the one who sends them, and they are like his image, and
this is the reason why Christ and the Spirit which is the natural image of the
Father, are called his priests: God manifests Himself in their person, as our
Lord has said: "He that sees me sees my Father (Jn. 14:9).” Now, if the
Lord has revealed Himself in the divine actions which He has effected, and if
these actions are the works of the Holy Spirit as he declares: "It is in
the Spirit of God that I cast out demons”, God manifested Himself in the Holy
Spirit.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">To consider only the
words, they seem to contain a contradiction, but this contradiction disappears
if we attach ourselves to the very meaning they present. The law speaks in
intelligible language to the attentive and serious minds, and the truth which
is hidden to the careless minds reveals itself to souls full of religious
solicitude. God indeed said, "In the fourth generation (Gen. 15:16),"
and Moses wrote, "In the fifth generation (Exod. 13:18),” it is Moses who
relates these two versions, and one cannot admit the intention of wishing to
deceive a man by whom the divine power has performed such great prodigies. We
must, therefore, examine the signification of these words, for Holy Scripture
never speaks uselessly and without reason. God and Moses each took a different starting
point here. God counts the four generations who were born in Egypt; Moses adds
to these four generations the one from which they came out when the Israelites
entered Egypt. "The children of Israel," he said, "came out of
Egypt to the fifth generation." He embraced all the generation that came
into Egypt and the four that were born in Egypt. From Abraham, the exit of the
children of Israel from Egypt is eight generations. For after the promise made
to Abraham, they dwelt in the land of Canaan two hundred and fifteen years, and
two hundred and fifteen years in Egypt. It is these years together that the
Apostle understands when he says in his Epistle to the Galatians: "The law
was given after four hundred and thirty years. Four generations were born in the
land of Canaan, the first in Jacob, the second in Jacob, the third in Levi, the
fourth in Gerson, Caath, and Merari. And Aram brought up Eleazar, and his
brethren, which formed the third generation: and Eleazar begotten Phinehas, and
it came to pass, that he was the firstborn of Egypt was the fourth generation,
and these were the four generations that were born in Egypt: therefore the Lord
said unto Abraham, <i>Your seed shall dwell

</font><i><font size="3">and they shall come forth out of this
land of exile after the fourth generation</font></i><font size="3"> (Gen. 15:13) Is it not evident
that God only wanted to speak exclusively of what was accomplished in Egypt?
Moses, on the contrary, wanted to add this generation which came to Egypt with
Jacob his father, and from which came forth the four following. Hence these
words: </font><i><font size="3">The children of Israel came forth
out of the land of Egypt into the fifth generation</font></i><font size="3">. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

AS A SIGN OF HIS FAITH?</span></span><span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">
</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— If you want to pay attention to
it, you will see a perfect fit in what at first sight might seem to you devoid
of reason. Abraham believing that he would have a son in which all nations
would be blessed, and who would be the principle of all holiness, received the
sign of this promise on the member by whom the generation of children begins,
it tends to a higher holiness. If we were tempted to see in it something
different, let us remember that circumcision was a subject of joy for Abraham,
and that his children were always glorious in this testimony. Indeed, Achior,
one of the princes of the idolatrous nations, witnesses of the great wonders of
the God of Abraham, who by the hand of a simple woman had cut off the head of that
general of the olives Assyrian militia, whose whole land dreaded power, wished
to receive circumcision himself as a mark of honor and dignity (Judith 13:27;
14:16). Is not a Christian proud to have lost an eye or a member for the name
of Jesus Christ? does he not discover this part mutilated in the eyes of men as
a title of glory? And in this way, a momentary loss for faith is a real gain.
The circumcision which Abraham received as a sign of his faith, was therefore
for him not a mutilation of the soul, but a mark of honor. Now this ceremony
signified in the spiritual sense that the clouds of the flesh were to be cut
off from the hearts of men by the faith of Jesus Christ, because the error of
the senses, covering the hearts of men as a cloud, an obstacle to the Creator's
knowledge. Now, Abraham, to whom God promised that the Christ who was to dispel
this cloud would be born one day of his race was circumcised, because he
believed that a son would be born to him that would destroy this error. Judge
now whether it was not proper that he should receive on this part of the body
the sign of his faith.</span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"> </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Lord, because the Lord resurrected that day after the Sabbath; the figurative
sign of salvation was given in circumcision to make known the future
regeneration even under the law of circumcision. It was by faith that men were
to be saved, and this faith received its confirmation on the first day of the
resurrection of the Savior; the figurative sign of salvation was thus
established on the first day in the law of circumcision, which was also to be
the sign of the faith of Abraham. Harmony is therefore complete here; the sign

WERE THE CHILDREN CONSPIRED WITH THEIR PARENTS IN THE FIRE OF SODOM?</span></span><span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">— </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In order to bring out the greatness
of the crime of the inhabitants of Sodom, God wanted the punishment to be
extended until the death of their children, in order to destroy even the last
remains of this guilty race. But did not God act in their interest lest, by
prolonging their lives, they should follow the example of their fathers?
because they are exempt from the punishments of hell, because they have been
victims of a crime they did not commit. The parents are responsible for the
double responsibility of their punishment and that of their children, because
to erase the traces of their crimes, it was necessary to destroy all their
posterity. Just as children rejoice in the virtues of their parents, because
they are for them a title of glory, so they have no right to complain about the
death that strikes them to punish the crimes of those who have given the day.
They are associated with benefits, they must be punished. In Egypt, children
were also punished for the faults of their parents, but to bring back these
regulators to more just feelings. The other wonders could not have led them to
believe in the God represented by Moses and to adore him; this scourge had for
the last time, by striking them with terror, to make them confess and expiate
their hardening, and to spare them a more rigorous chastisement. The crime of
parents is the cause of the death of children. However the children have paid
this debt, they will one day be the accusers of their parents, because the very
blood of their children has not been able to triumph over their treachery. It
is therefore not for the future life, but for the present life that the
children have suffered the punishment due to the crimes of their fathers. And
it is not for them a slight favor to escape guilt without, however, being in
glory. We see men asking earnestly at the end of their lives to profess the true
faith, in order to obtain, if not the crown, at least their pardon; How, then,
can those who by their conduct in their regard have neither to implore the
forgiveness of their faults, nor to obtain an extraordinary reward, because
they have not deserved it by their labors? Compare a moment of suffering with a
torment that lasts for centuries. Consider, moreover, that a great number give
themselves much trouble, and for lack of perseverance, not only lose the fruit
of their labors, but are guilty of punishment. Add to this that it is difficult
for those born of vicious parents, who have been brought up or who have lived
in the society of the wicked, to bend their souls under the yoke of divine law.
See here again if God did not act wisely towards these children.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

why the Savior no longer wanted his servants to swear an oath, he only

The oath is demanded only by the disloyalty or faithlessness of a deceitful

considered in his conscience; but as to foresight, it remains alien to
unfortunate events. For God alone can judge things to come. That is why the
righteous one, to consider only the outside, believed that his eldest son
deserved to be blessed preferably. But God, who knows what is most secret, can
see that the younger deserves this blessing, to show that this blessing was not
a human favor but a grace from God; for it is not to the merit of man, but to
the dignity of employment, that the blessing of God is attached. We see in the
book of Numbers that God said to Moses and Aaron, who were priests, "Call
upon my name on the children of Israel, and I, the Lord, will bless them (Num.
6:27)." Thus grace is transmitted to men by the ministry of those whom God
chooses for this purpose, without the will of the priest being an obstacle or
an advantage; God only takes into account the character of the person who asks
for the blessing. Let us understand the greatness of the priestly dignity. The
Evangelist, speaking of Caiaphas, said that high priest, who carried the
wickedness to the last restrictions by having the death of the Savior. “He did
not say that of himself, but this prophecy, because he was high priest of this
year (Jn. 11:51).” We see that the Spirit of graces is not attached to the
person, whether worthy or not, but to the succession of the priestly order.
Therefore, whatever may be the merit of a man, he has no power to bless unless
he is chosen and ordained to fulfill this sacred function; but it is always
from God that the blessing receives its efficacy. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

GOD (GEN. 32:30), AND MOSES SAW GOD FACE TO FACE. (EXOD. 33:11) THE LORD ALSO
SAYS, "I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THE GOD OF ARMIES.” (ISAIAH 6:5) ON THE
CONTRARY, THE EVANGELIST ST. JOHN SAYS: "NO MAN HAS EVER SEEN GOD. (1 JN.
4:12) SO HERE THERE IS A CONTRADICTION.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — To speak according to the truth, no man has really
seen God, neither the Father, nor the Son. If the Scripture tells us that men
have seen Him, it is by intelligence, for it could only appear to them in figure.
Just as without knowing the emperors, we see them in image and not in reality,
so God was seen in the sense that men understood that God appeared to them in a
rational and not substantial way, for God cannot be seen in his nature. To put
the difficulty of this question into the light of day, let us try to explain
the meaning of John's words. For he wanted here to reveal to us a hidden truth
which is part of the doctrine of salvation: "No man," he says,
"has ever seen God; the only Son who is in the bosom of the Father has
manifested Himself.” (Jn. 1:18) Let us examine the meaning of these words of
the Evangelist; to show us that there is no truth that no man has ever seen
God, he places this statement on the lips of the Son himself, who cannot be
deceived because he is in the bosom of the Father. Now, what is the bosom of
the Father, except the feeling of love of the true Father for his Son by the
unity of nature which is common to them? No one has ever seen God except the
only begotten Son, which is what the Apostle of God revealed among other things
to St. John the Baptist: "It is not that anyone has seen the Father, there
is only one who is of God who has seen the Father.” Now it is to condemn the
Jews who would neither hear, nor believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God,
that the Evangelist proves to them that it is this same Christ who appeared as
God to the patriarchs, and that the Father has never been seen except by the
Son. Indeed, by denying that God the Father was ever seen, and declaring,
however, that God appeared to the patriarchs, the Son of God wants to reveal
himself and show that it is he who appeared as God to their fathers. This is
why he says to the Jews in speaking of his Father: "You have never heard
his voice nor seen his face.” (Jn. 5:37) So there is no contradiction in saying
that God all at once has been seen and is invisible.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

It is an incontestable truth that Joseph did not make this recommendation to
the children of Israel without cause. It cannot be supposed that the man whose
gaze had plunged into the future spoke here without reason. He was full of a
profound religion for the Creator God; he also knew what a veneration they had
for the Egyptians, who remembered the wisdom of his administration during the
famine which weighed upon Egypt. He therefore wished to take away this cause of
error from him after his death, and to prevent them from rendering him worship,
which belongs only to the Creator, for he knew all too well that the vain and
light people are inclined to render divine honors to the dead rather than the
living. He proves by this conduct that he did not share the vain superstitions
of the Egyptians, since he orders to carry his ashes so that they do not become
a subject to offend God. The Apostles imitated this example. Paul and Barnabas,
perceiving that they wished to offer them a sacrifice, and knowing how much God
abhorred such idolatry, tore their clothes, exclaiming, "What are you
doing? we are men like you (Acts 14:14).” And they turned away the people from

  of a bush to show that this bush was the figure of men's sins. Now, as it was
  to fight sin that he had come down to give the law, and the thorns are in
  Scripture the figure of sins, "I waited," said God by his prophet,
  "that produced grapes, and produced only thorns,” (Isa. 5:2), and that
  the law did not immediately punish sin, but make it known; the fire did not
  consume the bush, that is to say, the law that was given did not render the
  fishermen guilty and worthy of punishment for the past. Sins are not
  essentially about human nature, they are only accidental; in the same way the

  the heights where Jesus Christ is. He appeared in the middle of a bush,
  because the bush is armed with thorns that wound and is easy to ignite, and
  yet it was not consumed by fire. Fire is the emblem of the law, which is like
  a fire for sinners. The bush is the figure of sins, and the Savior represents
  it as being compared to other trees as the emblem of the evil tree. Sins are
  nothing more than acts of malice. So when fire appeared as the symbol of the
  law, he did not consume the bush, just as the law given because of past sins
  did not punish them; he has suspended the effects of his justice, and
  exercised it only against those who despise his authority. So the Lord

16. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">WHY DID THE ANGEL WHO WANTED TO
KILL MOSES, IN THE ROUTE, BE APPEASED BY THE CIRCUMCISION OF HIS CHILD? </span></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">—</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
At the sight of the angel who threatened him, Moses repaired an omission which
had been at home without purpose. The anger of the angel stopped before the
completion of this ceremony, deferred by negligence. Now, this anger of the angel
that threatens Moses to take his life, comes from the fact that the fault of a
man raised in dignity has a particular character of gravity. This gravity is
always in direct proportion to the elevated position one occupies. The fault
committed by a man whom God had chosen to be the sovereign chief of his people
was therefore very great. Moses was going to stand before the children of
Israel as the messenger of the God of Abraham, and he did not bear the sign of
the righteousness of Abraham, whom he knew to be a title of glory to the Jews,
and he exposed to pass for a seducer or not to be received as the envoy of God
who had chosen Abraham. He had not circumcised his children during his stay in
the land of Midian; He was not to take them with him to Egypt, from where he
was going to draw his brothers, or to circumcise them first for the reasons we
have given. Zipporah, wife of Moses, as the Scripture recounts summarily,
knowing for what reason the angel was angry with her husband, took a sharp
stone and circumcised his son, and the angel departed. She soothes by this
action the anger which the negligence of Moses had excited against him.
Scripture often speaks in a very concise form of things which the very subject
it treats must imply; for example, in these reproaches that the Savior
addresses to the Jews: Why did you even violate the command of God to remain
faithful to your tradition? for God has made this command: Honor your father
and your mother; and this other: Whoever has insulted his father or mother with
words will be punished with death. But you say, Whosoever shall say unto his
father or to his mother, Every gift that I offer of my good shall be your
reward, and after that he shall not honor his father and his mother."
(Matt. 15:3-6, Exod. 20:12) Here, of course, the Savior abridged his speech,
and implied that the Jewish priests, by engaging in greed, despised the law of
God. By a show which impiety alone could inspire, they gave to the children who
curse their father and mother the advice of offering to God what they would
like, and thus to be freed from the sentence pronounced against the children
who insult their children’s parents. But the children in this council had
nothing but contempt for their parents against the express command of God. So
Moses saw the angel angry with him, understood the reason, and told his wife
what was to be done to calm the anger of the angel who wanted to take his life.
This is what is implied in the story, as well as what we have pointed out in
the reproaches addressed to the Jewish priests.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

BEFORE PHARAOH THAN THAT OF THE ROD TURNED INTO A SERPENT? </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—<span> 
</span></font><font size="3">Whoever would be tempted to reproach Moses, tells us what other prodigy
he should have done. He changed his rod into a serpent to impress terror, but
without doing any harm, because the natural numbness of the snake makes his
fury slower. If Moses had made a lion, bear, or other animal appear, how could
those who were present have escaped? God did not want this serpent to cause the
death of anyone; his intention was only to inspire a salutary fear and to
manifest his power. It was by the snake that the sin of our first parents had
begun, it was also the sight of a snake that was to recall the remembrance of
the knowledge of God, and the necessity to change one's life so that sin was
destroyed by the same means that had helped to make him commit. So again, it is
through a woman that sin originated, it was by a woman that it was erased, by
Mary, mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ who destroyed the kingdom of sin: Eve was
still a virgin when she succumbed to sin, just as Mary was also a virgin when
she was chosen to be the Savior's mother. Thus all that had perished was
restored to its former state; it is by taking from the fruit of the tree that
the kingdom of heaven was lost, it is by a tree that we recover our rights to
this kingdom. "The Lord," said the Psalmist, "reigned by the
wood.” (Ps. 95) It was by the same design that the world had to be repaired at
the same time that it was created, that is to say, at the beginning of the
first month which is the epoch of the Passover. There is therefore no other bad
nature than the. transgression of the law since sin is erased by the same means
used to commit it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE REASON FOR THE PASSOVER. </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
The word Passover, my dear brothers, comes from the word passion, as we learn
from the figure of this mystery which was celebrated in Egypt by Moses, the
faithful servant of God, to the testimony of Scripture: “Here is the Passover
of the Lord's sacrifice.” (Exod. 12:11) But why was this mystery celebrated by
the blood, why was life repaired by death, so that when it was believed to make
a greater number of victims, did it suffer to restrain its power by the blood
of the Savior, and to receive the blow which undermined its empire from that
very death in which it believed it had displayed all its power? By a marvelous
disposition of Divine Providence, death finds death in its work. As it always wishes
evil, God seemed to yield to it for a time, so that, being destroyed in its
unjust endeavor, it could not complain of being deprived of its empire over
men. God can do everything, it is true, but he does nothing that is contrary to
reason. He himself follows the rules of justice that he requires of men,
without ever abusing his power. God has therefore shown admirable providence
towards the human race; the rights and decrees of divine justice have been
safeguarded and fulfilled, and man has been delivered from the death which held
him in his chains for good reason. But as he had been deceived by the envy of
the devil, it seemed just to God to come to his aid. He was condemned by God's
judgment, but Satan was the cause. In the same way that it seemed right to God
to deliver man, it would have been unjust to effect this deliverance by an act
of his power, without the harmony of justice. The man having been defeated by
the persuasions of Satan, the demon stood up like an accuser, to oppose the
mercy. God, therefore, ensures that he who glorifies himself in the sin of man,
should be convinced in the light of sin, that the conscience of his crime may
render him any contradiction impossible. The Son of God became man, and
preaching righteousness to men, inciting against him the hatred of the devil,
because he turned them away from vices of which the demon is the father, and
this hatred went so far as to put him to death he who did not know sin. It was
then that the devil himself was convicted of sin, and of a sin much greater
than that of the man he accused. By virtue of a decree of God, he claimed that
the man belonged to him because of his sin, because the one who sins ranks with
the party of the devil, but he was convinced of a much greater crime, when he dared
put to death the one who had not sinned to extend his empire over him. It was,
therefore, death which struck a mortal blow to death itself; the outpouring of
blood saved the blood; that is to say, as I have recalled, that the author of
death who is the devil, having been convicted of a crime in the death of the
Savior, lost all rights over his blood and blood to us all; for just as by the
sin of the one Adam alone did he hold all men under the bondage of death, he
saw himself carried off all men by the innocence of one. The blood of the
Savior poured out unjustly had the reward of victoriously saving the blood to
which it owed its origin, and of restoring it to its former state by elevating
it to a greater perfection. Conquered death dares not contradict its conqueror.
Blessed, then, is the mystery of the Passover, which redeems us by blood,
triumphing over death by death, just as it is customary to triumph by the
poison of the very action of poison.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WRITTEN ON THE TWO TABLES, OR WHAT WORDS WERE ENGRAVED ON EACH TABLE, AND WHAT
WAS THEIR NUMBER?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
— These ten words are the ten commandments. This is how the Savior calls the
feeling that he asks the Jews, among other things: "I have a word to ask
you too; answer me: Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or men? (Matt.
21:24) He gives this feeling the name of speech. It is for a similar reason
that Scripture tells us that ten words were written on the two tables, and
these ten words are ten different thoughts. Here is the first word: "You
shall have no other gods but me." (Exod. 3) Then comes the second:
"You will not make any image of what is above in heaven, nor of what is
down on the earth, or in the waters under the earth. " God adds in the
third place: "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,
for God will not regard as innocent one who has taken in vain the name of the
Lord his God," that is, you do not take the name of your God to support a
lie and perjury that imposes that name. The fourth commandment reads, "You
shall keep the Sabbath of the Lord your God, and you shall not do any servile
work in this day." These first four words relate directly to God and are
the subject of the first table. Others: The first word of the table:
"Honor your father and your mother," the second: "You shall not
kill;" the third: "You shall not be adulterous”; in the fourth,
"You will not stumble”; The fifth: "You shall not bear false witness;
The sixth: "You will not covet anything that belongs to your
neighbor." The Apostle St. Paul tells us that these were the commandments
of the second table when he said, "Honor your father and your mother,
which is the first commandment of the promise. "(Eph. 4:2) How would this
commandment be first if God had not engraved it at the head of the second
table? Saint Paul says “of the promise”, because God adds immediately: "In
order that you may be happy and live long on the earth." This is the
promise that is made to those who keep the commandments. So here you have the
separate commandments, their exact number and the precise indication of those
engraved on each table.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

PRAISES JUSTICE, THREATEN TO PUNISH THE SINS OF PARENTS THROUGH THEIR CHILDREN
UNTIL THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATIONS?</span></span><span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">— </span></font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">God
can neither do nor say any injustice, to doubt it is madness. If, therefore,
none of the words of the Lord are removed, but all the elements of the question
are carefully put together, the light will give way to the darkness, and one
will regard as a trait of goodness what appeared a sovereign injustice. To
remove some of the elements of a question is to show either ignorance or bad
faith, it is the work of a man who likes to slander rather than educate
himself. But God has threatened, it is true, to pursue the sins of the parents
even on their children, but on those who would have only hatred for him, that
is to say, who persevere in the iniquity of their children, fathers, would worship
idols after their example; for it is declaring itself the enemy of God to
attribute to the creature the honor which is due to him alone. Just as the
children of the righteous who are righteous themselves ennoble a family, where
righteousness is transmitted as an inheritance and receive the double glory of
their virtues and those of their parents, so also the children of the wicked
who inherit their wickedness add to the crimes of their fathers, because they
are the children of the wicked and they imitate their guilty examples for the
loss of many. God wants to inspire terror here, but his word is true and
justified in reason. Who of us, in fact, executes the bad son of a guilty
father in the most ludicrous manner? who does not judge worthy of a double reward
the virtuous son of a good man? Now, God threatens to exert his vengeance even
on the third and fourth generation, because a bad father may have a son who
does not walk in his footsteps, while the grandfather will follow him in the
path of evil; but he must know that he cannot escape the rigor of this
sentence. If, on the contrary, the grandfather does not follow the example of
his grandfather, but those of his father, like God's law, like him, let the
great grandfather not forget that the sentence may be to extend to him, if he
imitates the criminal conduct of his son.<span> 
</span></font><font size="3">In enacting this law, God wished to act upon the impiety of the parents,
and to make them recognize the innumerable evils which the idol-worship, so
that their affection for their children reminded them at least of the
sentiments of religion which they to their Creator, or so that the sons, in the
fear of punishment due to the crimes of their fathers, weave profession of
obedience to the law of God. But the foolish ones, by an excess of malice,
interpret in another sense this divine sentence, saying, "Our fathers have
eaten green grapes, and the teeth of the children have been troubled,"
(Ezek. 13:2) that is to say, assured of impunity, because their children would
suffer the penalty due to their sins, they remained insensitive to the
spiritual love of God as well as to the natural affection for their children.
That is why God says to them through his Prophet: "The son will not die
for the father, nor the father for the son, but the soul that has sinned, will
die itself. He wants to teach them that it is in vain that they hope for
impunity, but that the sins of fathers will be punished in the person of
children, in the sense that they will be more rigorously cheated, because by
imitating impiety of their fathers they renewed the example of crimes which
they should have erased. After having made known the evils of which idolatry is
the source, God immediately adds the picture of the rewards which he reserves
to those who love him: "And I have mercy in the following of a thousand
generations to those who love me and keep my commandments," (Exod. 20:6),
that is, the virtues of the father are rewarded not only in the rear of the
grandchildren, but even after a thousand and a thousand generations. Thus, for
example, that a man who loves God is of the race of David, whose existence goes
back well above a thousand years, he is the object of the mercy of God, and in
the necessity he deserves to double the title of receiving this mercy, by his
personal fidelity in the service of God, and because he descends from the race
of a man who has professed to love God. And it is here that the goodness of God
is truly worthy of our praise. His righteousness on those who lower him is only
exercised until the third and fourth generations, and not over thousands of
generations. If, therefore, iniquity is perpetuated in the fifth generation,
his vengeance begins from there to spread again to the third and fourth
generation. But this objection will be made to me: The first author of a crime
must be more severely punished than the one who merely imitates him. The
perpetrator of the crime receives the just punishment due to him; if the
children are more rigorously punished, it is the punishment of the parents. If
you ask why, I will answer that the knowledge of the law adds to the gravity of
sin, as it happened to Lamech and after Lamech himself. There are, however,
some who think that the sons bore the penalty due to the crimes of their
fathers when they were taken captive in expiation of their crimes, and that
they remained there until the fourth generation. If this feeling is true, not
only did God not only punish the sins of the fathers over the children who
hated him, but also those who loved his name, for among these captives were
Daniel, the three children Baruch, Ezekiel, and Ezra, who was born during
captivity itself. So we clearly answered the question we had asked ourselves.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this sentence against those who transgress the law of God, and to punish them
for having abandoned his worship, they were condemned not to marry, and not to
leave posterity, the Jews had fallen into the error of seeing as guilty in the
eyes of God those who would not take women, or who, while marrying, could not
have children, as if God did not ask something other than children; it is the
reproach that the prophet Malachi makes to them. Therefore, to console those
who were grieved by the false interpretation of his words, teaches them that he
who cannot or will not have children, has nothing to fear, provided he observes
the law of God. The curse fell only on those who had the power and the will to
have children, remained sterile by an effect of the judgment of God, who
refused the fruit of creation to those who had only contempt for the Creator.
He wanted that, seeing himself condemned to being unable to father children, or
to preserve their lives if they had them, to recognize the effects of the wrath
of an angry God and to return to him in the feelings of true repentance.
Indeed, the holy personages who were eager to have children without being able
to obtain them, believed that their sins were their cause and they were deeply
afflicted, not knowing that the providence of God reserved them for the
accomplishment of his designs. Thus, through divine intervention, Hannah
conceived and bore Samuel (1 Sam. 1:20), Elisabeth John the Baptist (Luke
1:24), and the wife of Manoah, Samson. (Judg. 13:24) The spiritual meaning of
these words is that one must look upon as cursed those who have not left
posterity destined to see God, that is to say, who have not inspired their
children, or their servants, or their neighbor, the feelings of fear of God
that they themselves would have to teach others on the earth. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

8.</font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> WHY DID MOSES, COMING DOWN FROM
THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE TABLES OF THE LAW, HAVE A FACE SO BRIGHT THAT IT COULD
NOT BE FIXED ON HIM? </font></span></span><a name="_Hlk519372555"></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> The power that God had given to
Moses over sinners was reflected by this mark of honor and by that dazzling
face as he descended from the mountain. For it is against the followers that
the law was given. So Moses, who had not sinned, appeared surrounded by glory
and glory so glorious that the followers could not stop their eyes on him. The
Lord wanted to show in his person that sinners are not worthy to see the glory
of God. In fact, after the Israelites had melted and worshiped the idol of the
golden calf, after Moses had broken the tables upon which the law of God was
written, Moses went up a second time on the mountain with new tables, and when
he came down with the law God had written there, his face cast such rays of
light that the children of Israel and Aaron himself could not stop looking at
him because they had sinned. So he spoke to them by putting a veil on his face,
for as long as they sinned in their sins, they were unaware of seeing the glory
of God. This is why the Apostle says, "When this people is converted to
the Lord, the veil shall be taken away," (1 Cor. 3:16), that is, when
purified by the grace of God, they will become worthy of to contemplate the
glory of God. In breaking the two tables which he had received in the first
place, Moses showed the reprobation of this people, who, by their attachment to
iniquity, was to render themselves unworthy of divine promises. The law given a
second time meant that this people would succeed another who could not take
advantage of the law given on the mountain.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS TO THEM THROUGH THE MOUTH OF THE PROPHET JEREMIAH:
"ADD AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS TO YOUR VICTIMS, AND EAT
THE FLESH OF YOUR SACRIFICES, FOR I DID NOT ORDAIN TO YOUR FATHERS, IN THE DAY
THAT I TOOK THEM OUT OF EGYPT, TO OFFER ME BURNT OFFERINGS AND VICTIMS.”</font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> — This question of holocausts and
sacrifices, thoroughly examined, cannot cause any difficulty, and the Lord
neither contradicted nor changed his prescriptions by revoking a commandment he
would have given. In fact, we find no command that relates to the sacrifices,
libations, and burnt offerings he speaks of in this place. Remember, then, that
there were two kinds of sacrifices; the first included all the sacrifices which
God had prescribed for the different circumstances; the other the voluntary
sacrifices. God had thus prescribed the various sacrifices that were to be
offered either for sins or for the firstborn, and regulated the matter and mode
of these sacrifices. But the voluntary sacrifice had not been the object of any
command; it was left to the will of everyone who offered what he considered
good; these sacrifices were essentially voluntary. But as negligence and
recklessness were introduced into these sacrifices and the Jews did not think
that the gifts offered to the Almighty should be carefully chosen, God said to
them, "I did not command you to offer me these sacrifices, but if you want
to offer them, you must choose victims worthy of me.” Thus Cain made himself
guilty by not thinking that he should offer God the best fruits of the earth.
(Gen. 4:6) They claimed to offer these sacrifices to God, to make him
favorable, and they rather attracted his indignation; and far from doing a good
work as they boasted, they were guilty of offering to God burnt offerings
unworthy of him. This is the reproach he makes them by the prophet Malachi:
"If you present a blind or crippling heifer for a sacrifice, is it not an
evil?" "Raise it to your master or chief if they please him, or if he
welcomes your face, says the Lord Almighty. "(Mal. 1:8) He addresses the
same complaints to them by the prophet Isaiah: I have not made for you to seek
or purchase incense at great cost, I did not desire the fat of your victims,
and you presented them before me covered with your sins and your
iniquities." (Isa. 1:11) This is the true motive of these reproaches: they
offered voluntary sacrifices to God, but these sacrifices were not homage
pleasing to God because they offered him unworthy victims without these
sacrifices being obligatory. God had demanded them; necessity could have
excused the more or less perfect choice of the victims; but as these sacrifices
were voluntary, they had to offer victims that were a testimony of their
religion towards God. Their mind was entirely devoted to the false worship of
idols; from this negligence in the sacrifices they were taking away from the
true God. The Lord therefore reproaches them with a double reproach, of daring
to sacrifice to God with a soul soiled by iniquity, and of offering him victims
unworthy of him; for the guilty actions are not redeemed by sacrifices, but by
the tears and mercy of God. So listen to what David says after his sin:
"If you had wanted sacrifices, I would have given you some, but burnt
offerings are not pleasing to you. The sacrifice that God requires is a soul
broken with pain, God does not disdain a contrite and humiliated heart.” What
does Samuel say to Saul, who, having despised the Lord's commandments, imagined
that he might appease him with a sacrilege? "Does the Lord want
sacrifices? Do not you rather ask to obey his voice?" (1 Sam. 15:22) God
also says in Scripture, "I prefer mercy rather than sacrifice.” (Hos. 6:6)
Now the Jews who were without righteousness and without mercy, believed that
they might give themselves to God by sacrifices; This is what Christians still
do today who, without taking any notice of justice, feel that their offerings
make them worthy of praise and reward. The sacrifice made to God is a good
thing, but on the condition that justice be observed and the mercy practiced;
for we must exercise in regard to others what we ask for ourselves.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

43. </font></span></b></a><font size="3"><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">SINCE GOD FORBADE ABRAHAM TO
SACRIFICE HIS SON, WHY DID HE NOT ALSO DEFEND JEPHTHAH FROM SACRIFICING HIS
DAUGHTER? </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">There is a big
difference between Abraham and Jephthah. At first Abraham had a legitimate
birth, while that of Jephthah was illegitimate, for he was the son of a
courtesan. Then, Abraham's life was irreproachable; Jephthah was chief of
lawbreakers. Abraham was a righteous man and that temptation had felt. Jephthah
could not present any testimony of justice. Abraham was therefore commanded to
sacrifice his son to God to show men the greatness of his faith in God, since
at his command he did not hesitate to sacrifice his son to him. Indeed, he does
not doubt for a moment that he who, against all human hope, could have given
birth to this child of a sterile and advanced woman could not, against the laws
of nature, resuscitate him from among the dead. This obedience was the height
of Abraham's righteousness, for God saw then that he did not ask for the blood
of this child, but that he only wanted by this commandment to put the last line
to the virtue of his servant, he submits those who love him to certain trials
to motivate the just rewards he has for them. Jephthah, on the other hand, a
man without virtue and without foresight, by a sentiment of religion
misunderstood, promises a sacrifice to God in these words: "I will offer a
burnt offering to God the first to come out of the door of my house and come in
front of me when I come back from the fight." (Judg. 11:31) Was he forced
to do this? or did he understand how he was to perform it? What would he have
done if he had introduced to him a dog, a donkey, which the law forbids
offering to the Lord, or the son or wife of another? Would he have fulfilled
his vow by rejoicing at the expense of others' pain? The judgment of God,
therefore, allowed this vow, the improvidence of which might be so fatal to
others, to fall back on itself; and Jephthah pushed blindness until he did not
recognize that he had made a reckless wish and that he had to go back on the
erroneous promise of which he was the author. He ought to have understood that
God cannot accept a similar sacrifice, request for his reckless conduct, and
offer to God a victim who was not contrary to the law; but he likes to become
better parricide by remaining faithful to his vow, without recollecting that
truth which a reckless and foolish promise, in order to be useful, can only be
fatal. He sacrificed himself by immolating his daughter, so God concealed his
disapproval of such a sacrifice. If he had positively forbidden it, he would
have seemed to want another victim to be sacrificed to him, while he knew that
Jephthah was unworthy and could not offer it to him. As for her daughter, death
was a gain for her, because in dying as an innocent victim of her father's
guilty wish, she avoided the pain of hell to which she might not have been able
to escape by prolonging her life. If we see the triumph crowning the efforts of
Jephthah, let us beware of attributing it to his own merit or that of his army,
for we do not read that they prayed to God to give them a defender. Besides,
had God given this mission to Jephthah? had he spoken to him? No, but as the
foreign nations exalted the power of their gods, as if they had subjected them
to the children of Rael and had only insults for the God of Abraham, God
exercised his vengeance against these natives not for his people, who was
unworthy of it, but for the honor of his name in view of the merits of Abraham
and for his sanctuary. So when we see the spirit of God seize Samson, who gave
himself up to a courtesan, shall we say that he was worthy? No, but this grace
was given to him only for the destruction of enemy nations. (Judg. 14:6; 15:14)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

AND SHOULD IT BE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS A PRIEST?</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">There are some among us who, busy
with worldly affairs or little zeal for the study of the Holy Scriptures,
support this erroneous view that Samuel was a priest, that is to say,
descendant of Aaron, whose sons, according to God's command, were born and did
not priests. They had only the privilege of offering incense on the altar.
Others push the error further; they admit that Samuel was not of the race of
Aaron, that is to say, he was not born a priest, and they do not fail to affirm
that he has fulfilled the priestly functions. It is to these that we must first
answer, for it is more absurd to affirm that Samuel fulfilled the priestly
functions without being born a priest than to maintain that he was a priest as
a descendant of Aaron. On one side there is only ignorance, on the other there
is unreason. When we have proved to those who think that Samuel was born a
priest that he was not of the race of Aaron, they will be convinced that he was
not clothed with the priesthood, for they seem to be ignorant that the children
of Aaron were permitted to perform the priestly functions, a truth of which
Scripture gives us clear evidence. Thus Korah, who was not Aaron's children,
who wanted to offer incense on the altar, the earth opened under his feet and
swallowed him up with those who had joined him. (Num. 16:31) And Uzziah the
king, who was also not of the tribe of Aaron, but of the tribe of Judah, having
dared to usurp the priestly offices by appearing before the altar, was struck
with leprosy on the forehead and remained leprous until the day of his death.
(2 Kgs. 15:5; 2 Chron. 26:21) As for those who claim that Samuel, without being
a priest by right of birth, did not fail to fulfill his functions, their
opinion is rather unreasonable, and it is not a mediocre job to persuade the
truth to a fool. What, indeed, is their folly to maintain that it is night
while the sun pours streams of light on the earth? They read, and not in one
right, that God established by law that the functions of the priesthood would
be exclusively reserved for Aaron and his children, and they stubbornly
maintain that Samuel was a priest. They do not understand that if Samuel
fulfilled the priestly functions, without holding this right of his birth, he
is a usurper, because God has established that this right would come from birth,
and not from the will of men. It is even more than boldness to conceive this
opinion of Samuel. How can one suppose, indeed, that a man so worthy of esteem,
so commendable to the very testimony of God, would have dared to seize
functions which he knew were forbidden to him? Besides, he does not know with
what rigor God has more than once celebrated this recklessness. He could not
claim that dignity by a special concession of God, which he knew to be
undisputable in his decrees, and if this concession had been made to him, he
would have rather regarded it as a temptation, in the belief that it was that
God could not in any way return to what He had established. He would have
thought rather that it was the devil who granted him this right under the
appearance and in the name of God, to believe that God had changed his decrees.
When God forbade Balaam to go to Balac and asked him again if he could go to
the invitation that was made to him (Num. 22:19), God, angry with him, he took
it again by the mouth of an angel, for this animal, seeing the angel who was
opposing his passage, no longer wished to advance. Now, Balaam, asking God
again, who had forbidden him to undertake this journey, if he consented to his
departure, judged of God as of a man who, by the same as he cannot foresee the
future, is changeable and variable in his designs. But Balaam has no testimony
from heaven for him, for he was a diviner. Samuel, on the contrary, was a man
loved by God, and knowing the invariability of his decrees; how could he have
believed that he was permitted to act against such a clearly established law? It
was, they say, after the death of Heli and his sons, who were priests, that
Samuel began to fulfill the priestly functions. That's what history does not
say, that's what reason cannot admit. Those who advance this opinion are
obliged to suppose that there was then no one who could exercise the priestly
functions, and that after the death of Eli and his two sons, the priesthood
would have ceased to exist if Samuel had not sacrificed himself to God. Such a
feeling is offensive to God, because those who support him seem to accuse him
of improvidence by instituting a ministry which could not have duration. Why,
indeed, establish that none other than the children of Aaron could perpetually
fulfill the priestly functions until the time of the advent of Christ, if he
knew that this priesthood should fail? If, on the contrary, he did not know it
(and far from us this thought), he was therefore without foresight, then he
could also be made that in the absence of these legitimate priests Samuel did
not exercise the functions of the priesthood. But if one is forced to admit the
providence and prescience of God, what he has established must have remained,
and if so, Samuel did not exercise the priesthood, because he was not a priest.
In the old law, indeed, and according to the established order of God, the
priesthood was attached to birth; in the news, God has established that the
priests would be instituted. Let them choose one of these two things, whether
they prove that Samuel was born a priest or that he became a priest. Now they
confess that he is not born a priest, because they know that he is not of the
family of Aaron. So if Samuel is not a priest by birth, and if we do not read,
if we cannot prove that God had prescribed to establish priests apart from the
family of Aaron, the rigorous conclusion Samuel was not a priest. Nevertheless,
the contradictors persist in closing their eyes to the evidence; or, they say,
Samuel was not a priest, but he fulfilled the functions, since we read that he
offered a sacrifice to God. (1 Sam. 7:9-10) Who will dare to oppose this
testimony of the holy books? Yes, Samuel offered a sacrifice to God, but it
does not follow that he exercised the priestly ministry. It is said every day
that a man offers a sacrifice when he hands over to the priest the victims whom
he places on the altar; and it is in this sense that Samuel offered it himself,
that is, through the priest, as is done every day. Scripture also says of
David, Solomon, and so many others, that they have sacrificed, are we to say
that all have performed priestly functions? The priest, it is true, performs
his own ministry, yet the very act of sacrifice is attributed to him in whose
name the priest sacrificed, in other words, he is attributed to the one who
presents the sacramental victims. How, indeed, he who was not a priest could
have held the place of a priest? Can a deacon replace a priest? A prefect may
replace a prefect, a lender take the place of a lender, but a private man
cannot replace any authority; how much less can one who is not a priest replace
a priest? For what purpose could he aspire to the exercise of a ministry which
he knows to be forbidden to him? If a priest comes to fail in one place, or ask
another to come and replace him; but no prophet, no saint, will ever do a thing
that he knows to be forbidden to him. A holy life, indeed, does not carry the
power to exercise any ministry. Just as the priest cannot base on his character
alone the esteem he wants us to make of his life; he whose life is holy and the
pure manners cannot hope to find there the right to exercise the priestly
ministry. The priesthood is a good institution, it is true, but it becomes an
evil thing for the one who pretends to exercise it without any right. If we
carefully consider what is written by Samuel, we shall see that testimony
testifies to him the Scripture: "And all the people knew," he said,
"that Samuel was the faithful prophet of the Lord.” (1 Sam. 3:20) And in
the book of Psalms: "May Moses and Aaron be his priests, and Samuel the number
of those who call on his name." (Ps. 98:6) Who does not see this
distinction that these characters are separated by their different dignities;
that is to say, we see Moses and Aaron clothed with priestly dignity, and
Samuel, among the prophets, is deemed worthy to invoke by his prayers the
protection of God over his people, as he did indeed. (1 Sam. 7:9) - The
priests, moreover, were so little lacking, that when the ark was brought back
from the Philistines, carried by the Levites, the inhabitants of Bethsamea offered
sacrifices to God in Samuel's absence; and when Saul became king, Ahimaas,
grandson of the high priest Heli, wore the ephod. Now, they will say, it is
precisely the proof that Samuel was a priest, for he was clothed with the
ephod. But are today deacons not clothed with dalmatics like the bishops? We
also read that David was clothed with the ephod (2 Sam. 6:14), and a double
ephod. Samuel, still a tiny child, was himself wearing the ephod (1 Sam. 6:18),
Could he at this age offer to God the gifts of the people? You see, then, that
this name of ephod has different meanings. The priests wore the ephod, but did
not wear it, while it was the garment. The ephod means sometimes a garment,
sometimes a kind of ornament that the priests wore to consult the Lord. So far
as we seem, we proved that Samuel was not a priest, but a prophet. We now have
to answer those who think that Samuel was a priest, because they do not know
that Samuel was not one of Aaron's children, for it was not permissible for a
descendant of Aaron not to practice the priestly ministry. I want to prove to
them first of all that if Samuel was a priest, his father Helcana undoubtedly
had to be, as well as the sons of Samuel. Now, a proof that they were not
priests, is that he made them judges over the children of Israel, as Samuel
himself was. We read "that he judged the children of Israel."
Helcana, Samuel's father, was not a priest either, because, says the Scripture:
"He went from the city called Ramathaim to the ordained days to worship
the Lord and offer sacrifices to the almighty God of hosts, and there were the
two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord. "(1 Sam. 1:3)
Can it be more clearly established that at the appointed time, Elenahana
offered sacrifices to the Lord by the hand of the priests, according to the
prescriptions of Moses, according to which the Hebrews were to offer victims
and tithes of their property three times a year, where was the ark and the
priests of the Lord? Besides, he had two women at the same time, which was
forbidden to priests. Indeed, Helcana was one of the Levites, as indicated by
the following genealogies in the book Chronicles. (1 Chron. 6) The Levites did
not yet have specific functions to fulfill with the priests and the ark of the
Lord. David, during his reign, thus divides the sacred functions between
priests and Levites. From the age of twenty and above, and according to the law
for twenty-five years and above, they had to begin to minister in sacred
ceremonies. He instituted among the children of Aaron, that is to say among the
descendants of Phinees and Thamar, twenty-four classes of priests to perform
alternately their ministry at certain times. He also appointed Levites to be
porters of the tabernacle, to carry the ark of the Lord, to guard the holy
place and sacred vessels, and to receive the mass of offerings. He also
instituted twenty-four classes of cantors, harp players, and other musicians,
who filled their offices in their turn, because they had to be allowed some
rest and time to take care of their household affairs. Now, not only do these
details contribute to establish the truth that we seek to prove, that is,
Samuel was not Aaron's children, but the very promise his mother made to the
Lord is a new proof: "If you give me a son," she told him, "I
will give it to the Lord every day of my life.” (1 Sam. 1:11) Now she would not
have spoken this language if he had been a priest by right of birth; it would
have been necessarily devoted to the service of the altars. But he was only
Levite, and there was still no special law for the Levites; each one did what
he wanted, and often they engaged in the paths of error and iniquity. Thus
Jonathan, the grandson of Moses, who was among the Levites, took it upon
himself to attribute the priesthood to the tribe of Dan. This is why we read in
the book of Judges, "At that time there was no king in Israel; but
everyone did everything that seemed good to him.” (Judg. 17:6) And so Hannah
consecrated Samuel to God, saying, "I put this child into the hands of the
Lord" so that he would not be exposed to going astray like the others.
Finally, to deal with this question in all its aspects, let us still discuss
what is said of Helcana, and that he came to ordinary days to offer sacrifices
and tithe of his goods. How could he offer the tithe of his goods since he
possessed nothing? For the Levites had no part in the division of the lands,
because they were to live on tithes which the people gave them. But it can be
done, and this opinion is based, that he possessed the property of his wife or
others that he would have bought, because not only the Levites, but the others
and the priests themselves were taking wives in other tribes. Thus we see the
High Priest Jehoiada take for wife the daughter of King Joram, of the tribe of
Jude. (2 Chron. 22:11)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

judgments of God; it is at the school of these judgments that the weakness or
ignorance of men must learn from what they do not understand, and convince
themselves that they are the expression of truth; therefore God must not have
acted otherwise than He has acted, since we know that there is no acceptance of
persons in him. (Acts 10:34) He answered David's prayer, he rejected that of
Saul, he did not commit any injustice in it. He knew in what internal dispositions
each of them prayed to him. He therefore answered the prayer of one who
implored his pardon with a contrite and humbled heart, and rejected the prayer
of him who had closed his soul to all repentance. God, in fact, gives more
attention to the feelings of the heart than to the words that come from the
mouth; he declares it in his own words: "Man," he says, "sees
what appears, but God looks at the heart." (l Sam. 16:7) What misleads us
is that we leave ourselves to deceive by the pretense of language or a lying
exterior, because we cannot see what is going on in the heart. We must
therefore follow the judgment of God who examines men in the most intimate of
the heart, where the real feelings are. This is what the Savior himself did, as
we see in the Gospel. He does not wish to receive among his disciples a scribe
who offers himself to him (Matt. 8:19), and he calls after him Levi who sat in
the house of the tax-collectors (Matt. 9:17; Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27), because the
feelings of this scribe were not in harmony with his words; Levi, on the other
hand, without saying a single word, had in his heart what the scribe had only
on his lips. Now Jesus, according to what is written, knew what is in man (Jn.
2:25), chooses Levi. Moreover, David did not ask as Saul, but he implored his
forgiveness in the feelings of a heart deeply contrite and humiliated.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

David was not unaware that the royal dignity was of divine origin, and as long
as he sees Saul clothed with this dignity, he honors him in this excellence so
as not to appear to be wanting to God who does a duty of these honors to the
respect of kings. The king, indeed, is the image of God, as the bishop is the
image of Christ. As long as he occupies this high rank, he must be honored, if
not for himself, at least for the dignity with which he is clothed. This is the
Apostle's recommendation: "Be subject to the higher powers. There is no
power that is not of God, and those that are, have been ordained of God.” (Rom.
13:1) This is why we honor a pagan man constituted in dignity, though
personally unworthy of him, who, taking God's place, pays his homage to the
devil. Power is entitled to the honors we pay him and he deserves them. This is
why God revealed in dreams to Pharaoh his future years of famine (Gen. 42:26),
and that only of all those who were present with him he saw the Son of God in
the fiery furnace (Dan. 3), thanks, no doubt, to his personal merits, he who
wished to be adored in an idol, but to the excellence of the royal dignity with

HE REALLY APPEAR BEFORE HER, AND DID HE SAY TO SAUL THE WORDS WHICH THE BOOK OF
KINGS RELATES? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
This fact seems to me scarcely worthy if one sticks to the simple words of the
historical narrative. How can one admit that the power of magical art has
forced the appearance of a man as holy in his works as in his birth? or that
without being forced to it he appeared voluntarily? It is absurd to admit one
or the other of these suppositions in this just man. If he has been mentioned in
spite of himself, then justice has no power; if he consented to this evocation,
he lost the merit of these virtues he had practiced during his mortal life;
absurd consequence, for he who comes out of this life into righteousness
perseveres in it. Now Satan's tricks go so far that to deceive a greater number
he wants to appear to hold the good under his power. This is what the Apostle
wants us to hear through these words: "Satan himself is transformed into
an angel of light.” (2 Cor. 11:14) In order to accredit an error which turned
to his glory, he disguised himself under the exterior and the name of a
righteous man, to show thus the little foundation of the hope given to the
servants from God, since the righteous who came out of this life were subject to
his own child. Some are deceived here because he has told the truth about the
death of Saul and his sons, as if it were difficult for the devil to foresee
before death and the death of the body, especially since warning signs are
manifested to those whose death is near, because the protection of God seems to
have withdrawn from them. How much more must we suppose this knowledge in the
devil, whose prophetic oracles retrace to us the sublime dignity above all the
angels and of which the Apostle said: "Do you therefore ignore the heights
of Satan?" (Rev. 2:24, 2 Cor. 2:11) How is it astonishing that he could
have foreseen the death of Saul, when this prediction served to deceive men and
to be adored as clothed in his power? Saul pushed madness and stupidity to
resort to the enchantments of a witch. The depreciation of his heart made him
use sacrilegious means which he himself had condemned. If, out of respect for
history, we do not think we ought to pass lightly on the literal account of the
facts, we will be right, provided we do not conclude with the reality of these
facts, but only with what impresses on the eyes and mind. Saul, reprobate of
God, could not have a true and righteous spirit. The historian describes the
provisions of Saul and the exterior of Samuel; he recounts the words that were
said, the appearances that are glaring in the eyes, but without saying whether
these appearances are in conformity with the truth or not. What does he say,
indeed? Saul, learning in what form appeared the one he had asked,
"understood that it was Samuel." (1 Sam. 28:14) The historian tells
what was Saul's thought, and how that thought was not good. He adored another
than God against the defense of Scripture, in the thought that it was Samuel,
and he adored the devil, who thus collected the fruit of his tricks; for the
purpose of all his efforts is to be adored as God. If Samuel had really
appeared to Saul, this righteous man would not have allowed him to be
worshiped, he who had taught that adoration was only due to God alone. How
besides this man of God was with Abraham, in the abode of happiness, could he
say to that guilty man worthy of the flames of hell: "You will be with me
tomorrow”? Satan betrays here doubly the subtlety of his tricks; he allows us
to worship him under the exterior and the name of Samuel against the express
defense of the law, and in spite of the immense distance which separates the
sinners from the just, he falsely proves to a man charged with iniquities that
he will share the happiness of the most just of men. These words would be true
if Samuel's name were not mixed in, because in reality Saul had to be with the
devil. He went to find the one he had loved. The demon may disguise himself,
but he is always betrayed by actions contrary to the character of the persons
whose instruments he wishes to deceive.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

me a very difficult thing," does not fail to add: "If, however, you
see me when I am taken away from you, you will have what you have asked
for." He had not refused him an absolute refusal, he only taught him that
he would obtain according to his merit rather than according to his request.
Scripture, in fact, means that many things must be understood so that the
meaning which results from the expressions is not contrary to the principles of
religion. This indiscreet request must have had no effect; but because Elisha
reads it only by the desire of good, God, who knows what he ought to give to
each, would not be deprived of the goods which he was worthy of receiving. Let
us now see if Elijah deserved to have Elisha receive a double portion of the
spirit that he himself had. The Holy Spirit made known to Zechariah what would
be the greatness and merit of John. "He will come," said he, "in
the spirit and virtue of Elijah. (Luke 1:17) He tells him that John will be the
equal of Elijah, and Our Lord says on his side: "No one has risen from the
children of women greater than John the Baptist. (Matt. 11:11.) He does not
say, He is greater than all, but: "No one is greater than he;” That is,
one can be his equal, one cannot be superior to him. Elijah is therefore equal
to him, and is not inferior to anyone; How can Elisha be greater than he, since
John, who has no one above him, is equal to Elijah? For when he arrived on the
banks of the Jordan, the waters would not yield to his word to give him
passage, if he had not invoked the name of Elijah (2 Kgs. 2:14), God not
wanting to let him believe that he had received the effect of his indiscreet
request, because the measure of the spirit which had been accorded to Elijah
was not sufficient for the time he lived.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">ON TOBIT. </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The providence of the
Lord God towards us is so great that, not wanting us to err, he gave us the law
and examples of good works, so that, following them, one may lead an honest and
peaceful life with the fear of God. For he who is the maker of life naturally
does not wish his work to be subject to death. Although nature itself is not
devoid of law, the Lord, being good and merciful, wanted us to have greater
knowledge of the things to be pursued and of the things to be avoided, and to
this end he showed them through texts and examples, as the present reading attests.
Therefore God's servant holy Tobit was given to us, after the law, as an
example, so that we may know how the things we have read are done, and so that,
if trials come, we may not desist from the fear of God, and that we may not
hope for help from any other source than from him, keeping in mind that it is
written, "I have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen the just
forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread" (Ps. 36:25). Therefore he who hopes
in God with all his mind can never be deceived. Even if tribulations arise for
a time through Satan's maneuvers, the examples of holy men teach us that these
things are permitted by God only for the sake of increasing our rewards;
because if we bear tribulations with composure, we shall here be given consolation
with effect, and in the future we shall be given eternal life with glory. For
because our God is just and there is no respect of persons with him (Rom.
2:11), he lets us be tested, because he loves us, so that he may give us
immense rewards after the hardship. Indeed, when the apostle was praying for
his trials to cease, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you;
for power is made perfect in infirmity". As a reaction to this the apostle
said, "When I am weak, then am I stronger", and "I rejoice in my
tribulations," he said, "that the power of Christ may dwell in
me" (2 Cor. 12:9-10). So, let us be informed by the Scripture of how
praiseworthy holy Tobit is, whose devotion captivity did not diminish, whom the
loss of his eyes did not stop from blessing God, whom the exhaustion of his
resources did not divert from the way of justice and truth (Tob. 1-3). Indeed,
need tests a just man and proves him to be just, and keeping fairness when in
poverty is the true and perfect justice. From things that diminish the devotion
of some, praiseworthy Tobit gained an increase of it. For want, he says,
humiliates a man, and he who is humiliated cannot keep justice. But holy
Tobit's spirit, intent on God, was neither broken by captivity nor humiliated
by want, because he buried the bodies of the slain in spite of the prohibition,
and, certain of God's generosity, he was compassionate even with the small
means that he had, knowing that God prefers the compassion that is done from
small means, as did the widow whom the Lord praised in the Gospel (Luke
21:2-4). For the truly faithful person, the person who does not doubt God's
promises, is the one who gives generously from little. Therefore, comforting
his heart with the hope of the future, Tobit, devoted to God, was found to be
strong and brave in trial, showing that, when in want, one ought to be all the
more vigilant in God's fear, because if want does not prompt you to seek God's
help, how much less will security? Therefore holy men, certain that God has reserved
for himself the judgement of all that is done in this world, not only have not
been vexed about tribulations, losses, and other calamities or reproaches, but
they have even accepted them with gratitude, as did our apostles, who after
being beaten rejoiced that they had been accounted worthy to suffer reproach
for the name of Christ (Acts 5:41). Indeed, the calamities that unjustly strike
the faithful, whether in tribulations or in reproaches, are the signs of future
rewards. Therefore just Tobit was so pleasing to God that he obtained for his
merits a twofold reward: for the present he recovered, through the angel's
agency, the sight that he had lost, and was also enriched with the resources
that are useful in this life; and for the future he was made an heir of the
kingdom of heaven: so that we might be taught through this that when someone
obeys God's law with all their heart and does not doubt his promises, God often
augments their resources in this world, and grants them eternal life in the
next. There is also something else that invites us to compliance with God's
law: holy Tobit did not only obtain the rewards of his own justice, because
there is added to the sum of his glory also something from the good actions of
those who behave as his imitators. For examples are praised in their imitators.
This can happen to us as well if we live in such a way that it becomes
appropriate for us to have imitators too.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">ON JOB. </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
How great, my dear brothers, is the love of Almighty God for mankind; when it
is well understood it serves to lead men into the kingdom of heaven; for want
of understanding it, on the contrary, we go down into the underworld. God wants
His graces to be pleasing and fruitful to us; he wants us to find our advantage
and to satisfy his desire to have mercy. It is therefore because of his
goodness and that will that he has all men saved that he has given us an
example of perfect justice in the person of his servant Job, as you are taught
by the reading we have just done. By imitating this example we will be freed
from evil, and we will be able to attain the highest good, and not only be
delivered from punishment, but obtain eternal rewards. How admirable is this
holy patriarch Job, who even before the written law, shows in his works an
accomplished example of the observance of the law, and who, without having been
to the school of any master, under the inspiration of nature in which God has
engraved the first principles of justice, has preserved for his Creator a
religion full of devotion and obedience. What praises is he not worthy, and by
what words can we celebrate the works of this man, of whom we cannot find the
like, neither before nor after the law? A man can walk in his footsteps, but he
cannot enter into comparison with him, nor can it be said that he is like him,
for he did not open the way this way first, he only follows the one who
preceded it. The holy man Job, on the contrary, has shown himself such without
ever having seen, having never read anything of the kind; he did not imitate
the conduct of others; it is he, on the contrary, who becomes their model and
gives them the example of those admissible actions in which God Himself finds
his complaisance. So the Lord himself gave him this glorious testimony:
"Have you noticed my servant Job," he said to Satan? “that there is not
a servant of God like him on the earth. (Job 1:8.) Who could have deserved the
extraordinary privilege that the Lord bore witness to him, except he who did
not imitate the example of another, but who walked first in the way he entered?
Then we conclude that he worshiped God in truth. There is no semblance of truth
as such in the one who has not been preceded by no one in the way he walks. Any
man who wants to pretend the fact in things where he is only imitator. And yet
what remains to be said is far superior to these first merits. In these virtues
so praiseworthy, we do not see the trials of tribulations, but a soul
inviolably attached to the service of God, and a loyalty to any test in the
observance of his law. The tempter did not find that the measure was full
enough to obtain the crown which rewards the merits; he therefore asked God to
subject Job's virtue to various temptations, to enslave him and embarrass him
in the bonds of misfortune and drag him beyond the bounds. As no man can bear
the weight of all the torments together, the guilty are subjected to separate
tortures to extract from them the confession of their crimes. God therefore
allowed the tempter to destroy all that belonged to his servant, and to destroy
everything to his children. The devil hoped that if Job bore the loss of his
oxen without complaining, he would not bear the loss of his flocks of sheep, or
at least the loss of his camels, of his servants, of all his riches; or,
finally, that if he had a soul large enough and a religion so pure as not to
succumb to these calamities, his soul would be overcome by paternal tenderness
and broken heart when he learned that all his children had died as victims by
the same disaster. But as before even the proclamation of the written law, he
carried the law engraved in his heart, none of these flames, none of these
losses did not weaken the deep feeling of religion which he professed for God,
and he thus gave to all men the example of loving God with all their heart
above all things. What glory, then, is not he who, before the law, observed the
law faithfully, and who, before this law was given to men, taught them not by
his words, but by his actions, how they should observe him? Now the tempter
pushed his boldness so far as not to find sufficient for the glory of this just
man, so many misfortunes united; he therefore wished to subject him to a more
terrible trial, which he knew to be above the forces of man; he asked God again
that he allowed him to strike Job with a frightful ulcer from head to foot.
(Job 2:5) God allowed him; but as this spirit of malice must not be trusted, he
commanded him to respect Job's soul, and not to use violence against him whose
reason he could not overcome. No sooner had he received this power than by a
more violent excess of cruelty he struck this just man with a horrible disease,
so that his whole body was not a wound, which could never have been borne
another than Job, who won a complete victory over Satan. As this cruelty of the
devil could not snatch from this holy man the slightest murmur against God,
Satan remembered the trick he had used formerly to deceive Adam; he tried to
shake Job's loyalty with his wife, for one is generally more accessible to the
seductions that come from within. But none of these means succeeds in this
spirit of boldness; he found there only a new and shameful defeat; but the servant
of God alone remained steadfast, but he kept a school of virtue. In this end of
all evils, he did not content himself with persevering in the fear of God, but
he severely reproved his wife, who wished to inspire him with contrary
sentiments, and showed him that we must bear with courage all the events which
only arrive by God's permission. It was a double punishment for Satan who was
thus deceived in his predictions; he could not shake Job's loyalty as he
wished, and his envy only led him to teach others what the devil did not want
him to know himself. Indeed, this story fully teaches us how much temptation is
useful to the servants of God, and fatal to the devil. While he hopes to be
able to harm them, he makes the faith more brilliant, and the example of one
persecuted by him becomes for many an eloquent exhortation to virtue. The
protection of God, who surrounds the righteous in the midst of his trials,
gives him a great number of imitators. The devil loses by wanting to win.
Always his fury is harmful to him. He persecutes the righteous to make them
lose their crown, and he only makes them more fortifications. Envy excites him
against the holy man Job, and he only doubled his reward in heaven and on
earth. God more than ever filled Job with all good things, and gave him a place
in heaven by the Savior. Thus all these trials turn to the glory of the saints
and to the punishment of the devil.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE FIRST PSALM.</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">
</span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— "Blessed is the man who did not
stop in the way of sinners.” If he stops there, he stops being blessed to
become guilty and worthy of punishment. Yet he still retains some hope of
amendment, because he is not impious, but simply sinful. If a man is found who
has not entered the council of the wicked and has not stopped in the way of
sinners, he is doubly blessed. For he cannot be blessed, if without entering
into the counsel of the wicked, he stops in the path of sinners, because if he
does not then have a complete ruin, he is nevertheless worthy of punishment.
The Psalmist adds: "nor sits in the seat of scoffers." Happiness,
according to him, consists of these three degrees together, and is based on a
triple reason, not to enter the counsel of the ungodly, not stopping in the
path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but, as we see in the first
two degrees only two kinds of people, the ungodly and the sinners to whom this
third degree applies: "Nor sits in the seat of scoffers?" Is it to
the impious or the sinners? Let us first see what it is to sit in the seat of
scoffers, and then we will understand better who this last line applies to. We
call the seat of scoffers that which arises outside the order of God, which has
been established only to issue unjust judgments, and that is called the
scoffers chair, because from it comes the corruption that causes death, as the
iniquity produces damnation. This seat cannot therefore come from God. Moses
was established in a chair of life, God raised this seat to retain the
authority of the righteous Judge and the Creator God. This is what makes Our
Lord say: "The scribes and Pharisees sit on the chair of Moses.” (Matt.
23:2) And to the Apostle: "There is no power that is not of God, and those
that are, have been ordained of God.” (Rom. 13:1) Also see what the same
Apostle said to the high priest: "You are sitting to judge me according to
the law, and against the law you command me to be struck.” (Acts 23:3) These
words, "According to the law," show the just and holy authority of
the law; and those which follow: These words, "According to the law,"
show the just and holy authority of the law; and those that follow: "And
against the law; you order me to be hit," the injustice of the judge, who
even in the seat of God rendered his judgments of iniquity. We read in the
prophet Daniel: "The kingdoms belong to God, and he gives them to whom he
pleases.” (Dan. 4:14) Just as the authority of a king of the earth imposes
itself upon all his subjects and inspires them with the respect due to him, so
according to the divine institution, the authority God is personified in the
king and exerted through him on all men. Often, it is true, the world does not
understand this truth, and submits to powers other than those which God has
established; yet the divine institution is that only one has the right to the
respect and homage of men. The authority of one God is never rejected except by
those who teach men to fear and respect many gods. These are those who sit in
the chair of scoffers, for the doctrine that their priests preach is a doctrine
of death. All their efforts tend to make the worshipers of one God devoted to
scorn or death as fools and enemies. This is the object of their impiety, and
it still extends to other crimes which bring out all the enormity. Thus, it was
by the order of Jezebel that priests of iniquity seated themselves in the seat
of scoffers, to wreak the loss of the innocent Naboth, and by means of false
suborned witnesses, pronounced against him, without being his judges, a
sentence of death. (2 Kgs. 21:11) This is why it is written in another Psalm:
"I will not sit with the wicked." (Ps. 25:5) The judgment is here of
the same nature as the one who sits in the seat of scoffers. If those who sit
in the pulpit of God come to oppress the innocent, their judgment is unjust,
but not the seat. But from the seat of scoffers, only iniquitous judgments can
come forth, although they cover them with certain appearances which disguise
their impiety and deceive the eyes. That impiety alone is proposed, it will find
no buyer, and if the preachers of the doctrine of the devil come to pronounce
his name, they make horror. In order to disguise the poison, honey is added to
it; they mix with the doctrine of the devil some proverbs of justice, which
they cover with the name of truth. We must therefore examine here the
intentions and the thought of each, because often he states a truth to better
illusion, and thus allow its pernicious errors. We have affirmed that the seat
of scoffers was outside the institution of God, and therefore we call seats of
scoffers those who are raised outside of the Church or against the Church. A
reckless presumption in the use of permitted things is a crime. How much more
is the overthrow of the tradition of the one whose siege is seized? In fact,
they destroy the order which we see beginning at the Apostle St. Peter, and
which has continued to us by an unbroken succession of bridges; they assume a
dignity without origin, that is to say, they present a body without head, their
seat is therefore rightly called a seat of scoffers. And that they do not count
on liberty, because they cover themselves here with the name of God. We know in
fact that they put their opposition under the protection of the name of God.
Surely it is not the zeal of God that presses them, they just want to defend
their places. Now, we know that Korah and the two hundred and fifty Israelites
who dared to offer a rash incense to God were swallowed up by the earth that
opened under their feet (Num. 16:31-35), and that King Uzziah having wanted to
seize priestly functions against the law, was struck on the brow of leprosy. (2
Kgs. 15:5, 2 Chron. 26:21) It is therefore well established that the seat of
scoffers is that impiety of which we have just spoken. Let's see what happens
next. The Psalmist adds: "But who puts his will into the law of the
Lord." (Psalm 1:2) His will is in the law of the Lord, because he despises
the ungodly, separates himself from the sinners and the seat of scoffers, and
puts all his affection in the law of God. So the Psalmist proclaims him
blessed. He adds, "And he meditates on this law day and night." It is
evident that free from all seductions, free from all that is opposed to the law
of God, he is continually exercised in the practice of this law, and fortunate
by the sacraments of the Son of God, he consecrates the day to good works and
night to prayer. It is from him of whom it is said in the Song of Songs,
"Let him sleep, but let his heart watch.” (Songs 5:2) So the Psalmist
adds: "And he shall be like a tree planted by a stream of water." Who
can doubt that he who makes the law of God the subject of his meditations, has
no certain hope? As a tree planted along the water cannot remain barren, so he
who continually meditates on the law of God is certain to see the blessings of
his works. "And he will bear fruit in his time." Says the Psalmist,
"Every well-directed plantation gives fruits in its time,” so he who obeys
the law of God will also produce fruit at the appointed time, and will receive
the fruit of his zeal and devotion when Our Lord Jesus Christ will begin to
judge the living and the dead, and the Psalmist adds, "And his leaves will
not fall." This tree whose leaves do not fall clearly signifies the sap of
life of which it is full. It is the running water that sprinkles and feeds him
that he must keep his leaves. Our Lord Jesus Christ said, "If you treat
green wood like this, what will dry wood be made of?” (Luke 23:31) Green wood
is here the symbol of life and the fruits it produces. Just as a tree, thanks
to the running water that feeds its roots, does not feel the drought, so that
which applies to the meditation of the law of God, even when temptation comes
to test him, strong in the help of God, far from losing, he obtains eternal
salvation, according to these words of the Apostle: "It is by many
tribulations that we must enter in the kingdom of God." (Acts 14:21)
"And all he does will prosper.” These words are clear, that he who remains
faithful to the law of God, and who puts his delights to fulfill his
commandments, will see success crowning all his actions; so that all that
Joseph did was prosperous, as a reward for his having preferred the fear of God
to life itself; it is not so, no, it is not so with the wicked. (Ps 1:4) This
repetition means that the fate which he predicts to the ungodly will be
invariable; they have no happiness to expect for the future, and will only
receive misfortunes until death. This is why the Psalmist adds: "They will
be like the dust that the wind scatters from the face of the earth."
(Ibid. 4) Thus the wicked will perish like the dust that the wind carries off
from above the face of the earth, to annihilate it: in fact, the dust carried
off from the earth, which was its support, disperses through the air and annihilates
itself insensibly, thus the impious rejected by the angels before the face of
God, their Creator, the only principle of life, perished forever. "And the
wicked will not be raised in the day of judgment." (Ibid. 5) These words
are worthy of attention. Judgment, they who did not want to be given any work
of God which they could account for the law of God was for them an object of
contempt and denial, they cannot therefore before the court of God render any
according to the law given to them, so convinced of arrogance and revolt
against God, they will rise only to see the truth of what they did not want to
believe, and to perish forever, because they dared to accuse God of falsehood.
"Neither the sinners in the assembly of the righteous." The Psalmist
represents here three kinds of men, the ungodly, the sinners, and the just, in
the order followed by the error. As for the ungodly, they are quite foreign to
the righteous, because as we said, they did not want to live under the law of
God. The wretches who live under the law of God will be cited before the
tribunal of Jesus Christ, and separated from the righteous to give account of
the commandments of the law which they have received, and that they did not put
into practice to obtain the approval of God and to avoid his reproaches. For
the righteous who have applied themselves with holy activity to the fulfillment
of the law, they will obtain the reward. "For God knows the paths of the
righteous. (Ibid. 6) In the language of Scripture, God knows those who remember
his precepts, and engage in the practice of good works to obtain the crown he
reserves for the righteous. As for those who have made a game of forgetting God
and neglecting the salvation of their soul, he will say to them: "Depart,
I do not know you, workers of iniquity.” (Luke 13:27) "And the way of the
wicked will perish.” This psalm ends as it began, and it teaches us that the
wicked whose actions it has made known, have to wait for an eternal loss. As I
have pointed out, it is said of God that he knows the paths of the righteous,
because they walk in his law, and that the way of the wicked shall perish
because it is outside the law of God; for, says Solomon, all the ways of the
ungodly are covered with darkness (Prov. 4:19), while the way of the righteous
shines with a glowing light, under the guidance of Our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

“HE HAS PLACED,” SAYS THE PSALMIST, “HIS TENT IN THE SUN,” THAT IS TO SAY, HIS
BODY IN WHICH JESUS CHRIST DWELT, AND WHICH WAS DELIVERED BY PILATE TO THE

OF CHRIST: “THE FLOGGING SHALL NOT COME NEAR TO YOUR TABERNACLE,” (Ps. 40) </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">SINCE INDEED HE DECLARED THAT HIS
BODY WAS A TEMPLE.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> — The body of the son of man and the
Son of God is indeed a temple. Yet God, that is, the Son of God, though he came
in visible flesh, fixed his dwelling in the soul. The soul as well as the body
are therefore the tabernacle of the Son of God, although there is only one God
and man, the Son of God and the son of man. The blaze, therefore, has not
approached his tent in the sense that his soul, where his divinity lives, has
been freed from the torments of hell or the princes of hell. The torture of the
cross and the sufferings of the flesh, to which he had been condemned as
guilty, though he was innocent, made him fear that his soul might feel some
pain in the underworld; The Scripture, therefore, shows that the trouble was
not able to approach his soul in the underworld, because he descended to it,
that is to say, he allowed his sufferings only to confound the darkness, and to
convince madness of the princes of darkness. That's why the Lord says, "My
soul is sad unto death." (Matt. 26, Mark 14) The Savior abandons his soul
to the sadness that was in his nature, but it immediately wins the victory and
robs those who had upset her to the point of death, followed by an eternal joy,
and this text of the whole man can still be heard, because he who has not known
sin was not subject to torture. prescribed by law.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

ON PSALM 23. </span></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
</span></font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The title of this
psalm indicates the subject. Before speaking of the mysteries of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, he designates the day of the Lord: "To this David for the first
day of the week.” Saying, "To this David," he has in sight the one of
whom this David was the figure and of whom the prophet said, "And my son
David will lead them." (Ezek. 37:24) The first day of the Sabbath is the
first day of the week. Indeed, the first day following the Sabbath is the
Lord's day, as testified by the Evangelist: "On the first day of the week,
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the sepulcher, etc." (Matt. 28:1)
Now, this day of the Lord is the symbol of the mystery of the Savior, but to
expose this psalm following the logical order, the Psalmist begins with the person
of God the Father, so that the mystery of the divinity may be manifested to men
of God. He who wishes to treat any subject must take it in his principle, in
his origin, on pain of being unable either to make known his nature or to
persuade of its truth. The Prophet begins with these words: "The earth and
all that it contains is to the Lord." (Ps. 23:1) These words, "The
earth and all that it contains is to the Lord," are a profession of faith.
Here he follows the authority of the ancient saints who taught that the earth
and all that it contained was to the Lord. He adds: "The globe of the
earth and all who live in it are his.” He feared that he had not explained his
word enough, saying, "The earth and all that it contains is to the
Lord," he makes it clearer by saying: "The globe of the earth and all
those who live are his." He teaches us that all the earth without
exception is to the Lord, with all that it contains, and that there is
absolutely nothing that does not belong to him. There are heretics who support
the contrary and who, according to the apostle St. Peter, deny the sovereign
domain of God (2 Pet. 2:10), but they are condemned by the testimonies of the
prophets who testify that everything belongs to God. He founded it on the sea.
(Psalm 23:2) This is what he explains in another psalm where he says: "It
is you who have made the earth on the water.” (Ps.135:6) To give support to the
faith, he shows how it was done. In the midst of the confusion of all things,
while neither the earth nor the heavens had a definite form, the earth, by the
order of God, the earth became compact and was over water, so that the earth
and the water had a peculiar property, and conformed to their origin. This is
why God says in the book of Kings: "Is it not I who made the waters?"
“And he established it above the rivers.” (Ps. 23:2) It is established above
the rivers in that it contains the waters which are enclosed within it and
which, circulating through a thousand secret channels, give it the necessary
density so that excessive drought does not remove its consistency and make it
unfit for cultivation. These waters provide a vivifying sap to the roots of
trees and plants and at the same time freshness in dry places. The Psalmist
then shows the little usefulness of faith without a holy life: "Who will
go up on the mountain of the Lord, or who will stop in his holy place?” (Ibid.
3) He now exposes what must be the one who recognizes a creator God; he has
forewarned the punishment of those who deny the empire of God over all that
exists, he wants to learn now from those who confess this authority that they
cannot avoid themselves to be punished if their life is not in accordance with
their faith. This mountain of the Lord is heaven, which he says in another
psalm: "I raised my eyes to the mountains from which help is to come.” (Ps.
120:1) The place of the Lord is the place where he manifests himself. It was
said to Joshua when the Lord appeared to him, "The place where you are is
a holy place." (Josh. 5:16) Jacob said of where he saw God: "This is
the house of God." (Gen. 28:17) "He whose hands are innocent and the
heart pure." (Ps. 23:4) This is he whom he declares worthy to ascend on
the mountain of the Lord, that is to say in heaven, or to stop in his holy
place, the one whose works are innocent and the pure heart in the cause of God,
that is, in faith. It can rise in the sky and stop in its holy bond. Indeed, as
soon as he has left this life, he will ascend into heaven. And when the city of
Jerusalem comes down from heaven for the coming of the Lord, he will be worthy
to stop because of his innocence in the place where the Lord must judge the
living and the dead; while the wicked and the sinners will be unworthy to stop
in the holy place where God pronounces his judgments, because the ungodly ones
will rise again for their loss and the sinners for an eternal punishment. If
the sons of Israel, because of their sins, could not bear the brightness of
Moses' face when he came down from the mountain (Exod. 29:29), how much more
will a conscience charged with crimes fear? to raise your eyes to the Lord of
glory seated on the throne of his majesty, especially when he hears him say to
them: "I do not know you, the workman of iniquity. Who has not received
his soul in vain." (Ps. 23:4) He now indicates the different kinds of sins
from which one must be exempt. First, he is innocent and has a pure heart that
has not prostituted his soul to idolatry; for it is vanity par excellence, and
he who submits to it renders his soul a slave to corruption. "And who has
not made a deceitful oath to his neighbor.” He has contented himself with
indicating two essential duties, one with regard to God, the other to the
neighbor, because he who is faithful to these two commandments will also
fulfill all the others, to the testimony of the Lord Himself: He tells us to
“love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your strength. This is
the first commandment; and the second is like it: You will love your neighbor
as yourself. These two commandments contain all the law and the prophets.”
(Matt. 22:37) But who can love God with all his heart and not keep his law? Who
can have charity for his neighbor and indulge in sin, since the fear of God is
for him the principle of love of neighbor? "This is the one who will
receive from heaven the blessing and will obtain mercy from God his
Savior." (Ps. 23:5) Here is the reward of one who, faithful to his duties
towards God and man, his Creator and neighbor will have practiced faith and
charity, he will receive from the Lord a blessing that will cover him with
glory, and he will obtain mercy for those whom he has not been able to fulfill.
No one can take vigilance so far that he absolutely avoids all sin, but if he
has been attentive and faithful to perform the essential duties, he will obtain
from God mercy for less important things. The Psalmist gives God the name of
Savior because he does not want the death of the one who is going to die, but
rather that he is converted and lives. (Ezek. 18:32) "This is the
generation of those who seek it, of those who seek the face of the God of
Jacob.” (Ps. 23:6) It is one and the same generation who seeks, according to
the Psalmist, the Lord, and who seeks the face of the God of Jacob. This is not
without purpose, for although these two things are good, there are here two
very distinct degrees. It is good to seek God, but it is perfect to seek the
face of the God of Jacob. Indeed, the most worthy are those who stand before
the judge's face. Such, then, is the generation of these merits and of this
reward; it is the innocence and the purity of the heart which bring to this
bliss, as it is injustice and iniquity, that lead to perdition. There are
indeed two generations, the generation of iniquity, which is the mother of Cain,
and the generation of justice, which is the mother of Abel; one has faith and
pure life, the other infidelity and vice. These are the two laws of good and
evil, of God and of the devil, and one becomes the son of him whose law one
follows. Thus, the generation of those who seek the Lord is faith in God and
love of neighbor, as we have said. He who believes in God always seeks his
protection, and no one is unjust to men when one wishes to render himself
favorable God. This is what the Psalmist seems to indicate when he says,
"The God of Jacob, because God is known in Judea.” (Ps. 75:2) But why does
he say that they seek his face when God himself says to Moses: "You will
not be able to see my face?” (Exod. 33:20) If Moses sought, but in vain, to see
the face of the Lord, their search is useless, since they are no better than
Moses. We answer that no one seeks to see God unnecessarily, because the
Psalmist says here that they seek the face of God to make us understand that
they are worthy to see the one they seek. We know well who we look for when we
see his face; but as the face of God cannot be seen by mortal eyes, the
'Psalmist' designates this divine face under these expressions: The God of
Jacob. "<i>Diapsalma</i></font><font size="3">." (Ps.
23:7, Septuagint) This word </font><i><font size="3">diapsalma</font></i><font size="3">,
“pause,” indicates in this place a change of person. After what relates to the
person of God the Father, the Psalmist places the mystery of the Son of God in
order that the order that exists between the Father and the Son be perfectly
observed. The law was given by Moses to be like a teacher who was to instruct
men and prepare them for the school of righteousness to make himself worthy to
wait for the year of the Lord and the day of reward, that is, to say that those
who had faithfully preserved the hope of the coming of Christ would receive it
and thus escape safely in the aftermath of Adam's sin, because the advent of
the one they hoped for should give them the mercy that erases the sins where
they let themselves be carried away. This is what the Psalmist has said above:
"He will receive," he says, "the mercy of God his Savior. Raise
your doors, O princes," he exclaims. (Ibid. 7) It is the voice of the holy
angels of which it is said in the Gospel that they approached the Savior and
served him. (Matt. 4:11) Therefore they turn to the princes and powers against
whom the Apostle tells us that we have to fight (Eph. 6:12), and tell them to
raise the gates of their prince, that is to say, of the devil, who is the chief
of the erring princes, and by whom one descends into hell. These gates are the
infidelity and deceptive seductions of idolatry. "And you, eternal doors,
rise up.” These eternal gates are faith, hope, and charity, because one cannot
destroy preaching that is based on truth. These doors, on the contrary, which
are, as I have said, unbelief and the ploys of idolatry are only for a time,
because every lie is essentially transient. As soon as the truth is revealed,
it will give him the death blow. The Psalmist therefore asks them to lift the
doors of their prince from darkness, that is to say, to remove the error of the
plurality of the gods and to substitute faith in one God by Jesus Christ. The
Apostle declares that this is the object of his mission, to announce not only
to men but to princes and heavenly powers the mystery of one God in Jesus
Christ. (Eph. 3:9) "And the King of glory will come in.” (Ps. 23:7) He
asks that these deceptive doors of the devil, product of the lie and
presumption that inspired him to be equal to God, be raised to let in the King
of glory, who is Our Lord Jesus Christ. Indeed, faith in God cannot enter a
soul until it has rejected from it the error produced by the evasiveness of the
devil. These princes of whom we have spoken cannot receive Christ as king, who
preaches to them the faith in one God, before having rejected from them the
traditions of error and lies opposed to the unity of God, no only those which
have sprung up on earth, but the one which is the author of Satan, the chief of
these princes; for they sought to spread on earth the error they had
concentrated in heaven under the inspiration of the devil, that is to say, to
proclaim themselves gods by a lie which is the image of the devil. "Who is
this king of glory?” (Ibid. 8) One could have regarded as a vain title that
name of King of glory given to Jesus Christ; the Psalmist therefore supposes a
person who asks him this question: "Who is this King of glory?” It seems
that he is in astonishment and wants to learn if it is true, if it is worthy to
call Jesus Christ the King of glory. He is answered, "The Lord is strong
and mighty, he is the mighty Lord in battle," to teach him that it is not
in words alone, but in the testimony of the works that Jesus Christ is the King
of glory. It is indeed the strength and power that made him win an entire
victory over the devil and his followers, and which showed him the true king of
glory. The Psalmist repeats again: "Princes, raise up your doors, and you,
eternal doors, rise up,” (Ibid. 9) that is to say since the proofs of the power
of Christ, which you can not contradict without crime, teach you that he is
worthy of being called the King of glory, reject the error of your minds. He
adds, "And the King of glory will come in," to teach them that they
cannot participate in the faith of Jesus Christ until they have cleansed their
hearts from all the defilements of idolatry. The Holy Spirit cannot enter a man
unless he is completely renewed. "Who is this king of glory?” (Ibid. 10)
This repetition is intended to confirm the truth. All new teaching cannot be
well understood unless it is repeated, and what we hear for the first time
excites astonishment and surprise. "The Lord of the powers is himself this
king of glory.” By this repetition the Psalmist teaches us that the Lord of
powers is rightly called the King of glory, for what is more just than to give

To consider only the words, there is, it seems contradiction, but if we examine
the condition of man and animals, this contradiction disappears. God takes care
of all creatures, because it is from him that all hold their existence; but he
does not keep the animals for themselves. He keeps animals for men and not men
for animals. Thus he who cares for men preserves animals, but without them
being the object of that particular care which he reserves for men. For what

the holocausts that are offered to him; but that the groans and the pain of the
heart may satisfy for sin and obtain forgiveness. But God wanted the sacrament
to be the testimony of sin, and by the removal of the sacrifice the sinner
confessed publicly his sin. He tells us in another place how the forgiveness of
sins is obtained: "Share," he tells us, "by his prophet, your
bread with the hungry; when you see a naked man, cover him, and do not despise
those who have the same origin with you.” (Isa. 58) Or again: "God

confess our sin, and then teaches us the means to obtain our forgiveness.
Nowhere does he command to offer a sacrifice for a known sin; it is always for
the sins of ignorance, for man sins even without knowing it, and his intention
is faulty even when he believes he is acting according to the rules of justice.

This question has a lot of analogy with the previous one. A single expression
may have different meanings, as I have recalled above</font><sup><font size="2">1</font></sup><font size="3">. David's
enemies, who were seeking his ruin, rejoiced at his troubles. Thus they
approved of the sufferings and persecutions which David had to endure of Saul
and his son Absalom, and said loudly that there was nothing better. It is
absolutely as if someone who receives an outrage is said to have done well,
because it is to rejoice in the harm done to him, and to say, nothing more
just, he deserved it. The Savior uses the same expression in the joy of the
good works of Him whose merit He proclaims: "All right, good and faithful
servant." He testifies to his joy that the servant has gone from more and
more worthy, by saying to him, "Very well, you have done well to increase
the sum of your merits so that one and the same expression is employed in two
very different circumstances." This is what we ordinarily say of a man: he
is judged, it is what precedes or what follows which determines the meaning
which must be given to these words. They are taken sometimes in good, sometimes
in bad part, just as concupiscence is sometimes heard in a good sense,
sometimes in a bad sense.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">ON PSALM FIFTY. </span></span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—
This psalm is here placed not in chronological order, but for a particular
reason. The title, in fact, is determined by this reason and not by the rank of
this psalm. To consult only history, it is prior to the third, because David
was taken from his crime by the prophet Nathan before the rebellion of his son
Absalom, who wanted to take away both his kingdom and life. The reason why this
psalm is placed fiftieth, comes from the law which prescribed that the number
fifty was a remission number. This number is the one that comes first after
seven weeks and is the figure of the day of the Lord. In the same way, after
seven days the first day is the one that was made in the beginning, is always
the first to succeed the past week, so the fiftieth day that comes after seven
weeks is the first in a mysterious sense, and it is called twice the day of the
Lord, first of all because it was made in the beginning by the Lord, and when
returning to himself it is always the first after the periodic revolution of
each week; and second, because it is on this day that the Lord has risen after
triumphing over death; and for this reason it is also called the day of the Lord.
It is therefore rightly that forgiveness is attached to the number fifty that
we notice to be the first in a mysterious sense. The law was also given on the
fiftieth day. On the forty-eighth day after leaving Egypt, the children of
Israel are ordered to purify themselves for two days to prepare themselves to
receive the law on the third day. (Exod. 19:10) What does this purification
mean, if not the remission that is made on the fiftieth day that they receive
the law after being purified? All their past sins were obliterated, and now
they had to account for their actions according to the law they were given. It
was for the same reason, that the law had established, that purchased
possessions returned to their first owners in the fiftieth year. (Lev. 25:10)
This is why this psalm is placed on the fiftieth, for David implores the
forgiveness of his sins in the sense that we have said: "Have mercy on me,
O God! according to your great mercy." (Ps. 50:1) David knows the
seriousness of his crime and he asks for forgiveness in these terms: "Have
mercy on me, O God! according to your great mercy,” because the greatness of
mercy breaks out especially in the forgiveness of great faults. "And erase
my iniquity according to the multitude of your kindnesses.” To make him
understand the enormity of his sin, he calls it an iniquity, because iniquity
is not a slight sin, and he who erases iniquity, that is to say, that is to
say, who does not impute it has possessed in itself an abundant source of
mercy. He therefore has no excuse, and thereby not only softens the soul of his
judge, but inspires him with feelings of compassion. Pity naturally enters the
soul when a guilty man is seen to make a sincere confession of his sins, and to
express a deep pain. He who has no regret for his faults seems to mock his
judge, and he implores his forgiveness only to escape punishment and fall back
into the same faults. "Lift me more and more of my iniquity, and purify me
of my sin." (Ibid. 4) He has just proclaimed the great mercy of God, so he
asks him to purify him completely and not to leave in him the least stain, the
least stain of injustice that may offend his regards. And as a reason for his
prayer, he adds, "Because I know my iniquity, and I have my sin before my
eyes." (Ibid. 5) As he knows the extent of his he fears that he will not
be entirely forgiven for him. Consideration of the greatness of his sins throws
him into anxiety, because he knows that enormous sins are not easily forgiven. He
confesses his sin with tears; he always has it in front of his eyes to
completely bend his judge and make him favorable. He knows that it is written,
"First confess your iniquities to be fair to them." (Isa. 43:26)
"I have sinned before you alone, and I have done evil in your presence.” (Ps.
50:6) Here he considers the remedy of his error from another point of view, and
brings a new reason for his prayer, which, in the first place, justifies him
because another than God, is the enemy of the Creator God, since in his place
he establishes another to whom he attributes his authority, so David declares
that he is not guilty of this iniquity by saying, "I have sinned before
you alone, and I have done evil in your presence,” that is to say, as it is in
your presence that I have sinned, and not to another whom I should have
recognized as God by mistake, my fault is less great than the sin of those who
have devoted themselves to certain ruin.. I am not impious, but sinful, because
I have sinned not against you, but in your law, I have not denied you, but it
is in recognizing that you are my God and my Lord that I have sinned against a
man. Therefore, since I am not guilty of the crime that offends you personally,
forgive me for the sin I committed against one of my kind, for in preaching I
have not denied the honor due to your name for the transport to another. It was
therefore a motive to touch the heart of his judge. Since God exhorts to
convert the great number of those who sin against him, he must kindly welcome
those who have not sinned directly against him and who implore their
forgiveness on other grounds. Indeed, the Lord's will is that his servants
always have recourse to his protection. "So that you will be recognized as
righteous in your words, and you will remain victorious when judging your conduct.”
By imploring the mercy of God, he begs him not to change the decrees of his
justice which is not equal to the innocent and the sinners, that is to say, who
gives to each according to his works; but the holy prophet does not ignore the
nature of the mysterious prayer he addresses to God. He knows that God often
repeats in the law: "I am merciful, I, the Lord your God;” (Exod. 22:27)
He therefore prayed that this faith dwell in divine mercy, and God is justly
acknowledged in his words, faithful to what he has promised and not allowing
his mercy to be chained by the sins of men. Sinners also know the promises God
has made to the faithful observers of the law, and as they persevere in their
sins, they accuse God of falsehood. Their guilty life prevents them from
believing in the truth of God's promises. King David therefore asks God to
overcome this prejudice and to fulfill his promises, to cover with confusion
those who, without observing his commandments, accuse him of not giving what he
has promised. "For here I have been formed in iniquity." (Ps. 50:7)
Here he recalls the cause of the infidelity of the human race, the inclination
of man to sin to soften the judge's severity towards him. He wants to speak
here of the original fault of which Adam is guilty, and whose responsibility
has extended to all mankind. n conceiving iniquity to the deceitful persuasion
of the enemy, he has subjected all his posterity to the slavery of sin, and
none of his descendants can escape this slavery. That is why David adds,
"And my mother conceived me in sin,” that is to say, the sin of which Adam
is the source, extends to all those who are conceived and born to life, and
become for them an obstacle to the practice of good. David therefore hopes that
God will show mercy to him because he has a fierce enemy against him that
brings him to evil. By his sin the first man was enslaved to the devil, who
received the power to act upon his body and to seduce him with malicious
finesse the misleading attractions of sin which make him fall into the trap and
rob him of life. It is to the memory of this slavery that the doctor of the
nations exclaims: "I feel in my members another law which fights against
the law of my mind," (Rom. 7:23) so that at this sight, God, sensitive to
his complaints, extends his hand to him in the midst of the difficulties which
besiege him. "Because you loved the truth.” (Ps. 50:8) Since you have
loved the truth, he said to God, come to my aid, I beg you, for you know that I
have explained to you the true weaknesses of my soul, and you have resolved in
your mercy to save the sinner by healing by a heavenly providence the wounds
that sin has made to him on the earth. That's why he adds, "You have
revealed to me the secrets and mysteries of your heart.” These secrets and
these mysteries are the help that God has prepared for the human race, of which
the Apostle said: "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of
man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him,"1 Cor. 2:9) Who
are those who love God? those who accept his law without trying to disguise or
excuse their faults. These secrets of the heart are thus revealed to those who
love God. The multitude of sins with which they deplore the sad influence could
have made them question the justice of punishment, reject their faults on their
origin, and make God their creator responsible for their sins. Their hearts
were enlightened with a spiritual light and they discovered the providence of
God in the coming of Christ who was to come to destroy the sin that had
exercised the tyranny on mankind since the evasiveness of Adam. King David
therefore asks God that, since he has resolved to save the human race one day
from the sad state in which he sees him reduced, he anticipates for himself,
the victim of the same misfortune, the salvation he must give to all one day, and
that he should give to his prayers and tears the free gift which he held in
reserve and which he could not grant before the marked time. How will it be
done? He indicates it with the following words: "You will water me with
the hyssop and I will be purified.” (Ps. 50:9) He rightly asks to be purified
by sprinkling with the hyssop. The children of Israel sprinkled the poles of
their house with this sprinkling to escape the exterminating angel (Exod.
20:22), and David also asks to be purified of his sins by the sprinkling of the
hyssop, also to escape from death. "You will wash me and I will become
whiter than the snow." Now it is evident that God's action is at a great
distance from the action of man, which is why David says, "And I will be
whiter than snow,” because the work of God has a character of perfection which
the work of man cannot have. It therefore requires to be purified by sprinkling
with hyssop, that is, just as the body is purified by water from its material
soils, so the hyssop is the purified figure of a spiritual operation of the
souls by the defilements of sin. Sprinkling with the hyssop is a kind of
purification whose visible action indicates the inner and invisible purification.
"You will make me hear words of comfort and joy." (Ps. 50:10) There
is no doubt that the voice of one who announces the remission of sins does not
spread joy in the souls of sinners. Who would not rejoice, indeed, at the news
of the forgiveness granted to him? For the forgiveness of God gives all
security for the present and for the future. So David adds, "And the
humbled bones shall tremble with gladness." David's humiliation was of two
kinds, he was humbled in his sin, for sin is no one's cause of elevation, and
he humbled himself to implore his forgiveness, and begged God under the ashes
and the sackcloth to show mercy to him, and the pardon bestowed upon him,
brought joy to his soul and strength to his dejected body. "Turn aside
your eyes from my crimes, and give me all my iniquities." (Ibid. 11) David
asks God to forgive him as he should later grant by faith in Jesus Christ, and
that the Savior who He has been spiritually promised by him to forgive sins
with truly repentant hearts. The one in whom one no longer looks at sins and
whose iniquities are erased has no longer to fear being treated as guilty, and
his enemies are reduced to silence. He who does not look at sins does not
impute them either; to look away from the faults of a sinner is to refuse to
receive an accusation against him. But how is David, accused only of two
crimes, accusing himself of many other iniquities? Since Nathan had assured him
that God had forgiven him, why does he beg forgiveness with so much solicitude?
He did not plead only his cause, but in this confession of his sin he
understood all the spiritual miseries of his people. He therefore asks for a
complete renewal, for he who gets his pardon is not without confusion if he is
not restored to his first state and in a rank which excludes all shame, and he
announces for all the others the grace of God who was to purify all their sins.
"Create in me, O God, a pure heart, and reestablish a righteous spirit in
the depths of my womb.” (Ibid. 12) This is to implore the mercy of God in
excellent dispositions. David does not confine himself to asking for the
forgiveness of the past, his solicitude extends to the future, he is resolved
to hate sin to no longer fall back, and he prays to God to fortify him with the
spirit of justice that he will re-establish in his soul, that is to say, give
him a new spirit which keeps him from all sin and all that is contrary to his
well-known will. Now, one has a pure heart when one keeps oneself away from all
internal and external sin, from action and thought. It is almost impossible to
observe this purity of heart in all its extent, but at least it must be in the
essential relationship of the soul with God and keep his pure heart in the
mystery of God and Jesus Christ by inviolably preserving the faith we have in
them. Indeed, we read in another place of Scripture, "Who can be glorified
to have a pure heart or to be free from sin?" (Prov. 20:9) But David kept
his heart pure in his dealings with God, because he never claimed the help of
vanity, that is to say idolatry, and that he never did what the Lord had
commanded him. He adds for the future: "Do not reject me from your face,
and do not remove from me your Holy Spirit.” (Ps. 50:13) He again expresses the
thought that we have indicated above, he is sure of his forgiveness, but he is
concerned with the entire reform of his soul. The servant to whom we are
content to forgive remains far from the presence of his mistress. There is no
rage against him, yet his crime is not effaced in the mind of his master or
judge. David therefore prayed that his sin be entirely obliterated and that he
be made worthy to approach the face of the Lord and to prophesy as in the past,
which was granted him. This is what he asks with these words: "And do not
remove from me your Holy Spirit," that is, the spirit of prophecy.
"Give me the joy of your salvation, and support me with the sovereign
Spirit.” (Ibid. 14) He asks God for the joy that was promised in the coming of
Christ, so that, cleansed and purified of all his tasks, he would be filled
with the joy that would come from the salvation he had and, far from losing his
crown, he was confirmed on the throne by the Holy Spirit. He calls it the
Sovereign Spirit because he is above all creatures and it is through him that
kings rule. "I will teach your ways to the wicked, and the wicked will be
converted to you.” (Ibid. 15) He thus expresses himself so that the wicked may
learn by his example what is the goodness of God who welcomes sinners as soon
as they confess their faults and who does not abandon the impious who have
converted to him, but never cease to exhort them by showing mercy to others.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">"Deliver me, God of my salvation, of all
the blood I shed.”</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">(Ibid. 16) David shows here that his
sin was worthy of death to proclaim the greatness of God's mercy to him and to
excite sinners to take refuge, as he did, in the bosom of God's clemency. <span> </span></font><font size="3">"And my tongue will celebrate your
righteousness with hymns of joy. He declares his joy in the justice of the Lord
because he perseveres in him the effect of this promise of God: "I will
not take away from them my mercy." (Ps. 88:34) David, full of joy and
security on this point, celebrates the righteousness of his God: "You
shall open my lips, and my mouth shall proclaim your praise." (Ps. 50:17)
God opens his lips by delivering him from slavery. The mouth of the deliverer
is opened, but the mouth of the sinner remains closed, shame and fear condemn
him to silence, while the one who has regained his full freedom breaks out his
transports and publishes the praises of his judge. Thus the Apostle, free from
all servitude, as he testifies, exclaims: "My mouth opens to you, O
Corinthians.” (2 Cor. 6:11) "If you had desired a sacrifice, I would have
offered it to you." (Ps. 50:18) David speaks here of certain knowledge; he
remembered what the holy prophet Samuel had said to King Saul, who believed
that he could erase his sin not by the pain of his soul or by the shedding of
his tears, but by offering a sacrifice.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">"Does
the Lord want sacrifices, and do not ask for obeying his voice?” (1 Sam. 15:22)
because these sacrifices can be harmful and do not appease the righteousness of
God. The only thing that soothes him is a soul who, at the memory of his sin,
weeps in the bitterness and tribulation of the heart the misfortune of
offending God. "But with burnt offerings you will not be delighted.” (Ps.
50:19) No, God is not pleased with the holocaust, but with the feelings we have
just spoken of. It's up to the soul to satisfy him, without looking outside for
anything to pay him ransom. That's what can really help him a lot. Just as the
soul has yielded to the seductive charms of sin, it must submit to the pain of
penance, and then God will take pleasure in erasing his sins. "For the
sacrifice worthy of God is a broken spirit of pain. God does not despise a
suppressed and humiliated heart." (Ibid. 19) David tells us here what a
sacrifice God receives for sins; it is impossible to appease him unless he who
has rejoiced at the loss of his soul opens his heart to pain and repentance and
thus finds life again. Any turbulent and unrestrained man is often exposed to
receiving wounds that cannot be cured without pain; In the same way sinners
cannot redeem their sins without the guilty soul being penetrated with a deep
sense of pain., for it is to all righteousness that he who has tasted the joy
which reason disapproves be subject to the pain which reason commands,
"Lord, treat favorably Sion and make them feel the effects of your
goodness." (Ibid. 20) Zion is the figure of the Church, and according to
our feeling, which will not seem unlikely, David suggests that she ask God to
fulfill his promise, because he knows that she will receive the complete
remission of her sins when God has fully fulfilled His decrees through Jesus
Christ, that is, those who hope in the salvation promised to them will be
delivered from all sin; and indeed they will be delivered by Jesus Christ not
only from their own sins, but from the sin of Adam, of which all his
descendants are born guilty. "And the walls of Jerusalem will be high.”
Had they been destroyed? The walls of Jerusalem are here the figure of the
Church which was to be raised by the law in Jesus Christ. Its walls are the
saints, as we learn from the Apocalypse of St. John, where we see that we must
understand by the city of Jerusalem and by its walls the servants of God. (Rev.
21:12) King David knew that it was Christ who was to fulfill the promise of the
deliverance of the servants of God; he therefore asks God to fulfill it, that is
to say, the Church rises on the foundation of faith, and those who hope for
their salvation by this faith are delivered from the slavery of sin. "Then
you will agree to a sacrifice of righteousness, oblations and burnt offerings.”
(Ps. 50:21) David declares here that God would be blessed with oblations and
burnt offerings when the Church was built, and not sacrifices offered without
rule or at the pleasure of everyone, but: "You will agree to the sacrifice
of justice.” Sacrifice is right when you take from God a worthy victim of his;
but there is no sacrifice neither more just, nor more worthy than the offering
we make to God of ourselves. “God is spirit.” (Jn. 4:24), so we must offer him
spiritual sacrifices, that is, to offer the living God a living victim. David
had declared that God was not in favor of the expiation of sins, the carnal
sacrifices; He teaches, therefore, that spiritual sacrifices should be offered
to him, and that he would be agreeable to them, because these sacrifices are
worthy of God; that is to say, sacrifices were of little value in the past,
because they were all exterior, and they are now of great value, because they
are spiritual. "Then will we put calves on your altar to offer them to
you?" He has just announced that the ancient sacrifices would succeed
spiritual sacrifices; what do these words mean: "Then will we put calves

the figure of the spiritual victims, since he has declared that God has no carnal
sacraments for pleasing. These calves are here as a figure of the new people to
whom faith in Jesus Christ gave a new birth and whose piety is sacrificed every
day on the altar of the Lord. Since David has spoken clearly about the Church
here, the sacrifices that are placed therein are necessarily spiritual
sacrifices.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

HAS EATEN THE BREAD OF ANGELS," SINCE ANGELS, CREATURES SIMPLE IN THEIR
NATURE AND CLOTHED WITH A VERY SPIRITUAL POWER, DO NOT NEED FOOD?</span></span><span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"> </span></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">—</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> This bread, which the Psalmist
calls the bread of angels, is nothing but manna. Now, the word manna means:
What is this? For the sons of Israel, when they saw on the earth a kind of
white seed of coriander, said one to another, What is this? in Hebrew MAN HU.
(Exod. 16:15) This bread or food was not created by virtue of the laws that
govern the world, by the blending of certain elements, it descended from heaven
by an effect of a divine providence. It did not even exist in the upper regions
of the air, it was created at the moment by the power of God to nourish the
bodies. It was given the name of angels' bread because it was created by that
same power that gave the angels existence and life; for no life is apart from
God. It is because it descended from heaven that manna was called the bread of
angels. The Psalmist has expressed himself in this way to recall the greatness
and excellence of the blessings of God upon men, that at this sight they may
give thanks to God, who governs his servants with so much kindness, that he
gives, if it is necessary to them, the very food of the angels. The Apostle
says, among other things, "Christ was the stone," (1 Cor. 10:4), that
is, Christ was called the stone, because it is his power that made pouring
gushes of water from the stone. (Exod. 17:6) In the same way, as it is by an
effect of its power that the manna is descended from heaven, it receives the
name of manna, that is, of bread; this symbolic food is the figure of what is
now offered in the Church, and men, that is, the Jews, have eaten the bread of
the Christian people shown in Scripture by the angels. Let us add that grace is
now more abundant than it was under the prophets, as well as the liberty given
by Jesus Christ, for where the spirit of the Lord is, is freedom. (2 Cor. 3:17)
This is why, considering the times and the bonding of graces, the name of
angels was given to the Christians, whose bread, which is Jesus Christ, was
eaten by the Jews, who are here called men; for Jesus Christ belongs rather to
those to whom he has been revealed and who have the honor of bearing this name.
This question can therefore be understood in two different senses, and the
manna may be called or the bread of the angels of heaven, or the bread of the
Christians, according to the explanation we have given.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

All truth is at the same time justice. By confessing what he is, the man is
right because he is telling the truth. Sinners, on the contrary, who do honor
to their faults, cannot be justified. This man who accuses himself therefore
deserves the name of righteous, because in confessing his sin, he asks for its
forgiveness and implores the mercy of God, because he knows that it is written
in the law: "Confess your sins for to be justified." (Isa. 43:26) But
to make this admission at the beginning of one's speech is to do it without
being forced to do so. For whoever lives even in the fear of God can be without
sin, since he mixes with our thoughts, and we sometimes sin as in spite of ourselves?
One can, however, hear these words of the catechumen who embraces faith to be
justified. Since he asks to be changed, he certainly confesses his sins to be

"THE RICH AND THE POOR HAVE COME TOGETHER, THE LORD IS THE CREATOR OF

PERSONS? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— Far
from the spirit of the faithful, such an impious assertion. Scripture, so as
not to appear to teach to despise the poor and to honor the rich, reminds us
that God is the creator of both, not as rich or poor, but as that they are men.
For if their fortune is different, their nature is the same; and if the
opportunities which arise in life have the result of giving to some the
prosperity which follows the riches, or the hardships which accompany poverty,
it is not a reason to despise those whom God has not humiliated, or to honor
those to whom the truth has not borne witness. Those who are unquestionably
worthy of contempt are the public corrupters of morals and the sacrilegious
violators of the law of God, just as we must honor those who love God and keep
his law faithfully. The truly rich men in the eyes of God are those whose lives
are pure, and the more they look despicable in the world, the more they are
worthy of honor in heaven. Those whom the favors of the present life have made
possessors of immense wealth, if they know each other well and understand the
will of God who gave the earth to all men, which raises his sun for all and
spreads indiscriminately on all the dew of heaven (Matt 5:45), seeing that the
injustice of the times, or an unforeseen misfortune, or the indigence deny some
what God has given to all, will tell them of what they possess, and thus
fulfilling the will of God, they will be rich not only on earth, but in heaven,
and these transient riches will not exclude them from the possession of eternal
riches. As for those whom poverty seems worthy of contempt, if they meditate on
the future judgment of God, they will see that they will be eternally rich,
where the rich of the age will be reduced to extreme indigence, and will repent
of having not been poor on earth.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

things come from God; as for the evils of doubt it is here a question, they are
only such as when they serve to chastise us. This is how God speaks to the

you. Now, life and death are represented to us as coming from God, because he
has given the law that promises life to those who observe it, and threatens
those who transgress it from death, which is called the second death. As it is
God who gives back to everyone what he deserves, it is from him that come the
sentence of life or the condemnation to death. God is not the author of death,
but the judge; the author of death is sin. How, then, could God have made
death, who knows no sin? It is because it gives to sins what is due to them,
that Scripture says that death comes from him, although it does not come in
reality, but from him who has sinned; it is in the same sense that poverty and
wealth come from God, there are some who, under the impression of the fear of
God, despise the pleasures of the senses, flee the lavishness of life, do not
turn away the eyes of the poor and the needy, and thus accumulate real
treasures, because it is written in Proverbs: "The love of the rule makes
misery and genealogy disappear. (Prov. 13:18) But those who have no fear of
God, who live without rule and without restraint, and despise the poor, will be
in want, as it is written: “They have been full,” not only of negligence and
improvidence for their interests, but of contempt for the law which was given
to them. It is in this sense that God made the poor and the rich; as the
transgression of the law produces poverty, we attribute this effect to God, the
author of the law, and when others, for fear of His judgments, are faithful to
the prescriptions of the law, we also say that it is God, author of the law,
who enriches them.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"GOD CREATED THE WORLD OF INVISIBLE MATTER,” AND THESE VERY CONTRARY WORDS

God simultaneously created all the elements of the world in a chaotic and
confused state, in which the darkness was mingled. These confused elements,
air, fire, water, earth, darkness, are what Scripture calls an invisible
matter, as we read in Genesis; "The earth was invisible and
unformed." (Gen. 1) So it is from these confused elements that God created
the world by establishing the faith, so that the waters coming together, the
earth could offer the human race. This distinction and this separation of
elements is a dwelling place for man under the spherical space which covers the
earth.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

47. </span></b></span><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">BY WHAT MEANS DO THESE WORDS OF
ISAIAH: "SEVEN WOMEN WILL TAKE, ETC.," SHOULD THEY BE UNDERSTOOD AS
THE SEVEN CATHOLIC CHURCHES?</span></span></font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">
</font><a name="_Hlk514918409"><font color="#000000" size="3">— </font></a><font size="3">"In that day,” said. the Prophet, “seven
women will approach a single man and say to him: We will eat our bread, we will
provide ourselves with our clothes; that your name alone be invoked against us,
deliver us from the reproach upon us." It is a generally accepted truth
that these seven women are the seven churches (Rev. 2-3); for although the
Church is one, or represents it as having seven different forms, just as one
body is composed of seven different members. Indeed, we are not the only
members of the Church of which Jesus Christ is the head (Eph. 5:23); the
inhabitants of heaven are part of it. Let us therefore speak of only one
church, whether we represent seven different churches, there is no
contradiction. The Church is one because she has only one leader who is Jesus
Christ; and we can say that there are seven churches, because just as the
members are different, so the spiritual powers among which we take our place,
are different virtues which are called for that the powers of the airs. Now,
they are different so that they do not all have the same power, but that they
all contribute to forming the body of Jesus Christ; for he is the head of the
body of the Church, and it is to him that the whole body owes its existence,
that is to say, it is from him that everything, whether in heaven, or on the
earth, originates. Now, speaking of the Church of the earth, the sacred writer
mentions all the churches, because the mysteries of the Creator, which are
taught in the Church of the earth, are at the same time announced to the
heavenly spirits. When the inferiors are educated, those who are above must
necessarily participate in this teaching. This is what makes the Apostle say:
"I, the youngest among the saints, have received the grace of announcing
to the Gentiles the incomprehensible riches of Jesus Christ, and of
enlightening all men on the economy of the mystery which had been hidden for
centuries in God, the creator of all things, so that the principalities and the
celestial powers knew by the Church the wisdom of God, so different in its
operations." (Eph. 3:8-10) So it is the Church of the earth who instructed
the heavenly powers, because the truth has come out of the bosom of the earth.
It is therefore to mention the heavenly powers that the seven Churches are here
named as forming only one people, and the prophet represents them addressing
their supplications to the Savior made man. They understood that Jesus Christ
was born to erase the contempt first of those who lived under the law, and then
of all other peoples. They recollected this prophecy: "There shall come
from Zion a Redeemer who will deliver Jacob and remove from him all
ungodliness."</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">(Isa. 59:20) These
seven churches then approached one man, that is, from Jesus Christ at his birth,
and said to him, "We will eat our bread, we will provide ourselves for our
clothes; that your name alone be invoked against us, deliver us from the
reproach upon us.” What is the object of their prayer? If they eat their bread,
if they provide for their clothes, that is to say, if they have food and
clothing, what are they lacking? The bread is the emblem of life, and the garment
signifies the action of putting on God, because the one who is without God is
in a real state of nakedness. That is why the Apostle says: "All of you
who you have been baptized into Jesus Christ, you have been clothed in Jesus
Christ." (Gal. 3:27) And in another place: "If, however, we are found
dressed and not naked.” (2 Cor. 5:3) But what is this contempt that these women
ask to be delivered? These seven churches represent the people who lived under
the law in expectation of the promised Christ who was to erase their sins. They
say to him, "We will eat our bread," that is to say, the words of the
law which teach the existence of one God shall be our food; because man does
not live only with bread, but with every word that comes out of the mouth of
God." (Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4) “And we will wear our clothes,” that is to
say, we will bear the name of our Creator, for each one is as clothed in the
profession of his faith. It is to their clothes that the representatives and
the magistrates are known. But it was not enough to be worthy of God; he has
therefore established that it is through the knowledge of one God that man
would become heir to the kingdom of heaven. The law purges him of his sins,
delivers him from the second death which, according to the sentence pronounced
against Adam, kept the men in the underworld, and thus free of all ties he goes
to the paradise of God the Father, where the Lord promised at the right time
that he would be with him. (Luke 23:43) Although the people of whom we have
just spoken, and whose seven churches are the figure under the law of God, he
was guilty of both his own sins and the sin of his first father;
"For," says St. Paul, "all have sinned and fall short of the
glory of God.” (Rom. 3:23) These churches therefore ask God to deliver them
from their reproach by the invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, because
those who bear the sign by which he has conquered the dead, cannot be held
under the power of his enemy. And it is not only these churches of the earth,
but the spiritual powers who dwell in heaven, who ask that the name of Jesus
Christ be invoked upon them. For all spiritual and celestial they are, these
powers do not fail to be subject to contempt if they remain distant from their
Creator, and failing to know their leader they go astray and cannot be members
of his body. The prophet himself confirms the truth of the explanation we have
just given, adding, "In that day the Lord will shine on the earth the
light of His counsels," (Isa. 4:2, according to the LXX) and a little
further on: "The Lord will wash the filth of the sons and daughters of
Zion, and cleanse them of the blood that is in their midst." Is it not
evident that in this day that is to say, on this day when the promises of God
will be fulfilled, and the mysteries of faith revealed to men, those who were
subject to the death sentence have been enlightened, purified by the knowledge
of their Creator, and became heirs of eternal life! The prophet, therefore,
spoke generally here to signify that all needed the grace of God, and to
establish that all just or sinners had to wait for His mercy: sinners, to be
cleansed of their personal sins and delivered from death; the righteous, to be
free from the sin of their first father, and from the sentence pronounced against
Adam, who held all men under the bondage of death, and to recover freedom and
their rights to the kingdom of God, from which they are no longer servants but
children.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  DID THE DEATH SENT AGAINST JACOB FALL ON ISRAEL, SINCE JACOB IS ALSO CALLED
  BY THE NAME OF ISRAEL? </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">—
  The prophet here uses two names designating the same people to mark the
  distinction of merits by the naming of names. For he who received the name of
  Israel was called Jacob first. In struggling against the Savior, he
  understood that it was God whom he saw in human form (Gen. 32:28), and it was
  after this vision that he was called the man who sees God. The people to whom
  the prophet gives the name of Jacob here represent the carnal people, like
  the names that parents give to their children. But the name of the Israelites
  was never given to this people, that is, to the Jews, whom their criminal
  conduct made unworthy, because they sacrificed to animals and forests during
  the reign and rule of King Jeroboam. The people, on the contrary, who offered
  to Jerusalem, in the temple of the Lord, victims by the ministry of the
  priests, was called Israel. The kingdom of Samaria was therefore delivered to
  captivity and death as a punishment for his ungodliness; Jerusalem was
  protected for some time, thanks to the piety and zeal of its kings for the
  worship of the true God. But as soon as Jerusalem followed the impiety of
  Samaria, she was enveloped in her condemnation. That is why the prophet begins
  by saying, "God sent death against Jacob," that is, against the
  people of Samaria, whose life was carnal, as we have seen above, and
  "Death fell upon Israel,” that is, upon the people of Jerusalem, because
  they followed the people of Samaria in the ways of idolatry and were taken
  captive by Nebuchadnezzar, as the people of Samaria had been led away by
  Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians. In clearer terms, the sentence pronounced
  against the wicked extended to the good, because they had ceased to walk in
  the ways of justice. Indeed, the death sent against Jacob fell on Israel, as
  we have shown, but without failing to strike Samaria. The cause that sent her
  against Samaria came to Jerusalem, and was sent there to punish the same
  crimes as in Samaria. For divine vengeance pursues crime without distinction
  of persons. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  DID THE DEATH SENT AGAINST JACOB FALL ON ISRAEL, SINCE JACOB IS NONE OTHER
  THAN ISRAEL? </font></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">—<span>  </span></font><font size="3">The prophet here uses two names designating
  the same people. He who was first called Jacob then received the name of
  Israel after his struggle with the Son of God, and when seeing him in his
  spirit he was like a man who saw God. The people to whom he gives the name of
  Jacob here designate the people who do not see God, the carnal people,
  because of their evil deeds. Just as the patriarch Jacob, before seeing the
  Christ God, was not called Israel, this people who bears the name of Jacob
  designate those who do not see God. Israel, on the contrary, represents the
  part of the people which his holy works have made worthy of seeing God. Now
  the people of Jacob, who, given over to the worship of idols, leaned on an
  arm of flesh instead of putting their confidence in the help of God, was
  delivered to death when God had to march against him the king of the
  Assyrians. For the words of the prophet must be understood by the people of
  Samaria, who first wronged God by establishing calves for whom he sacrificed
  by the ministry of the new priests whom Jeroboam had instituted. Death was sent
  against this people; for he was first captured and brought into captivity by
  Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, to serve as an example to the people of
  Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, the two and a half tribes who remained, and who,
  under Rehoboam, son of Solomon, offered sacrifices in the temple by the
  ministry of the priests of the Lord. The prophet calls them the people of
  Israel because of the tribe of Judah and Levi, whom the people of Samaria
  should have frightened and brought to goodness, and who also gave themselves
  up to the evil and the shameful worship of the idols of the people. Yet there
  were some kings in Jerusalem who, despite the guilty examples given by
  Solomon and his son Rehoboam, followed David's footsteps and walked in the
  right way in the presence of the Lord. All the kings of Samaria, on the
  contrary, proved evil in the eyes of God until the time of their captivity.
  From there the carnal name that was given to them. Jerusalem having imitated
  their ungodliness, her people were themselves taken into captivity by
  Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; so these words are explained: "Death
  was sent against Jacob, and it fell on Israel." It was sent first
  against Samaria, but the cause that sent it happened in Jerusalem, so he was
  sent there to chastise the same crimes as in Samaria; for the vengeance of
  God is not attached to the place, but to the crime it seeks to punish.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  Jerusalem who have apostatized the worship of God cannot be invited by the
  prophet to rejoice, but rather to groan and cry. It is therefore in
  comparison with the reproach of this Jerusalem that the prophet invites to
  joy the heavenly Jerusalem which the Apostle calls our mother (Gal. 4:20), because
  without groans and pain she has more children than the one that causes tears
  in the children of the flesh, that is to say, the Jews. The heavenly
  Jerusalem generates spiritual children by faith. The prophet calls her an
  abandoned wife because she is the life that Adam first abandoned to follow
  the path of death. When men are regenerated, they return to the life they had
  abandoned. This life is Jesus Christ who said of himself, "I am
  life." (Jn. 14:16) God the Father is also life, as our Lord teaches in
  another place: "For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given
  to the Son to have life in himself.” (Jn. 5:26) There is no doubt that the
  Holy Spirit is also life, according to this testimony of the Savior: He will
  receive from what is mine. (Jn. 16:15) He who receives from life is himself
  life. The three persons are therefore one life, it is by faith in this life
  that we are regenerated, it is our mother, as we read in Genesis, because
  this life is the mother of all the living. (Gen. 3:20) Now, who are these
  living except those who believe? </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

  PREGNANT, SING HYMNS OF PRAISE, SHOUT FOR JOY, YOU WHO HAD NO CHILDREN, THE
  ABANDONED WIFE HAS BECOME MORE FERTILE THAN THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND." </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">— It must be understood here that
  there are two mothers, one celestial, the other terrestrial, that is to say
  the free Jerusalem.</span></font><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It
  is therefore in comparison with the shame of this Jerusalem that the prophet
  invites to rejoice in the heavenly Jerusalem which the Apostle calls our
  mother. (Gal. 4:25) The prophet announcing the coming of the Lord and
  proclaiming with triumphant voice the time when grace is to be poured out
  abundantly, exhorts to rejoice the heavenly Jerusalem which he says he was
  abandoned, because it was not around her children begotten by faith. The time
  had come when she must have the children who were predicted of her, and in
  far greater numbers than the children of the earthly Jerusalem, for the
  number of Christians far surpassed that of the Jews. She is also called
  sterile because she is a virgin and she begets her children spiritually by
  faith and without the flesh having any part in it. Also the prophet does not
  say that she gives birth, because the birth is always accompanied by their
  gift. She, on the contrary, utters cries of joy when she sees the salvation
  of the human race. The earthly Jerusalem has a husband, because it breeds
  children according to the flesh. The city is here assimilated to a mother,
  just as the heavenly habitation destined for us is called our mother.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

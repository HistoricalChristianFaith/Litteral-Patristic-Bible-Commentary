<p>1. Great and admirable is the dignity of an Apostle, and we find <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> constantly setting forth the causes of it, not as if he took the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to himself, but as entrusted with it, and being under the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of so doing. For when he speaks of himself as <q>called,</q> and that <q>by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and again elsewhere, <q>a necessity is laid upon me</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co009.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 9:16</font></u></a></span>, and when he says, <q>for this I was separated,</q> by these expressions all idea of arrogance and ambition is removed. For as he deserves the severest blame, who intrudes into an office which is not given him of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, so he who refuses, and shrinks from it when offered to him, incurs blame of another kind, that of rebellion and disobedience. Therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, in the beginning of this Epistle, thus expresses himself, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, an Apostle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> by the commandment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> He does not say here, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> called,</q> but <q>by commandment.</q> He begins in this manner, that Timothy may not feel any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> infirmity from supposing that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> addresses him on the same terms as his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. But where is this commandment given? We read in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>The Spirit said, Separate me <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02300a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Barnabas</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:2</font></u></a></span> And everywhere in his writings <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> adds the name of Apostle, to instruct his hearers not to consider the doctrines he delivered as proceeding from man. For an Apostle can say nothing of his own, and by calling himself an Apostle, he at once refers his hearers to Him that sent him. In all his Epistles therefore he begins by assuming this title, thus giving authority to his words, as here he says, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, an Apostle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> according to the commandment of God our Saviour.</q> Now it does not appear that the Father anywhere commanded him. It is everywhere Christ who addresses him. Thus, <q>He said unto me, Depart, for I will send you far hence unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act022.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 22:21</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>You must be brought before Cæsar.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act027.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 27:24</font></u></a></span> But whatever the Son commands, this he considers to be the commandment of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, as those of the Spirit are the commandments of the Son. For he was sent by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, he was separated by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, and this he says was the commandment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. What then? Does it derogate from the power of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, that His Apostle was sent forth by the commandment of the Father? By no means. For observe, how he represents the power as common to both. For having said, <q>according to the commandment of God our Saviour</q>; he adds, <q>and Lord <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, our hope.</q> And observe, with what propriety he applies the titles. And indeed, the Psalmist applies this to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, saying, <q>The hope of all the ends of the earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa063.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 64:5</font></u></a></span> And again, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a> in another place writes, <q>For therefore we both labor, and suffer reproach, because we have hope in the living God.</q> The teacher must suffer dangers even more than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. For I will smite the shepherd, (he says,) <q>and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/zec013.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Zechariah 13:7</font></u></a></span> Therefore the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> rages with greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> against teachers, because by their destruction the flock also is scattered. For by slaying the sheep, he has lessened the flock, but when he has made away with the shepherd, he has ruined the whole flock, so that he the rather assaults him, as working greater mischief by a less effort; and in one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> effecting the ruin of all. For this reason <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, at the beginning, elevates and encourages the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of Timothy, by saying, We have God for our Saviour and Christ for our hope. We suffer much, but our hopes are great; we are exposed to snares and perils, but to save us we have not man but God. Our Saviour is not weak, for He is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and whatever be our dangers they will not overcome us; nor is our hope made ashamed, for it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. For in two ways we are enabled to bear up against dangers, when we are either speedily delivered from them, or supposed by good hopes under them.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> never calls himself the Apostle of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, but always of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Because he makes everything common to both. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> itself he calls <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> And whatever we suffer here, he implies, things present are as nothing.</p>
<p><q>Unto Timothy, my own son in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>This too is encouraging. For if he evinced such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> as to be called peculiarly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> <q>own</q> son, he might be confident also with respect to the future. For it is the part of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> not to be cast down or disturbed, though circumstances occur that seem contrary to the promises. But observe he says, <q>my son,</q> and even <q>my own son,</q> and yet he is not of the same substance. But what? Was he of irrational kind? <q>Well,</q> says one, <q>he was not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, so this does not imply 'being of' another.</q> What then? Was he of another substance? Neither was it so, for after saying <q>my own son,</q> he adds, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>,</q> to show that he was really <q>his own son,</q> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> from him. There was no difference. The likeness he bore to him was in respect to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, as in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> births there is a likeness in respect of substance. The son is like the father in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> beings, but with respect to God the proximity is greater. For here a father and a son, though of the same substance, differ in many particulars, as in color, figure, understanding, age, bent of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, endowments of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and body, and in many other things they may be like or unlike, but there is no such dissimilarity in the divine Essence. <q>By commandment.</q> This is a stronger expression than <q>called</q>, as we learn from other passages. As he here calls Timothy <q>my own son,</q> in like manner he says to the Corinthians, <q>in Christ Jesus I have begotten you,</q> i.e. in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; but he adds the word <q>own,</q> to show his particular likeness to himself, as well as his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> and great affection for him. Notice again the <q>in</q> applied to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. <q>My own son,</q> he says, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> See what an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> distinction, in that he calls him not only his <q>son,</q> but his <q>own</q> son.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2</font></u></a>. <q>Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> our Lord.</q></p>
<p>Why is mercy mentioned here, and not in the other Epistles? This is a further mark of his affection. Upon his son he invokes greater blessings, with the anxious apprehension of a parent. For such was his anxiety, that he gives directions to Timothy, which he has done in no other case, to attend to his bodily health; where he says, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:23</font></u></a></span> Teachers indeed stand more in need of mercy.</p>
<p><q>From God our Father,</q> he says, <q>and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> our Lord.</q></p>
<p>Here too is consolation. For if God is our Father, He cares for us as sons, as Christ says, <q>What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:9</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 3</font></u></a>. <q>As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia.</q></p>
<p>Observe the gentleness of the expression, more like that of a servant than of a master. For he does not say <q>I commanded,</q> or <q>bade</q> or even <q>exhorted,</q> but <q>I besought you.</q> But this tone is not for all: only meek and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> are to be treated thus. The corrupt and insincere are to be dealt with in a different manner, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself elsewhere directs, <q>Rebuke them with all authority</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 2:15</font></u></a></span>; and here he says <q>charge,</q> not <q>beseech,</q> but <q>charge some that they teach no other doctrine.</q> What means this? That <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> Epistle which he sent them was not sufficient? Nay, it was sufficient; but men are apt sometimes to slight Epistles, or perhaps this may have been before the Epistles were written. He had himself passed some time in that city. There was the temple of Diana, and there he had been exposed to those great sufferings. For after the assembly in the Theater had been dissolved, and he had called to him and exhorted the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, he found it necessary to sail away, though afterwards he returned to them. It were worth enquiry, whether he stationed Timothy there at that time. For he says, that <q>you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine</q>: he does not mention the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> by name, that he might not, by the openness of his rebuke, render them more shameless. There were in that city certain false Apostles of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, who wished to oblige the faithful to observe the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10582c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jewish law</font></u></a>, a fault he is everywhere noticing in his Epistles; and this they did not from motives of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, so much as from vainglory, and a wish to have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, from jealousy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>, and a spirit of opposition to him. This is meant by <q>teaching another doctrine.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 4</font></u></a>. <q>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.</q></p>
<p>By <q>fables</q> he does not mean the law; far from it; but inventions and forgeries and counterfeit doctrines. For, it seems, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> wasted their whole discourse on these unprofitable points. They numbered up their fathers and grandfathers, that they might have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a> of historical <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> and research. <q>That you might charge some,</q> he says, <q>that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.</q> Why does he call them <q>endless</q>? It is because they had no end, or none of any use, or none easy for us to apprehend. Mark how he disapproves of questioning. For where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> exists, there is no need of question. Where there is no room for curiosity, questions are superfluous. Questioning is the subversion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. For he that seeks has not yet found. He who questions cannot <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. Therefore it is his advice that we should not be occupied with questions, since if we question, it is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> sets reasoning at rest. But why then does Christ say, <q>Seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:7</font></u></a></span>; and, <q>Search the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, for in them you think you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse39" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:39</font></u></a></span> The seeking there is meant of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> and vehement desire, and He bids <q>search the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>,</q> not to introduce the labors of questioning, but to end them, that we may ascertain and settle their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> meaning, not that we may be ever questioning, but that we may have done with it. And he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> said, <q>Charge some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables, and endless genealogies, which minister questions rather than the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> Justly has he said, <q>the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> For great are the blessings which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is willing to dispense; but the greatness of them is not conceived by reasoning. This must then be the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, which is the best medicine of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. This questioning therefore is opposed to the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For what is dispensed by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>? To receive His mercies and become better men; to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> and dispute of nothing; but to repose in confidence. For what <q>ministers questions</q> displaces <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and that which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> has wrought and built. Christ has said that we must be saved by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; this these teachers questioned and even denied. For since the announcement was present, but the issue of it future, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> was required. But they bring preoccupied by legal observances threw impediments in the way of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. He seems also here to glance at the Greeks, where he speaks of <q>fables and genealogies,</q> for they enumerated their Gods.</p>
<p><em>Moral</em>. Let us not then give heed to questions. For we were called Faithful, that we might unhesitatingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> what is delivered to us, and entertain no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>. For if the things asserted were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a>, we ought to examine them; but since they are of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, they are only to be revered and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. If we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not, how shall we be persuaded of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a> of a God? For how do you know that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when you call Him to account? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of God is best shown by believing in Him without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> and demonstrations. Even the Greeks <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this; for they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> their Gods telling them, says one, even without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>; and what?— That they were the offspring of the Gods. But why do I speak of the Gods? In the case of the man, a deceiver and sorcerer, (I speak of Pythagoras,) they acted in like manner, for of him it was said, He said it. And over their temples was an image of Silence, and her finger on her mouth, compressing her lips, and significantly exhorting all that passed by to be silent. And were their doctrines so sacred, and are ours less so? And even to be ridiculed? What extreme <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> is this! The tenets of the Greeks indeed are rightly questioned. For they were of that nature, being but disputes, conflicts of reasonings, and doubts, and conclusions. But ours are far from all these. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> wisdom invented theirs, but ours were taught by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit. Their doctrines are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and folly, ours are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom. In their case there is neither teacher nor scholar; but all alike are disputants. Here whether teacher or scholar, each is to learn of him from whom he ought to learn, and not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>; not to dispute, but believe. For all the ancients obtained a good report through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and without this everything is subverted. And why do I speak of it in heavenly things? We shall find upon examination that earthly things depend upon it no less. For without this there would be no trade nor contracts, nor anything of the sort. And if it be so necessary here in things that are false, how much more in those. </p>
<p>This then let us pursue, to this let us adhere, so shall we banish from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> all destructive doctrines, such, for instance, as relate to nativity and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a>. If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that there is a resurrection and a judgment, you will be able to expel from your mind all those false opinions. Believe that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">just</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that there can be an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a> nativity. Believe that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and a Providence, and you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that there can be a nativity, that holds all things together. Believe that there is a place of punishment, and a Kingdom, and you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in a nativity that takes away our free agency, and subjects us to necessity and force. Neither sow, nor plant, nor go to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, nor engage in any work whatever! For whether you will or not, things will proceed according to the course of nativity! What need have we more of Prayer? And why should you deserve to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, if there be this nativity? For you will not then be responsible. And whence proceed the arts of life? Are these too from nativity? Yes, you say, and it is fated to one to become wise with labor. But can you show me one who has learned an art without labor? You cannot. It is not then from nativity but from labor that he derives his skill.</p>
<p>But why does a man who is corrupt and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> become rich, without inheriting it from his father, while another, amidst <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> labors, remains poor? For such are the questions they raise, always arguing upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and poverty, and never taking the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Now in this question talk not of that, but show me a man who has become bad, while he was striving to be good; or one that, without striving, has become good. For if Fate has any power, its power should be shown in the most important things; in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, not in poverty and riches. Again you ask, why is one man sickly and another healthy? Why is one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, another disgraced? Why does every thing succeed well with this man, while another meets with nothing but failure and impediments? Lay aside the notion of nativity, and you will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. Believe firmly that there is a God and a Providence, and all these things will be cleared up. <q>But I cannot,</q> you say, <q>conceive that there is a Providence, when there is such disorder. Can I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that the good God gives <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> to the fornicator, the corrupt and dishonest man, and not to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>? How can I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> this? For there must be facts to ground belief.</q> Well then, do these cases proceed from a nativity that was just, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a>? <q>Unjust,</q> you say. Who then made it? <q>Not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> you say, <q>it was unbegotten.</q> But how can the unbegotten produce these things? For they are contradictions. <q>These things are not then in any wise the works of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> Shall we then enquire who made the earth, the sea, the heavens, the seasons? <q>Nativity,</q> you answer. Did nativity then produce in things inanimate such order and harmony, but in us, for whom these things were made, so much disorder? As if one, in building a house, should be careful to make it magnificent, but bestow not a thought upon his household. But who preserves the succession of the seasons? Who established the regular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of nature? Who appointed the courses of day and night? These things are superior to any such nativity. <q>But these,</q> you say, <q>came to be of themselves.</q> And yet how can such a well-ordered system spring up of itself?</p>
<p><q>But whence,</q> you say, <q>come the rich, the healthy, the renowned, and how are some made rich by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, some by inheritance, some by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>? And why does God suffer the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> to be prosperous?</q> We answer, Because the retribution, according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04749a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">desert</font></u></a> of each, does not take place here, but is reserved for hereafter. Show me any such thing taking place Then! <q>Well,</q> say you, <q>give me here, and I do not look for hereafter.</q> But it is because you seek here, that you receive not. For if when earthly enjoyment is not within your reach, you seek present things so eagerly as to prefer them to future, what would you do if you were in possession of unmixed pleasure? God therefore shows you that these things are nothing, and indifferent; for if they were not indifferent, He would not bestow them on such men. You will own that it is a matter of indifference whether one be tall or short, black or white; so is it whether one be rich or poor. For, tell me, are not things necessary bestowed on all equally, as the capacity for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, the distribution of spiritual gifts? If you understood aright the mercies of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, you would not complain of wanting worldly things, while you enjoyed these best gifts equally with others; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that equal distribution you would not desire superiority in the rest. As if a servant enjoying from his master's bounty food, clothing, and lodging, and all other necessaries equally with his fellow-servants, should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> himself upon having longer nails, or more hair upon his head; so it is for a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> to be elated on account of those things, which he enjoys only for a time. For this reason it is, that God withdraws those things from us, to extinguish this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>, and transfer our affections from them to heaven. But nevertheless we do not learn wisdom. As if a child possessing a toy, should prefer it to things necessary, and his father, to lead him against his will to what was better for him, should deprive him of his toy; so God takes these things from us, that He may lead us to heaven. If you ask then why He permits the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> to be rich, it is because they are not high in His esteem. And if the righteous too are rich, it is rather that He allows it to be, than that He makes them so. Now these things we say superficially, as to men not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>. But our discourses would be unnecessary if you would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> and take heed to the divine word, for that would teach you all things. And that you may understand that neither riches, nor health, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, are anything, I can show you many, who, when they might gain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, do not seek <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>; when they might enjoy health, mortify their bodies; when they might rise to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, make it their aim to be despised. But there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man, who ever studied to be bad. Let us therefore desist from seeking things below, and let us seek heavenly things; for so we shall be able to attain them, and we shall enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> delights, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.

<p><q>Understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</q></p>
<p>Here he censures them, because they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not the end and aim of the Law, nor the period for which it was to have authority. But if it was from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, why is it called a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Because it was incurred not only from their desiring to be teachers of the law, but from their not retaining <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Nay, and their very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> arose from these causes. For when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> abandons itself to carnal things, the clearness of its vision is dimmed, and falling from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> it drops into contentiousness, and the eye of the mind is blinded. For he that is possessed by any desire for these temporal things, intoxicated, as he is, with passion, cannot be an impartial judge of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>. </p>
<p><q>Not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> whereof they affirm.</q></p>
<p>For it is probable that they spoke of the law, and enlarged on its purifications and other bodily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rites</font></u></a>. The Apostle then forbearing to censure these, as either nothing, or at best a shadow and figure of spiritual things, proceeds in a more engaging way to praise the law, calling the Decalogue here the law, and by means of it discarding the rest. For if even these precepts punish transgressors, and become useless to us, much more the others.</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. <q>But we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the law is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, if a man use it lawfully. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> this, that the law is not made for a righteous man.</q></p>
<p>The law, he seems to say, is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, and again, not good. What then? If one use it not lawfully, is it not good? Nay even so it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>. But what he means is this; if any one fulfills it in his actions; for that is to <q>use it lawfully</q> as here intended. But when they expound it in their words, and neglect it in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, that is using it unlawfully. For such an one uses it, but not to his own profit. And another way may be named besides. What is it? That the law, if you use it aright, sends you to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. For since its aim is to justify man, and it fails to effect this, it remits us to Him who can do so. Another way again of using the law lawfully, is when we keep it, but as a thing superfluous. And how as a thing superfluous? As the bridle is properly used, not by the prancing horse that champs it, but by that which wears it only for the sake of appearance, so he uses the law lawfully, who governs himself, though not as constrained by the letter of it. He uses the law lawfully who is conscious that he does not need it, for he who is already so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> that he fulfills it not from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of it, but from a principle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, uses it lawfully and safely: that is, if one so use it, not as being in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of it, but having before his eyes rather the condemnation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> than the punishment hereafter. Moreover he calls him a righteous man, who has attained unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. He therefore uses the law lawfully, who does not require to be instructed by it. For as points in reading are set before children; but he who does what they direct, without their aid, from other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, shows more skill, and is a better reader; so he who is above the law, is not under the schooling of the law. For he keeps it in a much higher degree, who fulfills it not from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> inclination; since he that fears punishment does not fulfill it in the same manner as he that aims at reward. He that is under the law does it not as he that is above the law. For to live above the law is to use it lawfully. He uses it lawfully, and keeps it, who achieves things beyond the law, and who does not need its instructions. For the law, for the most part, is prohibition of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>; now this alone does not make a man righteous, but the performance of good actions besides. Hence those, who abstain from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> like slaves, do not come up to the mark of the law. For it was appointed for the punishment of transgression. Such men indeed use it, but it is to dread its punishment. It is said, <q>Will you not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom013.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 13:3</font></u></a></span>: which implies, that the law threatens punishment only to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>. But of what use is the law to him whose actions deserve a crown? As the surgeon is of use only to him who has some hurt, and not to the sound and healthy man. <q>But for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.</q> He calls the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> <q>lawless and disobedient</q> too. <q>The law (he says) works <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>,</q> that is, to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doers. But what to him who is deserving of reward? <q>By the law is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 3:20</font></u></a></span> What then with respect to the righteous? <q>the law is not made,</q> he says, <q>for a righteous man.</q> Wherefore? Because he is exempted from its punishment, and he waits not to learn from it what is his duty, since he has the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit within to direct him. For the law was given that men might be chastened by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of its threatenings. But the tractable horse needs not the curb, nor the man that can dispense with instruction the schoolmaster.</p>
<p><q>But for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unholy</font></u></a> and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers.</q> Thus he does not stop at the mention of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> in general, nor of these only, but goes over the several kinds of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, to shame men, as it were, of being under the direction of the law; and having thus particularized some, he adds a reference to those omitted, though what he had enumerated were sufficient to withdraw men. Of whom then does he say these things? Of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, for they were <q>murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers</q>: they were <q>profane and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unholy</font></u></a>,</q> for these too he means when he says, <q>ungodly and sinners,</q> and being such, the law was necessarily given to them. For did they not repeatedly worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>? Did they not stone <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>? Were not their hands imbrued in the blood of their kindred? Do not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> constantly accuse them of these things? But to those who are instructed by a heavenly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, these commandments are superfluous. <q>For murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>, for menstealers, for liers, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjured</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine</q>; for all the things which he had mentioned were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> of a corrupted <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and contrary, therefore, to sound doctrine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 11</font></u></a>. <q>According to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of the blessed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, which was committed to my trust.</q></p>
<p>Thus the Law is still necessary for the confirmation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, yet to those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> it is unnecessary. And he calls the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>.</q> There were some who were ashamed of its <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecutions</font></u></a>, and of the sufferings of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and so for the sake of these, as well as for others, he has called it <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>,</q> thus showing that the sufferings of Christ are our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. And perhaps he glances too at the future. For if our present state is exposed to shame and reproach, it will not be so hereafter; and it is to things future, and not to things present, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> belongs. Why then did the Angel say, <q>Behold, I bring you good tidings of great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, for unto you is born a Saviour</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 2:10</font></u></a></span> Because He was born to be their Saviour, though His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> did not commence from His birth. <q>According to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>of the blessed God.</q> The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> he means is either that of the service of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, or, in that if present things are filled with its <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, yet much more will things future be so; when <q>His enemies shall be put under His feet</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:25</font></u></a></span>, when there shall be nothing opposed, when the just shall behold all those blessed things, which <q>eye has not seen, nor ear heard, and which has not entered into the heart of man.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co002.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 2:9</font></u></a></span> <q>For I will</q> says our Saviour, <q>that they also may be with Me, where I am, that they may behold My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, which You have given Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh017.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 17:24</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><em>Moral</em>. Let us then learn who these are, and let us esteem them blessed, considering what felicities they will then enjoy, of what light and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> they will then participate. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of this world is worthless and not enduring, or if it abides, it abides but till death, and after that is wholly extinguished. For <q>his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>shall not descend after him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa048.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 49:17</font></u></a></span> And with many it lasts not even to the end of life. But no such thing is to be thought of in that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; it abides, and will have no end. For such are the things of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, enduring, and above all change or end. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of that state is not from without, but from within. I mean, it consists not in a multitude of servant, or of chariot, nor in costly garments. Independently of these things, the man himself is clothed with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Here, without these things, the man appears naked. In the baths, we see the illustrious, the undistinguished, and the base, alike bare. Often have the great been exposed to danger in public, being left on some occasion by their servants. But in that world men carry their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> about with them, and the Saints, like the Angels, wherever they appear, have their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> in themselves. Yea rather as the sun needs no vestures, and requires no foreign aid, but wherever he appears, his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> at once shines forth; so shall it then be.</p>
<p>Let us then pursue that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, than which nothing is more venerable; and leave the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the world, as beyond anything worthless. <q>Boast not of your clothing and raiment.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir011.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 11:4</font></u></a></span> This was the advice given of old to the simple. Indeed the dancer, the harlot, the player, are arrayed in a gayer and more costly robe than you. And besides, this boasting were of that, which if but moths attack, they can rob you of its enjoyment. Do you see what an unstable thing it is, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the present life? Thou pridest yourself upon that which insects make and destroy. For Indian insects, it is said, spin those fine threads of which your robes are made. But rather seek a clothing woven from things above, an admirable and radiant vesture, raiment of real gold; of gold not dug by malefactors' hands out of the mine, but the produce of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Let us clothe ourselves with a robe not the manufacture of poor men or slaves, but wrought by our Lord Himself. But your garments, you say, are in-wrought with gold! And what is that to you? He that wrought it, not he that wears it, is the object of admiration, for there it is really due. It is not the frame on which the garment is stretched at the fuller's, but the maker of it, that is admired. Yet the block wears it, and has it bound on itself. And as that wears it, but not for use, even so do some of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, for the benefit of the garment, to air it, they say, that it may not be moth-eaten! Is it not then the extreme of folly to be solicitous about a thing so worthless, to do anything whatever, to risk your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> for it, to make a mock at Hell, to set God at defiance, to overlook Christ hungering? Talk not of the precious spices of India, Arabia, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>, the moist and the dry, the perfumes and ointments, so costly and so useless. Why, O <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, do you lavish perfumes upon a body full of impurity within? Why spend on what is offensive, as if one should waste perfumes upon dirt, or distill balms upon a brick. There is, if you desire it, a precious ointment and a fragrance, with which you might anoint your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; not brought from Arabia, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05566a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ethiopia</font></u></a>, nor from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>, but from heaven itself; purchased not by gold, but by a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> will, and by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> unfeigned. Buy this perfume, the odor of which is able to fill the world. It was of this the Apostles savored. <q>For we are (he says) a sweet savor, to some of death, to others of life.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</font></u></a></span> And what means this? That it is as they say, that the swine is suffocated by perfumes! But this spiritual fragrance scented not only the bodies but the garments of the Apostles; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> garments were so impregnated with it, that they cast out devils. What balmy leaf, what cassia, what myrrh so sweet or so efficacious as this perfume? For if it put devils to flight, what could it not effect? With this ointment let us furnish ourselves. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit will provide it through almsgiving. Of these we shall savor, when we go into the other world. And as here, he that is perfumed with sweet odors draws upon himself the notice of all, and whether at the bath, or the assembly, or any other concourse of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, all follow him, and observe him; so, in that world, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> come in that are fragrant with this spiritual savor, all arise and make room. And even here devils and all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vices</font></u></a> are afraid to approach it, and cannot endure it, for it chokes them. Let us then not bear about us that perfume which is a mark of effeminacy, but this, which is a mark of manhood, which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> admirable, which fills us with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> confidence. This is a spice which is not the produce of the earth, but springs from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, which withers not, but blooms for ever. This is it that renders those who possess it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>. With this we are anointed at our Baptism, then we savor sweetly of it; but it must be by our care afterwards that we retain the savor. Of old the Priests were anointed with ointment, as an emblem of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, the fragrance of which a Priest should diffuse around him.</p>
<p>But nothing is more offensive than the savor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, which made the Psalmist say, <q>My wounds stink and are corrupt.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa037.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 38:5</font></u></a></span> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is more foul than putrefaction itself. What, for instance, is more offensive than fornication? And if this is not perceived at the time of its commission, yet, after it is committed, its offensive nature, the impurity contracted in it, and the curse, and the abomination of it is perceived. So it is with all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. Before it is committed it has something of pleasure, but after its commission, the pleasure ceases and fades away, and pain and shame succeed. But with righteousness it is the reverse. At the beginning it is attended with toil, but in the end with pleasure and repose. But even here, as in the one case the pleasure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is no pleasure, because of the expectation of disgrace and punishment, so in the other the toil is not felt as toil, by reason of the hope of reward. And what is the pleasure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>? The poor gratification of drinking, and hardly that. For when insensibility follows, and the man sees nothing that is before him, and is in a worse state than a madman, what enjoyment remains? Nay, one might well say there is no pleasure in fornication itself. For when passion has deprived the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of its judgment, can there be any real delights? As well might we say that the itch is a pleasure! I should call that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> pleasure, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is not affected by passion, not agitated nor overpowered by the body. For what pleasure can it be to grind the teeth, to distort the eyes, to be irritated and inflamed beyond decency? But so far is it from being pleasant, that men hasten to escape from it, and when it is over are in pain. But if it were pleasure, they would wish not to escape from it, but to continue it. It has therefore only the name of pleasure.</p>
<p>But not such are the pleasures enjoyed by us; they are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> delightful, they do not agitate nor inflame. They leave the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> free, and cheer and expand it. Such was the pleasure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> when he said, <q>In this I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>, yea, and I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a></q>; and again, <q>Rejoice in the Lord always.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 1:18</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">4:4</font></u></a></span> For sinful pleasure is attended with shame and condemnation; it is indulged in secret, and is attended with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> uneasiness. But from all these the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> pleasure is exempt. This then let us pursue, that we may attain those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom, etc.</p>

<p>The advantages arising from humility are generally acknowledged, and yet it is a thing not easily to be met with. There is affectation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> talking enough and to spare, but humbleness of mind is nowhere to be found. This quality was so cultivated by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>, that he is ever looking out for inducements to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>. They who are conscious to themselves of great merits must struggle much with themselves if they would be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>. And he too was one likely to be under violent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, his own good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> swelling him up like a gathering humor. Observe therefore his method in this place. <q>I was entrusted,</q> he had said, <q>with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, of which they who still adhere to the law have no right to partake; for it is now opposed to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, and their difference is such, that those who are actuated by the one, are as yet unworthy to partake of the other; as we should say, that those who require punishments, and chains, have no right to be admitted into the train of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a>.</q> Being filled therefore with high thoughts, and having used magnificent expressions, he at once depresses himself, and engages others also to do the like. Having said therefore that <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> was committed to his trust</q>; lest this should seem to be said from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, he checks himself at once, adding by way of correction, <q>I thank <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, who has enabled me, for that He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.</q> Thus everywhere, we see, he conceals his own merit, and ascribes everything to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, yet so far only, as not to take away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free will</font></u></a>. For the unbeliever might perhaps say, If everything is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and we contribute nothing of ourselves, while He turns us, as if we were mere wood and stone, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of wisdom, why then did He make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> such as he was, and not Judas? To remove this objection, mark the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a> of his expression, <q>Which was committed,</q> he says, <q>to my trust.</q> This was his own excellence and merit, but not wholly his own; for he says, <q>I thank Christ Jesus, who enabled me.</q> This is God's part: then his own again, <q>Because He counted me faithful.</q> Surely because he would be serviceable of his own part.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 13</font></u></a>. <q>Putting me into his service, who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorantly</font></u></a> in unbelief.</q></p>
<p>Thus we see him acknowledge both his own part and that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and while he ascribes the greater part to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, he extenuates his own, yet so far only, as we said before, as was consistent with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free will</font></u></a>. And what is this, <q>Who enabled me</q>? I will tell you. He had so heavy a burden to sustain, that he needed much aid from above. For think what it was to be exposed to daily insults, and mockeries, and snares, and dangers, scoffs, and reproaches, and deaths; and not to faint, or slip, or turn backward, but though assaulted every day with darts innumerable, to bear up manfully, and remain firm and imperturbable. This was the effect of no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> power, and yet not of Divine influence alone, but of his own resolution also. For that Christ chose him with a foreknowledge of what he would be, is plain from the testimony He bore to him before the commencement of his preaching. <q>He is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and kings.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:15</font></u></a></span> For as those who bear the royal standard in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> require both strength and address, that they may not let it fall into the hands of the enemy; so those who sustain the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, not only in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> but in peace, need a mighty strength, to preserve it uninjured from the attacks of accusers. Great indeed is the strength required to bear the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and to sustain it well, and bear the Cross. For he who in action, or word, or thought, does anything unworthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, does not sustain His name, and has not Christ dwelling in him. For he that sustains that name bears it in triumph, not in the concourse of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but through the very heavens, while all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> stand in awe, and attend upon him, and admire him.</p>
<p><q>I thank the Lord, who has enabled me.</q> Observe how he thanks God even for that which was his own part. For he acknowledges it as a favor from Him that he was <q>a chosen vessel.</q> For this, O <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>, was your own part. <q>For God is no respecter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>.</q> But I thank Him that he <q>thought me worthy of this ministry.</q> For this is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that He esteemed me faithful. The steward in a house is not only thankful to his master that he is trusted, but considers it as a sign that he holds him more faithful than others: so it is here. Then observe how he magnifies the mercy and loving-kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in describing his former life, <q>who was formerly,</q> he says, <q>a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.</q> And when he speaks of the still unbelieving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, he rather extenuates their guilt. <q>For I bear them record that they have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but not according to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:2</font></u></a></span> But of himself he says, <q>Who was a blasphemer and a persecutor.</q> Observe his lowering of himself! So free was he from self-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, so full of humility, that he is not satisfied to call himself a persecutor and a blasphemer, but he aggravates his guilt, showing that it did not stop with himself, that it was not enough that he Gas a blasphemer, but in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> those who were willing to be godly. </p>
<p><q>But I obtained mercy because I did it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorantly</font></u></a> in unbelief.</q></p>
<p>Why then did other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> not obtain mercy? Because what they did, they did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorantly</font></u></a>, but willfully, well <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what they did. For this we have the testimony of the Evangelist. <q>Many of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> on Him, but because of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a> they did not confess Him. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh012.htm#verse42" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 12:42-43</font></u></a></span> And Christ again said to them, <q>How can you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, who receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> one of another</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:44</font></u></a></span>? And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> of the blind man <q>said these things for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, lest they should be put out of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogue</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh009.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 9:22</font></u></a></span> Nay the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> themselves said, <q>Perceive how we avail nothing? Behold, the world is gone after Him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh012.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 12:19</font></u></a></span> Thus their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of power was everywhere in their way. When they admitted that no one can forgive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> only, and Christ immediately did that very thing, which they had confessed to be a sign of divinity, this could not be a case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>. But where was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> then? Perhaps one should say he was sitting at the feet of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06374b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gamaliel</font></u></a>, and took no part with the multitude who conspired against Jesus: for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06374b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gamaliel</font></u></a> does not appear to have been an ambitious man. Then how is it that afterwards <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was found joining with the multitude? He saw the doctrine growing, and on the point of prevailing, and being generally embraced. For in the lifetime of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> consorted with Him, and afterwards with their teachers, but when they were completely separated, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> did not act as the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> did, from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of power, but from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>. For what was the motive of his journey to Damascus? He thought the doctrine pernicious, and was afraid that the preaching of it would spread everywhere.

Yet they who spent their days on lakes and rivers, and the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publicans</font></u></a>, have embraced the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, while you that study the law are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuting</font></u></a> it! It is for this he condemns himself, saying, <q>I am not meet to be called an Apostle.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co009.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 9:9</font></u></a></span> It is for this he confesses his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, which was produced by unbelief. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, he says, that he obtained <q>mercy.</q> What then does he mean when he says, <q>He counted me faithful</q>? He would give up no right of his Master's: even his own part he ascribed to Him, and assumed nothing to himself, nor claimed for his own the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> which was due to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Hence in another place we find him exclaiming, <q>Sirs, why do ye these things to us? We also are men of like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> with you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act014.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 14:15</font></u></a></span> So again, <q>He counted me faithful.</q> And again, <q>I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God which was with me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:10</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>It is He that works in us both to will and to do.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi002.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 2:13</font></u></a></span> Thus in acknowledging that he <q>obtained mercy,</q> he owns that he deserved punishment, since mercy is for such. And again in another place he says of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, <q>Blindness in part is happened to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 11:25</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 14</font></u></a>. <q>And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of our Lord was exceeding abundant with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>This is added, lest hearing that he obtained mercy, we should understand by it only, that being deserving of punishment, as a persecutor and blasphemer, nevertheless he was not punished. But mercy was not confined to this, that punishment was not inflicted; many other great favors are implied by it. For not only has God released us from the impending punishment, but He has made us <q>righteous</q> too, and <q>sons,</q> and <q>brethren,</q> and <q>heirs,</q> and <q>joint-heirs.</q> Therefore it is he says, that <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> was exceeding abundant.</q> For the gifts bestowed were beyond mercy, since they are not such as would come of mercy only, but of affection and excessive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Having thus enlarged upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of God which, not content with showing mercy to a blasphemer and persecutor, conferred upon him other blessings in abundance, he has guarded against that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> of the unbelievers which takes away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free will</font></u></a>, by adding, <q>with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>.</q> Thus much only, he says, did we contribute. We have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> that He is able to save us.</p>
<p><em>Moral</em>. Let us then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> God through Christ. What means <q>through Christ</q>? That it is He, and not the Law, who has enabled us to do this. Observe what blessings we owe to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and what to the Law. And he says not merely that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> has abounded, but <q>abounded exceedingly,</q> in bringing at once to the adoption those who deserved <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> punishment.</p>
<p>And observe again that <q>in</q> is used for <q>through.</q> For not only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is necessary, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Since there are many still who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, who yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him not, nor act like those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him. For how is it when they prefer everything to Him, money, nativity, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a>, augury, divinations, omens? When we live in defiance of Him, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, where is our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>? Has any one a warm and affectionate friend? Let him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Christ but equally. So, if no more, let him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him who gave His Son for us His enemies, who had no merits of our own. Merits did I say? Who had committed numberless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, who had dared Him beyond all daring, and without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>! Yet He, after numberless instances of goodness and care, did not even then cast us off. At the very time when we did Him the greatest wrong, then did He give His Son for us. And still we, after so great benefits, after being made His friends, and counted worthy through Him of all blessings, have not loved Him as our friend! What hope then can be ours? You shudder perhaps at the word, but I would that you shuddered at the fact! What? How shall it appear that we do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> God even as our friends, you say? I will endeavor to show you— and would that my words were groundless, and to no purpose! But I am afraid they are borne out by facts. For consider: friends, that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> friends, will often suffer loss for those they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. But for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, no one will suffer loss, or even be content with his present state. For a friend we can readily submit to insults, and undertake quarrels; but for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, no one can endure enmity: and the saying is, <q>Be loved for nothing— but be not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> for nothing.</q></p>
<p>None of us would fail to relieve a friend who was hungering, but when Christ comes to us from day to day, and asks no great matter, but only bread, we do not even regard him, yea though we are nauseously over full, and swollen with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a>: though our breath betrays the wine of yesterday, and we live in luxury, and waste our substance on harlots and parasites and flatterers, and even on monsters, idiots, and dwarfs; for men convert the natural defects of such into matter for amusement. Again, friends, that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> such, we do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, nor are mortified at their success, yet we feel this toward (the minister of) Christ, and our friendship for men is seen to be more powerful than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> and the insincere plainly respect men more than God. And how is this? God sees the heart, yet man does not forbear to practice deceit in His sight; yet if the same man were detected in deceit by men, he thinks himself undone, and blushes for shame. And why speak of this? If a friend be in distress, we visit him, and should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> to be condemned, if we deferred it for a little time. But we do not visit Christ, though He die again and again in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>; nay, if we have friends among the faithful, we visit them, not because they are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>, but because they are our friends. Thus we do nothing from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but some things from friendship, some from custom. When we see a friend depart on travel, we weep and are troubled, and if we see his death, we bewail him, though we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that we shall not be long separated, that he will be restored to us at the Resurrection. But though Christ departs from us, or rather we reject Him daily, we do not grieve, nor think it strange, to injure, to offend, to provoke Him by doing what is displeasing to Him; and the fearful thing is not that we do not treat Him as a friend; for I will show that we even treat Him as an enemy. How, do you ask? Because <q>the carnal mind is enmity against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> has said, and this we always carry about us. And we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecute</font></u></a> Christ, when He advances toward us, and comes to our very doors. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> actions in effect do this, and every day we subject him to insults by our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> and our rapacity. And does any one by preaching His word, and benefiting His Church, obtain a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a>? Then he is the object of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, because he does the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And we think that we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> him, but our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> passes on to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. We affect to wish the benefit to come not from others, but from ourselves. But this cannot be for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> sake, but for our own: otherwise, it would be a matter of indifference, whether the good were done by others or ourselves. If a physician found himself unable to cure his son, who was threatened with blindness, would he reject the aid of another, who was able to effect the cure? Far from it! <q>Let my son be restored,</q> he would almost say to him, <q>whether it is to be by you or by me.</q> And why? Because he would not consider himself, but what was beneficial to his son. So, were our regard <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>,</q> it would lead us to say, <q>Let good be done, whether by ourselves or by any other.</q> As <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said, <q>Whether in pretense or in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> Christ is preached.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 1:18</font></u></a></span>. In the same spirit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> answered, when some would have excited his displeasure against Eldad and Modad, because they prophesied, <q>Do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>!</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 11:29</font></u></a></span> These jealous feelings proceed from vainglory; and are they not those of opponents and enemies? Does any one speak ill of you? Love him! It is impossible, you say. Nay, if you will, it is quite possible. For if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> him only who speaks well of you, what thanks have you? It is not for the Lord's sake, but for the sake of the man's kind speech that you do it. Has any one injured you? Do him good! For in benefiting him who has benefited you there is little merit. Have you been deeply wronged and suffered loss? Make a point of requiting it with the contrary. Yes, I entreat you. Let this be the way we do our own part. Let us cease from hating and injuring our enemies. He commands us <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> our enemies</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:44</font></u></a></span>: but we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecute</font></u></a> Him while He loves us. God forbid! We all say in words, but not so in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>. So darkened are our minds by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, that we tolerate in our actions what in words we think intolerable. Let us desist then from things that are injurious and ruinous to our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, that we may obtain those blessings which as His friends we may obtain. For Christ says, <q>I will that where I am, there My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> may be also, that they may behold My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh017.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 17:24</font></u></a></span>, which may we all attain, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</p>

For God has bestowed upon us such things as the mind of man never looked for, never thought of. It is for this reason that the Apostles spend much discourse in securing a belief of the gifts that are granted us of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For as men, upon receiving some great good, ask themselves if it is not a dream, as not believing it; so it is with respect to the gifts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. What then was it that was thought incredible? That those who were enemies, and sinners, neither justified by the law, nor by works, should immediately through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> alone be advanced to the highest favor. Upon this head accordingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> has discoursed at length in his Epistle to the Romans, and here again at length. <q>This is a faithful saying,</q> he says, <q>and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.</q></p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were chiefly attracted by this, he persuades them not to give heed to the law, since they could not attain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> by it without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Against this he contends; for it seemed to them incredible, that a man who had mis-spent all his former life in vain and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> actions, should afterwards be saved by his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> alone. On this account he says, <q>It is a saying to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> But some not only disbelieved but even objected, as the Greeks do now. <q>Let us then do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, that good may come.</q> This was the consequence they drew in derision of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, from his words, <q>Where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> abounded <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> did much more abound.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 3:8</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">5:20</font></u></a></span> So when we discourse to them of Hell they say, How can this be worthy of God? When man has found his servant offending, he forgives it, and thinks him worthy of pardon and does God punish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternally</font></u></a>? And when we speak of the Laver, and of the remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> through it, this too they say is unworthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that he who has committed offenses without number should have his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> remitted. What perverseness of mind is this, what a spirit of contention does it manifest! Surely if forgiveness is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, punishment is a good; but if punishment is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, remission of it is a good. I speak according to their notions, for according to ours, both are good. This I shall show at another time, for the present would not suffice for a matter so deep, and which requires to be elaborately argued. I must lay it before your Charity at a fitting season. At present let us proceed with our proposed subject. <q>This is a faithful saying,</q> he says. But why is it to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>This appears both from what precedes and from what follows. Observe how he prepares us for this assertion, and how he then dwells upon it. For he has previously declared that He showed mercy to me <q>a blasphemer and a persecutor</q>; this was in the way of preparation. And not only did He show mercy, but <q>He accounted me faithful.</q> So far should we be, he means, from disbelieving that He showed mercy. For no one, who should see a prisoner admitted into a palace, could <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> whether he obtained mercy. And this was visibly the situation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, for he makes himself the example. Nor is he ashamed to call himself a sinner, but rather delights in it, as he thus can best demonstrate the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> of God's regard for him, and that He had thought him worthy of such extraordinary kindness.</p>
<p>But how is it, that he here calls himself a sinner, nay, the chief of sinners, whereas he elsewhere asserts that he was <q>touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:6</font></u></a></span> Because with respect to the righteousness which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has wrought, the justification which is really sought, even those who are righteous in the law are sinners, <q>for all have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, and come short of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 3:23</font></u></a></span> Therefore he does not say righteousness simply, but <q>the righteousness which is in the law.</q> As a man that has acquired <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, with respect to himself appears rich, but upon a comparison with the treasures of kings is very poor and the chief of the poor; so it is in this case. Compared with Angels, even righteous men are sinners; and if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, who wrought the righteousness that is in the law, was the chief of sinners, what other man can be called righteous? For he says not this to condemn his own life as impure, let not this be imagined; but comparing his own legal righteousness with the righteousness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, he shows it to be nothing worth, and not only so, but he proves those who possess it to be sinners.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 16</font></u></a>. <q>Howbeit for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> I obtained mercy, that in me first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him to life everlasting.</q></p>
<p>See how he further humbles and depreciates himself, by naming a fresh and less creditable reason. For that he obtained mercy on account of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, does not so much imply that he who obtained mercy was a sinner, or under deep condemnation; but to say that he obtained mercy in order that no sinner hereafter might despair of finding mercy, but that each might feel sure of obtaining the like favor, this is an excess of humiliation, such that even in calling himself the chief of sinners, <q>a blasphemer and a persecutor, and one not meet to be called an Apostle,</q> he had said nothing like it. This will appear by an example. Suppose a populous city, all whose inhabitants were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, some more so, and some less, but all deserving of condemnation; and let one among that multitude be more deserving of punishment than all the rest, and guilty of every kind of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. If it were declared that the king was willing to pardon all, it would not be so readily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, as if they were to see this most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> wretch actually pardoned. There could then be no longer any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>. This is what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, willing to give men full assurance that He pardons all their transgressions, chose, as the object of His mercy, him who was more a sinner than any; for when I obtained mercy, he argues, there could be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> of others: as familiarly speaking we might say, <q>If God pardons such an one, he will never punish anybody</q>; and thus he shows that he himself, though unworthy of pardon, for the sake of others' <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, first obtained that pardon. Therefore, he says, since I am saved, let no one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. And observe the humility of this blessed man; he says not, <q>that in me he might show forth</q> His <q>longsuffering,</q> but <q>all longsuffering</q>; as if he had said, greater longsuffering He could not show in any case than in mine, nor find a sinner that so required all His pardon, all His long-suffering; not a part only, like those who are only partially sinners, but <q>all</q> His longsuffering.</p>
<p><q>For a pattern to those who should hereafter <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>.</q> This is said for comfort, for encouragement. But because he had spoken highly of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and of the great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> which He has manifested, lest he should be thought to exclude the Father from this, he ascribes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to Him also.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 17</font></u></a>. <q>Now unto the King <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>, invisible, the only wise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> for ever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>For these things, then, we glorify not the Son only, but the Father. Here let us argue with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>. Speaking of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, he says, <q>To the only God.</q> Is the Son then not God? <q>The only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>.</q> Is the Son then not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>? Or does He not possess that Himself, which hereafter He will give to us? Yes, they say, He is God and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>, but not such as the Father. What then? Is He of inferior <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">essence</font></u></a>, and therefore of inferior <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>? What then is a greater and a less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>? For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a> is nothing else than the not being subject to destruction. For there is a greater and a less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a> does not admit of being greater or less: as neither is there a greater and a less health. For a thing must either be destructible, or altogether indestructible. Are we men then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> even as He? God forbid! Surely not! Why? Because He has it by nature, but we adventitiously. Why then do you make the difference? Because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, he says, is made such as He is by no other: but the Son is what He is, from the Father. This we also confess, not denying that the Son is generated from the Father incorruptibly. And we glorify the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, he means, for having generated the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, such as He is. Thus you see the Father is most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, when the Son has done great things. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the Son is referred again to Him. And since He generated Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">omnipotent</font></u></a> and such as He is in Himself, it is not more the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the Son than of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, that He is self-sufficient, and self-maintained, and free from infirmity. It has been said of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, <q>By whom He made the worlds.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb001.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 1:2</font></u></a></span> Now there is a distinction observed among us between creation and workmanship. For one works and toils and executes, another rules; and why? Because he that executes is the inferior. But it is not so there; nor is the sovereignty with One, the workmanship with the Other. For when we hear, <q>By whom He made the worlds,</q> we do not exclude the Father from creation. Nor when we say, <q>To the King <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>,</q> do we deny dominion to the Son. For these are common to the One and the Other, and each belongs to Both. The Father created, in that He begot the creating Son; the Son rules, as being Lord of all things created. For He does not work for hire, nor in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> to others, as workmen do among us, but from His own goodness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. But has the Son ever been seen? No one can affirm this. What means then, <q>To the King <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>, invisible, the only wise God</q>? Or when it is said, <q>There is no other name whereby we must be saved</q>: and again, <q>There is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> in no other</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:12</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>To Him be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> forever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> are not mere words; and since He has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> us not by words only, but by what He has done for us, so let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> Him by works and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>. Yet this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> touches us, while that reaches not Him, for He needs not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> that comes from us, we do need that which is from Him.</p>
<p>In honoring Him, therefore, we do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to ourselves. He who opens his eyes to gaze on the light of the sun, receives delight himself, as he admires the beauty of the star, but does no favor to that luminary, nor increases its splendor, for it continues what it was; much more is this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> with respect to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He who admires and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> God does so to his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and highest benefit; and how? Because he follows after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> by Him. For <q>them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> Me,</q> He says, <q>I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa004.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 4:30</font></u></a></span> How then is He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, if He enjoys no advantage from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>? Just as He is said to hunger and thirst. For He assumes everything that is ours, that He may in anywise attract us to Him. He is said to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>, and even insults, that we may be afraid. But with all this we are not attracted towards Him!</p>
<p><em>Moral</em>. Let us then <q>glorify <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and bear God both <q>in our body and in our spirit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:20</font></u></a></span> And how is one to glorify Him in the body? Says one, and how in the spirit? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is here called the spirit to distinguish it from the body. But how may we glorify Him in the body and in the spirit? He glorifies Him in the body, who does not commit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> or fornication, who avoids <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, who does not affect a showy exterior, who makes such provision for himself as is sufficient for health only: and so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, who does not perfume nor paint her person, but is satisfied to be such as God made her, and adds no device of her own. For why do you add your own embellishments to the work which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> made? Is not His workmanship sufficient for you? Or do you endeavor to add <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> to it, as if forsooth you were the better artist? It is not for yourself, but to attract crowds of lovers, that you thus adornest your person, and insultest your Creator. And do not say, <q>What can I do? It is no wish of my own, but I must do it for my husband. I cannot win his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> except I consent to this.</q> God made you beautiful, that He might be admired even in your beauty, and not that He might be insulted. Do not therefore make Him so ill a return, but requite Him with modesty and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03637d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">chastity</font></u></a>. God made you beautiful, that He might increase the trials of your modesty. For it is much harder for one that is lovely to be modest, than for one who has no such attractions, for which to be courted. Why does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> tell us, that <q>Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen039.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 39:6</font></u></a></span>, but that we might the more admire his modesty coupled with beauty? Has God made you beautiful? Why do you make yourself otherwise? For as though one should overlay a golden <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13641b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">statue</font></u></a> with a daubing of mire, so it is with those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> that use paints. Thou besmearest yourself with red and white earth! But the homely, you say, may fairly have recourse to this. And why? To hide their ugliness? It is a vain attempt. For when was the natural appearance improved upon by that which is studied and artificial? And why should you be troubled at your want of beauty, since it is no reproach? For hear the saying of the Wise Man, <q>Commend not a man for his beauty, neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir011.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 11:2</font></u></a></span> Let God be rather admired, the best Artificer, and not man, who has no merit in being made such as he is. What are the advantages, tell me, of beauty? None. It exposes its possessor to greater trials, mishaps, perils, and suspicions. She that wants it escapes suspicion; she that possesses it, except she practice a great and extraordinary reserve, incurs an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report, and what is worse than all, the suspicion of her husband, who takes less pleasure in beholding her beauty, than he suffers pain from jealousy. And her beauty fades in his sight from familiarity, while she suffers in her character from the imputation of weakness, dissipation, and wantonness, and her very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> becomes degraded and full of haughtiness. To these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> personal beauty is exposed. But she who has not this attraction, escapes unmolested. The dogs do not assail her; she is like a lamb, reposing in a secure pasture, where no wolf intrudes to harass her, because the shepherd is at hand to protect her.</p>
<p>The real superiority is, not that one is fair, and the other homely, but it is a superiority that one, even if she is not fair, is unchaste, and the other is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>. Tell me wherein is the perfection of eyes? Is it in their being soft, and rolling, and round, and dark, or in their clearness and quicksightedness. Is it the perfection of a lamp to be elegantly formed, and finely turned, or to shine brightly, and to enlighten the whole house? We cannot say it is not this, for the other is indifferent, and this the real object. Accordingly we often say to the maid whose charge it is, <q>You have made a bad lamp of it.</q> So entirely is it the use of a lamp to give light. So it matters not what is the appearance of the eye, while it performs its office with full efficiency. We call the eye bad, which is dim or disordered, and which, when open, does not see. For that is bad, which does not perform its proper office— and this is the fault of eyes. And for a nose, tell me, when is it a good one? When it is straight, and polished on either side, and finely proportioned? Or when it is quick to receive odors, and transmit them to the brain? Any one can answer this.</p>
<p>Come now, let us illustrate this by an example— as of gripers, I mean the instruments so called; we say those are well-made, which are able to take up and hold things, not those which are only handsomely and elegantly shaped. So those are good teeth which are fit for the service of dividing and chewing our food, not those which are beautifully set. And applying the same reasoning to other parts of the body, we shall call those members beautiful, which are sound, and perform their proper functions aright. So we think any instrument, or plant, or animal good, not because of its form or color, but because it answers its purpose. And he is thought a good servant, who is useful and ready for our service, not one who is comely but dissolute. I trust you now understand how it is in your power to be beautiful.</p>
<p>And since the greatest and most important benefits are equally enjoyed by all, we are under no disadvantage. Whether we are beautiful or not, we alike behold this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15183a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">universe</font></u></a>, the sun, the moon, and the stars; we breathe the same air, we partake alike of water, and the fruits of the earth. And if we may say what will sound strange, the homely are more healthy than the beautiful. For these, to preserve their beauty, engage in no labor, but give themselves up to indolence and delicate living, by which their bodily energies are impaired; while the others, having no such care, spend all their attention simply and entirely on active pursuits.</p>
<p>Let us then <q>glorify <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and take and bear Him in our body.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:20</font></u></a></span> Let us not affect a beautiful appearance; that care is vain and unprofitable. Let us not teach our husbands to admire the mere outward form; for if such be your adornment, his very habit of viewing your face will make him easy to be captivated by a harlot. But if you teach him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> good manners, and modesty, he will not be ready to wander, for he will see no attractions in a harlot, in whom those qualities are not found, but the reverse. Neither teach him to be captivated by laughter, nor by a loose dress, lest you prepare a poison against yourself. Accustom him to delight in modesty, and this you will do, if your attire be modest. But if you have a flaunting air, an unsteady manner, how can you address him in a serious strain? And who will not hold you in contempt and derision?</p>
<p>But how is it possible to glorify God in our spirit? By practicing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, by adorning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. For such embellishment is not forbidden. Thus we glorify <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when we are good in every respect, and we shall be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> by Him in a much higher degree in that great day. For <q>I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that shall be revealed in us.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:18</font></u></a></span> Of which that we may all be partakers, God grant, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:18, 19</strong></p>
<p><q><em>This charge I commit unto you, son [my child</em>, <span>τέκνον</span> <em>] Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might [may] <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> a good warfare; holding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>; which some having put away have made shipwreck concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</em></q></p>
<p>The office of a Teacher and that of a Priest is of great dignity, and to bring forward one that is worthy requires a divine election. So it was of old, and so it is now, when we make a choice without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> passion, not looking to any temporal consideration, swayed neither by friendship, nor enmity. For though we be not partakers of so great a measure of the Spirit as they, yet a good purpose is sufficient to draw unto us the election of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For the Apostles, when they elected Matthias, had not yet received the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, but having committed the matter to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, they chose him into the number of the Apostles. For they looked not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> friendships. And so now too it ought to be with us. But we have advanced to the extreme of negligence; and even what is clearly evident, we let pass. Now when we overlook what is manifest, how will God reveal to us what is unseen? As it is said, <q>If you have not been faithful in that which is little, who will commit to you that which is great and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk016.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 16:11</font></u></a></span> But then, when nothing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> was done, the appointment of Priests too was by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. What is <q>by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a></q>? By the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> is not only the telling of things future, but also of the present. It was by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> that Saul was discovered <q>hidden among the stuff.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa010.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 10:22</font></u></a></span> For God reveals things to the righteous. So it was said by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, <q>Separate me Barnabas and Saul.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:2</font></u></a></span> In this way Timothy also was chosen, concerning whom he speaks of prophecies in the plural; that, perhaps, upon which he <q>took and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> him,</q> and when he ordained him, as he himself says in his Epistle to him, <q>Neglect not the gift that is in you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:14</font></u></a></span> Therefore to elevate him, and prepare him to be sober and watchful, he reminds him by whom he was chosen and ordained, as if he had said, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has chosen you. He gave you your commission, you were not made by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> vote. Do not therefore abuse or bring into disgrace the appointment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> When again he speaks of a charge, which implies something burdensome, he adds, <q>This charge I commit to you, son Timothy.</q> He charges him as his son, his own son, not so much with arbitrary or despotic authority as like a father, he says, <q>my son Timothy.</q> The <q>committing,</q> however, implies that it is to be diligently kept, and that it is not our own. For we did not obtain it for ourselves, but God conferred it upon us; and not it only, but also <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>.</q> What He has given us then, let us keep. For if He had not come, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> had not been to be found, nor that pure life which we learn by education. As if he had said, <q>It is not I that charge you, but He who chose you,</q> and this is meant by <q>the prophecies that went before on you.</q> Listen to them, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> them.</p>
<p>And say; what do you charge? <q>That by them you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> a good warfare.</q> They chose you, that then for which they chose you do thou, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> a good warfare.</q> He named <q>a good warfare,</q> since there is a bad warfare, of which he says, <q>As you have yielded your members instruments to uncleanness and to iniquity.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:19</font></u></a></span> Those men serve under a tyrant, but you serve under a King. And why calls he it a warfare? To show how mighty a contest is to be maintained by all, but especially by a Teacher; that we require strong arms, and sobriety, and awakenedness, and continual vigilance: that we must prepare ourselves for blood and conflicts, must be in battle array, and have nothing relaxed. <q>That you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> in them,</q> he says. For as in an army all do not serve in the same capacity, but in their different stations; so also in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> one has the office of a Teacher, another that of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, another that of a private man. But you are in this. And, because this is not sufficient he adds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 19</font></u></a>. <q>Holding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>For he that would be a Teacher must first teach himself. For as he who has not first been a good soldier, will never be a general, so it is with the Teacher; wherefore he says elsewhere, <q>Lest when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co009.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 9:27</font></u></a></span> <q>Holding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>and a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>,</q> that so you may preside over others. When we hear this, let us not disdain the exhortations of our superiors, though we be Teachers. For if Timothy, to whom all of us together are not worthy to be compared, receives commands and is instructed, and that being himself in the Teacher's office, much more should we. <q>Which some having put away, have made shipwreck concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> And this follows naturally. For when the life is corrupt, it engenders a doctrine congenial to it, and from this circumstance many are seen to fall into a gulf of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and to turn aside into Heathenism. For that they may not be tormented with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of futurity, they endeavor to persuade their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, that what we preach is false. And some turn aside from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, who seek out everything by reasoning; for reasoning produces shipwreck, while <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is as a safe ship.</p>
<p>They then who turn aside from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> must suffer shipwreck; and this he shows by an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 20</font></u></a>. <q>Of whom are Hymenæus and Alexander.</q></p>
<p>And from them he would instruct us. You see how even from those times there have been seducing Teachers, curious enquirers, and men holding off from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and searching out by their own reasonings. As the shipwrecked man is naked and destitute of all things, so is he that falls away from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> without resource, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not where to stand or where to stay himself, nor has he the advantage of a good life so as to gain anything from that quarter. For when the head is disordered, what avails the rest of the body? And if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> without a good life is unavailing, much more is the converse <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>. If God despises His own for our sakes, much more ought we to despise our own for His sake. For so it is, where any one falls away from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, he has no steadiness, he swims this way and that, till at last he is lost in the deep.</p>
<p><q>Whom I delivered to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>, that they might be taught not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a>!</q> Thus it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> to search into divine things by our own reasonings. For what have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> reasonings in common with them? But how does <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> instruct them not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a>? Can he instruct others, who has not yet taught himself, but is a blasphemer still? It is not that <q>he should instruct,</q> but <em>that they should be instructed</em>. It is not he that does it, though such is the result. As elsewhere he says in the case of the fornicator: <q>To deliver such an one to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> for the destruction of the flesh.</q> Not that he may save the body, but <q>that the spirit may be saved.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co005.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 5:5</font></u></a></span> Therefore it is spoken impersonally. How then is this effected? As executioners, though themselves laden with numberless crimes, are made the correctors of others; so it is here with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spirit. But why did you not punish them yourself, as you did that Bar-Jesus, and as Peter did Ananias, instead of delivering them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>? It was not that they might be punished, but that they might be instructed. For that he had the power appears from other passages, <q>What will you? Shall I come unto you with a rod?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:21</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Lest I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co013.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 13:10</font></u></a></span> Why did he then call upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> to punish them? That the disgrace might be greater, as the severity and the punishment was more striking. Or rather, they themselves chastised those who did not yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, but those who turned aside, they delivered to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>. Why then did Peter punish Ananias? Because while he was tempting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, he was still an unbeliever. That the unbelieving therefore might learn that they could not escape, they themselves inflicted punishment upon them; but those who had learned this, yet afterwards turned aside, they delivered to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>; showing that they were sustained not by their own power, but by their care for them; and as many as were lifted up into arrogance were delivered to him. For as kings with their own hands slay their enemies, but deliver their subjects to executioners for punishment, so it is in this case. And these acts were done to show the authority committed to the Apostles. Nor was it a slight power, to be able thus to subject the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> to their commands. For this shows that he served and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> them even against his will, and this was no little <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. And listen how he delivered them: <q>When you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to deliver such an one unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 5:4</font></u></a></span> He was then immediately expelled from the common assembly, he was separated from the fold, he became deserted and destitute; he was delivered to the wolf. For as the cloud designated the camp of the Hebrews, so the Spirit distinguished the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. If any one therefore was without, he was consumed, and it was by the judgment of the Apostles that he was cast out of the pale. So also the Lord delivered Judas to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>. For immediately <q>after the sop <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> entered into him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh013.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 13:27</font></u></a></span> Or this may be said; that those whom they wished to amend, they did not themselves punish, but reserved their punishments for those who were incorrigible. Or otherwise, that they were the more dreaded for delivering them up to others. Job also was delivered to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>, but not for his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, but for fuller <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of his worth.</p>
<p>Many such instances still occur. For since the Priests cannot <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> who are sinners, and unworthy partakers of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> Mysteries, God often in this way delivers them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>. For when diseases, and attacks, and sorrows, and calamities, and the like occur, it is on this account that they are inflicted. This is shown by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. <q>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:30</font></u></a></span> But how? Says one, when we approach but once a year! But this is indeed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, that you determine the worthiness of your approach, not by the purity of your minds, but by the interval of time. You think it a proper caution not to communicate often; not considering that you are seared by partaking unworthily, though only once, but to receive worthily, though often, is salutary. It is not presumptuous to receive often, but to receive unworthily, though but once in a whole life. But we are so miserably foolish, that, though we commit numberless offenses in the course of a year, we are not anxious to be absolved from them, but are satisfied, that we do not often make bold impudently to insult the Body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, not remembering that those who crucified Christ, crucified Him but once. Is the offense then the less, because committed but once? Judas betrayed his Master but once. What then, did that exempt him from punishment? Why indeed is time to be considered in this matter? Let our time of coming be when our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> is pure. The Mystery at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Easter</font></u></a> is not of more efficacy than that which is now celebrated. It is one and the same. There is the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, it is always a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11512b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Passover</font></u></a>. You who are initiated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this. On the Preparation, on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, on the Lord's day, and on the day of Martyrs, it is the same Sacrifice that is performed. <q>For as often,</q> he says, <q>as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:26</font></u></a></span> No time is limited for the performance of this Sacrifice, why then is it then called the Paschal feast? Because Christ suffered for us then. Let not the time, therefore, make any difference in your approach. There is at all times the same power, the same dignity, the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, one and the same body; nor is one celebration of it more or less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> than another. And this you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, who see upon these occasions nothing new, save these worldly veils, and a more splendid attendance. The only thing that these days have more is that from them commenced the day of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> when Christ was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>. But with respect to these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, those days have no further preëminence.</p>
<p>When you approach to take bodily food, you wash your hands and your mouth, but when you draw near to this spiritual food, you do not cleanse your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, but approach full of uncleanness. But you say, Are not the forty days' <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fastings</font></u></a> sufficient to cleanse the huge heap of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>? But of what use is it, tell me? If wishing to store up some precious ointment, you should make clean a place to receive it, and a little after having laid it up, should throw dung upon it, would not the fine odor vanish? This takes place with us too. We make ourselves to the best of our power worthy to approach; then we defile ourselves again! What then is the good of it? This we say even of those who are able in those forty days to wash themselves clean.</p>
<p>Let us then, I beseech you, not neglect our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, that our labor may not be in vain. For he who turns from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and goes and commits the same again, is <q>like a dog that returns to his vomit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro026.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 26:11</font></u></a></span> But if we act as we ought, and take heed to our ways, we shall be thought worthy of those high rewards, which that we may all obtain, God grant through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with whom, etc.</p>

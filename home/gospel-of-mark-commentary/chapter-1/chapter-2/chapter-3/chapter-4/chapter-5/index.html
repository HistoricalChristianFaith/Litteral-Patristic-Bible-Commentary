<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">2. And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">3. Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">4. Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">5. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">6. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">7. And cried with a loud voice, and said, “What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that Thou torment me not.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">8. For He said unto him, “Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">9. And He asked him, “What is thy name?” And he answered, saying, “My name is Legion: for we are many.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">10. And he besought Him much that He would not send them away out of the country. [p. 90]</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">11. Now there was nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">12. And all the devils besought Him, saying, “Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">13. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">14. And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">15. And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">16. And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">17. And they began to pray Him to depart out of their coasts.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">18. And when He was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed Him that he might be with Him.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">19. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, “Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">20. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Those who were in the ship enquired among themselves, “What manner of man is this?” and now it is made known Who He is by the testimony of His enemies. For the demoniac came up confessing that He was the Son of God. [p. 91] Proceeding to which circumstance the Evangelist says, “And they came over unto the other side, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>, in Marc., 2, 21: Geraza is a noted town of Arabia, across the Jordan, near mount Galaad, which the tribe of Manasseh held, not far from the lake of Tiberias, into which the swine were precipitated.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Nevertheless the exact reading contains neither Gadarenes, nor Gerasines, but Gergesenes. For Gadara is a city of Judaea, which has no sea at all about it; and Geraza is a city of Arabia, having neither lake nor sea near it. And that the Evangelists may not be thought to have spoken so manifest a falsehood, well acquainted as they were with the parts around Judaea, Gergese, from which come the Gergesenes, was an ancient city, now called Tiberias, around which is situated a considerable lake. [ed. note: Reland seems to feel the same difficulty about Gadara as the author of this comment; but he reconciles it by saying that the whole region might have been so called from the town of Gadara in Peroea, though the town itself was not on the lake. Reland, Palace., v2, p774, also Lightfoot, Horae Hebr. in locum.]</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It continues, “And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Augustine</span>, de Con. Evan., 2, 24: Though Matthew says that there were two, Mark and Luke mention one, that you may understand that one of them was a more illustrious person, concerning whose state that country was much afflicted.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Hom. in Matthew, 28: Or else, Mark and Luke relate what was most worthy of compassion, and for this reason they put down more at length what had happened to this man; for there follows, “no man could bind him, no, not with chains.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">They therefore simply said, a “man possessed of a devil,” without taking heed to the number; or else, that he might shew the greater virtue in the Worker; for He who had cured one such, might cure many others. Nor is there any discrepancy shewn here, for they did not say that there was one alone, for then they would have contradicted Matthew.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Now devils dwelt in tombs, wishing to convey a false opinion to many, that the souls of the dead were changed to devils.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Greg</span>. Nyss.: Now the assembly of the devils had prepared itself to resist the Divine power. But when He was approaching Who had power over all things, they proclaim aloud His eminent virtue.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore there follows, “But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, saying, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Cyril</span>: See how the devil is divided between to passions, fear and audacity; he hangs back and prays, as [p. 92] if meditating a question; he wishes to know what he had to do with Jesus, as though he would say, “Do you cast me out from men, who are mine?”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: And how great is the impiety of the Jews, to say that He cast out devils by the prince of the devils, when the very devils confess that they have nothing in common with Him.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., and <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Hom. in Matt., 28: Then praying to Him, he subjoins, “I adjure thee by God, that Thou torment me not.” For he considered being cast out to be a torment, or else he was also invisibly tortured. For however bad the devils are, they know that there awaits them at last a punishment for their sins; but that the time of their last punishment was not yet come, they full well knew, especially as they were permitted to mix among men. But because Christ had come upon them as they were doing such dreadful deeds, they thought that such was the heinousness of their crimes, He would not wait for the last times, to punish them; for this reason they beg that they may not be tormented.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: For it is a great torment for a devil to cease to hurt a man, and the more severely he possesses him, the more reluctantly he lets him go.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">For it goes on, “For He said unto Him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Cyril</span>: Consider the unconquerable power of Christ; He makes Satan shake, for to him the words of Christ are fire and flame: as the Psalmist says, “The mountains melted at the presence of the Lord, [Ps 97:5] that is, great and proud powers.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">There follows, “And He asked him, What is thy name?”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: The Lord indeed asks, not that He Himself required to know, but that the rest might know that there was a multitude of devils dwelling in him.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Lest he should not be believed, if He affirmed there were many, He wishes that they themselves should confess it; wherefore there follows, “And he saith unto Him, Legion, for we are many.” He gives not a fixed number, but a multitude, for such accuracy in the number would not help us to understand it.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: But by the public declaration of the scourge which the madman suffered the virtue of the Healer appears more gracious. And even the priests of our time, who know how to cast out devils by the grace of exorcism, are wont to say that the sufferers cannot be cured at all, unless they in confession openly declare, as far as they are able to know, what they have suffered from the unclean spirits in sight, in hearing, in taste, in touch, or [p. 93] any other sense of body or soul, whether awake or asleep.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And he besought Him much that He would not send them away out of the country.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Luke, however, says, “into the abyss.” [Luke 8:3] For the abyss is the separation of this world, for devils deserve to be sent into outer darkness, prepared for the devil and his angels. This Christ might have done, but He allowed them to remain in this world, lest the absence of a tempter should deprive men of the crown of victory.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Also that by fighting with us, they may make us more expert.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “Now there was there about the mountain a great herd of swine feeding.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Augustine</span>, de Con. Evan, ii, 24: What Mark here says, that the herd was about the mountain, and what Luke calls on the mountain, are by no means inconsistent. For the herd of swine was so large, that some part were on the mountain, the rest around it.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on: “And the devils besought Him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Remig</span>., see Aurea Catena in Matt., p.327: The devils entered not into the swine of their own will, but their asking for this concession was that is might be shewn that they cannot hurt men without Divine permission. They did not ask to be sent into men, because they saw that He, by whose power they were tortured, bore a human form. Nor did they desire to be sent into the flocks, for they are clean animals offered up in the temple of God. But they desired to be sent into the swine, because no animal is more unclean than a hog, and devils always delight in filthiness.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on: “And forthwith Jesus gave them leave.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: And He gave them leave, that by the killing of the swine, the salvation of men might be furthered.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Pseudo-Chyrs., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He wished to shew publicly the fury which devils entertain against men, and that they would inflict much worse things upon men, if they were not hindered by Divine power; because, again, His compassion would not allow this to be shewn on men, He permitted them to enter into the swine, that on them the fury and power of the devils might be made known.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">There follows: “And the unclean spirits went out.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Titus: But the herdsmen also took to flight, lest they should perish with the swine, and spread the same fear amongst the inhabitants of the town.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore there follows: “And they that fed them, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">The necessity of their loss, however, brought these men to the Saviour; for [p. 94] frequently when God makes men suffer loss in their possessions, He confers a benefit on their souls.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it goes on: “And they came to Jesus, and see him that was tormented by the devil, &amp;c.” that is, at the feet of Him from whom he had obtained health; a man, whom before, not even chains could bind, clothed and in his right mind, though he used to be continually naked; and they were amazed.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it says, “And they were afraid.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">This miracle then they find out partly by sight, partly by words.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore there follows: “And they that saw it told them.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: But amazed at the miracle, which they had heard, they were afraid, and for this reason they beseech Him to depart out of their borders; which is expressed in what follows: “And they began to pray Him to depart out of their coasts;” for they feared lest some time or other they should suffer a like thing: for, saddened at the loss of their swine, they reject the presence of the Saviour.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Or else, conscious of their own frailty, they judged themselves unworthy of the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on: “And when He was going to the ship, he that had been tormented, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: For he feared lest some time or other the devils should find him, and enter into him a second time. But the Lord sends him back to his house, intimating to him, that though He Himself was not present, yet His power would keep him; at the same time also that he might be of use in the healing of others.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it goes on: “And He did not suffer him, and saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">See the humility of the Saviour. He said not, ‘Proclaim all things which I have done to you,’ but, all that the Lord hath done; do thou also, when thou hast done any good thing, take it not to thyself, but refer it to God.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>.: But although He bade others, whom He healed, to tell it to no one, He nevertheless fitly bids this one proclaim it, since all that region, being possessed by devils, remained without God.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: He therefore began to proclaim it, and all wonder, which, is that which follows: “And he began to publish.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Mystically, however, Gerasa or Gergese, as some read it, is interpreted casting out a dweller or a stranger approaching, because the people of the Gentiles both expelled the enemy from the heart, and he who was afar off is made near.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span>: Here again the demoniac is the people of the Gentiles, in a most hopeless case, bound neither by the [p. 95] law of nature, nor of God, nor by human fear.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Who dwelt in the tombs, because they delighted in dead works, that is, in sins; who were ever raging night and day, because whether in prosperity or in adversity, they were never free from the service of malignant spirits: again, by the foulness of their works, they lay as it were in the tombs, in their lofty pride, they wandered over the mountains, by words of most hardened infidelity, they as it were cut themselves with stones.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">But he said, “My name is Legion,” because the Gentile people were enslaved to divers idolatrous forms of worship. Again, that the unclean spirits going out from man enter into swine, which they cast headlong into the sea, implies that now that the people of the Gentiles are freed from the empire of demons, they who have not chosen to believe in Christ, work sacrilegious rites in hidden places.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Or by this it is signified that devils enter into those men who live like swine, rolling themselves in the slough of pleasure; they drive them headlong into the sea down the precipice of perdition, into the sea of an evil life where they are choked.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span>: Or they are choked in hell without any touch of mercy by the rushing on of an early death; which evils many persons thus avoid, for by the scourging of the fool, the wise is made more prudent.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: But that the Lord did not admit him, though he wished to be with Him, signifies, that every one after the remission of his sins should remember that he must work to obtain a good conscience, and serve the Gospel for the salvation of others, that at last he may rest in Christ.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Greg</span>., Mor., 37: For when we have perceived ever so little of the Divine knowledge, we are at once unwilling to return to human affairs, and seek for the quiet of contemplation; but the Lord commands that the mind should first toil hard at its work, and afterwards should refresh itself with contemplation.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span>: But the man who is healed preached in Decapolis, where the Jews, who hang on the letter of the Decalogue, are being turned away from the Roman rule.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">22. And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet,</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">23. And besought Him greatly, saying, “My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay Thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">24. And Jesus went with him; and much people followed Him, and thronged Him.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">25. And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">26. And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">27. When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched His garment.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">28. For she said, “If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">29. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">30. And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that virtue had gone out of Him, turned Him about in the press, and said, “Who touched My clothes?”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">31. And His disciples said unto Him, “Thou seest the multitude thronging Thee, and saying Thou, ‘Who touched Me?’ “</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">33. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before Him, and told Him all the truth.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">[p. 97]</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: After the miracle of the demoniac, the Lord works another miracle, namely, in raising up the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue; the Evangelist, before narrating this miracle, says, “And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto Him.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Augustine</span>, de Con. Evan., 2, 28: But we must understand, that what is added of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, took place when Jesus had again crossed the sea in a ship, though how long after does not appear; for if there were not an interval, there could be no time for the taking place of that which Matthew relates, concerning the feast at his own house; after which event, nothing follows immediately, except this concerning the daughter of the chief of the synagogue. For he has so put it together, that the transition itself shews that the narrative follows the order of time.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “There cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He has recorded the name on account of the Jews of that time, that it might mark the miracle.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet, and besought Him greatly, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Matthew indeed relates that the chief of the synagogue reported that his daughter was dead, but Mark says that she was very sick, and that afterwards it was told to the ruler of the synagogue, when our Lord was about to go with him, that she was dead. The fact then, which Matthew implies, is the same, namely, that He raised her from the dead; and it is for the sake of brevity, that he says that she was dead, which was evident from her being raised.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Augustine</span>: For he attaches himself not to the words of the father, but to what is of most importance, his wishes; for he was in such despair, that his wish was that she should return to life, not thinking that she could be found alive, whom he had left dying.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Now this man was faithful in part, inasmuch as he fell at the feet of Jesus, but in that he begged of Him to come, he did not shew as much faith as he ought. For he ought to have said, ‘Speak the word only, and my daughter shall be healed.’</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">There follows, “And He went away with him, and much people followed Him, and thronged Him; and a woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., see <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Hom. in Matt., 31: This woman, who was celebrated and known to all, did not dare to approach the Saviour openly, nor to [p. 98] come to Him, because, according to the law, she was unclean; for this reason she touched Him behind, and not in front, for that she durst not do, but only ventured to touch the hem of His garment. It was not however the hem of the garment, but her frame of mind that made her whole.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">There follows, “For she said, “If I may but touch His clothes, I shall be whole.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Most faithful indeed is this woman, who hoped for healing from His garments. For which reason she obtains health.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it goes on, “And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now the virtues of Christ are by His own will imparted to those men, who touch Him by faith.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore there follows, “And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that virtue had gone out of Him, turned Him about in the press, and said, Who touched My clothes?” The virtues indeed of the Saviour do not go out of Him locally or corporally, nor in any respect pass away from Him. For being incorporeal, they go forth to others and are given to others; they are not however separated from Him, from whom they are said to go forth, in the same way as sciences are given by the teacher to his pupils.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Therefore it says, “Jesus, knowing in Himself the virtue which had gone out of Him,” to shew that with His knowledge, and not without His being aware of it, the woman was healed. But He asked, “Who touched me?” although He knew her who touched Him, that He might bring to light the woman, by her coming forward, and proclaim her faith, and lest the virtue of His miraculous work should be consigned to oblivion.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And His disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched Me?”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">But the Lord asked, “Who touched Me,” that is in thought and faith, for the crowds who throng Me cannot be said to touch Me, for they do not come near to Me in thought and in faith.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">There follows, “And He looked round about to see her that had done this thing.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: For the Lord wished to declare the woman, first to give His approbation to her faith, secondly to urge the chief of the synagogue to a confident hope that He could thus cure his child, and also to free the woman from fear. For the woman feared because she had stolen health.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore there follows, “But the woman fearing [p. 99] and trembling, &amp;c.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>, in Marc., 2, 22: Observe that the object of His question was that the woman should confess the truth of her long want of faith, of her sudden belief and healing, and so herself be confirmed in faith, and afford an example to others.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">“But He said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">He said not, Thy faith is about to make thee whole, but has made thee whole, that is, in that thou hast believed, thou hast already been made whole.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Hom. in Matt., 31: He calls her “daughter” because she was saved by her faith; for faith in Christ makes us His children.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: But He saith to her, “Go in peace,” that is, in rest, which means, go and have rest, for up to this time thou hast been in pains and torture.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>.: Or else He says, “Go in peace,” sending her away into that which is the final good, for God dwells in peace, that thou mayest know, that she was not only healed in body, but also from the causes of bodily pain, that is, from her sins.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span>: Mystically, however, Jairus comes after the healing of the woman, because when the fulness of the Gentiles has come in, then shall Israel be saved. [Romans 11] Jairus means either illuminating, or illuminated, that is, the Jewish people, having cast off the shadow of the letter, enlightened by the Spirit, and enlightening others, falling at the feet of the Word, that is, humbling itself before the Incarnation of Christ, prays for her daughter, for when a man lives himself, he makes others live also. Thus Abraham, and Moses, and Samuel, intercede for the people who are dead, and Jesus comes upon their prayers.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Again, the Lord going to the child, who is to be healed, is thronged by the crowd, because though He gave healthful advice to the Jewish nation, He is oppressed by the wicked habits of that carnal people; but the woman with an issue of blood, cured by the Lord, is the Church gathered together from the nations, for the issue of blood may be either understood of the pollution of idolatry, or of those deeds, which are accompanied by pleasure to flesh and blood. But whilst the word of the Lord decreed salvation to Judaea, the people of the Gentiles by an assured hope seized upon the health, promised and prepared for others.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Or else, by the woman, who had a bloody flux, understand human nature; for sin rushed in upon it, which [p. 100] since it killed the soul, might be said to spill its blood. It could not be cured by many physicians, that is, by the wise men of this world, and of the Law and the Prophets; but the moment that it touched the hem of Christ’s garment, that is, His flesh, it was healed, for whosoever believes the Son of man to be Incarnate is he who touches the hem of His garment.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Wherefore one believing woman touches the Lord, whilst the crowd throngs Him, because He, who is grieved by divers heresies, or by wicked habits, is worshipped faithfully with the heart of the Catholic Church alone. But the Church of the Gentiles came behind Him; because though it did not see the Lord present in the flesh, for the mysteries of His Incarnation had been gone through, yet it attained to the grace of His faith, and so when by partaking of His sacraments, it merited salvation from its sins, as it were the fountain of its blood was dried up by the touch of His garments. And the Lord looked round about to see her who had done this, because He judges that all who deserve to be saved are worthy of His look and of His pity.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">35. While He yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain which said, “Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">36. As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, “Be not afraid, only believe.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">37. And He suffered no man to follow Him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">38. And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">39. And when He was come in, He saith unto them, “Why make ye this ado, and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.”</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">40. And they laughed Him to scorn. But when He had put them all out, He taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with Him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. [p. 101]</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">41. And He took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, “Talitha cumi;” which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">42. And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:red">43. And He charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: Those who were about the ruler of the synagogue, thought that Christ was one of the prophets, and for this reason they thought that they should beg of Him to come and pray over the damsel. But because she had already expired, they thought that He ought not to be asked to do so.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Therefore it is said, “While He yet spake, there came messengers to the ruler of the synagogue, which said, Thy daughter is dead; why troublest thou the Master any further?”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">But the Lord Himself persuades the father to have confidence.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">For it goes on, “As soon as Jesus heard the word which was spoken, He saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid; only believe.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Augustine</span>: It is not said that he assented to his friends who brought the tidings and wished to prevent the Master from coming, so that our Lord’s saying, “Fear not, only believe,” is not a rebuke for his want of faith, but was intended to strengthen the belief which he had already. But if the Evangelist had related, that the ruler of the synagogue joined the friends who came from his house, in saying that Jesus should not be troubled, the words which Matthew relates him to have said, namely, that the damsel was dead, would then have been contrary to what was in his mind.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And He suffered no man to follow Him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: For Christ in His lowliness would not do any thing for display.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span>., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But He Himself commands them not to wail, as if the damsel was not dead, [p. 102] but sleeping.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it says, “And when He was come in, He saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span>: It was told the ruler of the synagogue, Thy daughter is dead. But Jesus said to him, She is not dead, but sleepeth. Bother are true, for the meaning is, She is dead to you, but to Me she is asleep.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: For to men she was dead, who were unable to raise her up; but to God she was asleep, in whose purpose both the soul was living, and the flesh was resting, to rise again. Whence it became a custom amongst Christians, that the dead, who, they doubt not, will rise again, should be said to sleep.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “And they laughed Him to scorn.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Theophylact</span>: But they laugh at Him, as if unable to do any thing farther; and in this He convicts them of bearing witness involuntarily, that she was really dead whom He raised up, and therefore, that it would be a miracle if He raised her.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Because they chose rather to laugh at than to believe in this saying concerning her resurrection, they are deservedly excluded from the place, as unworthy to witness His power in raising her, and the mystery of her rising.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it goes on, “But when He had put them all out, He taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with Him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>.: Or else, to take away all display, He suffered not all to be with Him; that, however, He might leave behind Him witnesses of His divine power, He chose His three chief disciples and the father and mother of the damsel, as being necessary above all. And He restores life to the damsel both by His hand, and by word of mouth.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it says, “And He took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">For the hand of Jesus, having a quickening power, quickens the dead body, and His voice raises her as she is lying.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it follows, “And straightway the damsel arose and walked.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Jerome</span>, Hier. ad Pam., Ep. 57: Some one may accuse the Evangelist of a falsehood in his explanation, in that he had added, “I say unto thee,” when in Hebrew, “Talitha cumi” only means, “Damsel, arise;” but He adds, “I say unto thee, Arise,” to express that His meaning was to call and command her.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It goes on, “For she was of the age of twelve years.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:purple">Gloss</span>.: The Evangelist added this, [p. 103] to shew that she was of an age to walk. By her walking, she is shewn to have been not only raised up, but also perfectly cured.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">It continues, “And they were astonished with a great astonishment.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Chrys</span>., Hom. in Matt., 81: To shew that He had raised her really, and not only to the eye of fancy.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: Mystically; the woman was cured of a bloody flux, and immediately after the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue is reported to be dead, because as soon as the Church of the Gentiles is washed from the stain of vice, and called daughter by the merits of her faith, at once the synagogue is broken up on account of its zealous treachery and envy; treachery, because it did not choose to believe in Christ; envy, because it was vexed at the faith of the Church.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">What the messengers told the ruler of the synagogue, “Why troublest thou the Master any more,” is said by those in this day who, seeing the state of the synagogue, deserted by God, believe that it cannot be restored, and therefore think that we are not to pray that it should be restored. But if the ruler of the synagogue, that is, the assembly of the teachers of the Law, determine to believe, the synagogue also, which is subjected to them, will be saved.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Further, because the synagogue lost the joy of having Christ to dwell in it, as its faithlessness deserved, it lies dead as it were, amongst persons weeping and wailing. Again, our Lord raised the damsel by taking hold of her hand, because the hands of the Jews, which are full of blood, must first be cleansed, else the synagogue, which is dead, cannot rise again. But in the woman with the bloody flux, and the raising of the damsel, is shewn the salvation of the human race, which was so ordered by the Lord, that first some from Judaea, then the fulness of the Gentiles, might come in, and so all Israel might be saved. Again, the damsel was twelve years old, and the woman had suffered for twelve years, because the sinning of unbelievers was contemporary with the beginning of the faith of believers.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Wherefore it is said, “Abraham believed on God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.” [Gen 15:6]</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">[ed. note: <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>’s own words are rather more clear than those in the Catena: “That is, the woman began to be afflicted at the same time as the damsel was born; for nearly at the same period of the world the synagogue began to arise amongst the patriarchs, and the race of Gentiles throughout the world to be polluted with idolatry.”]</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">[p. 104]</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Greg</span>., Mor. 4, 27: Morally again, our Redeemer raised the damsel in the house, the young man without the gate, Lazarus in the tomb; he still lies dead in the house, whose sin is concealed; he is carried without the gate, whose sin has broken forth into the madness of an open deed; he lies crushed under the mound of the tomb, who in the commission of sin, lies powerless beneath the weight of habit.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm"><span style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;COLOR:blue">Bede</span>: And we may remark, that lighter and daily errors may be cured by the remedy of a lighter penance. Wherefore the Lord raises the damsel, lying in the inner chamber with a very easy cry, saying, “Damsel, arise;” but that he who had been four days dead might quit the prison of the tomb, He groaned in spirit, He was troubled, He shed tears. In proportion, then, as the death of the soul presses the more heavily, so much the more ardently must the fervour of the penitent press forward.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">But this too must be observed, that a public crime requires a public reparation; wherefore Lazarus, when called from the sepulchre, was placed before the eyes of the people: but slight sins require to be washed out by a secret penance, wherefore the damsel lying in the house is raised up before few witnesses, and those are desired to tell no man.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">The crowd also is cast out before the damsel is raised; for if a crowd of worldly thoughts be not first cast out from the hidden parts of the heart, the soul, which lies dead within, cannot rise.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify;MARGIN:3pt 0cm">Well too did she arise and walk, for the soul, raised from sin, ought not only to rise from the filth of its crimes, but also to make advances in good works, and soon it is necessary that it should be filled with heavenly bread, that is, made partaker of the Divine Word, and of the Altar.</p></div>

Tobit because it contains his story. He was a man from the tribe of Naphtali,
held in captivity in Nineveh, merciful and fearing God. For, when he was in
captivity, he did not eat bread in common with the Gentiles, but he guarded
himself. He was superintendent of the markets for king Shalmaneser, and he
deposited ten talents of silver at Gabelus's in Media. This Tobit devoted
himself to burying the dead Jews. He was denounced to king Sennacherib for
this, and fled to save himself. When he was back from his flight, after burying
a few dead, he fell asleep outside the walls of his house, and while, as was
his habit, he kept his eyes open in his sleep, he contracted a white film over
them, and from that time he lost sight. There was in Ecbatana the daughter of
Raguel, a relative of Tobit's, called Sara. The devil Asmodeus would not let
her enter into any marriage. For he had already killed seven young men who had
taken her as a bride. When, strongly saddened by this, she gave herself over to
prayers, God sent the archangel Raphael to help her. So, Tobit, having
commanded his son Tobias not to take a wife from elsewhere than from his own
tribe and family, gave him the note concerning the ten talents, and told him to
go and ask for them. As the son knew neither the way nor the man to whom he had
to go, he went out to seek a guide for his journey, and, by God's providence,
he stumbled upon Raphael, who stood outside in the appearance of a man, and he
hired him for a price, because he said he knew the way. Therefore the angel
accompanied him, in man's disguise, saying his name was Azarias. When they
reached the waters of the Tigris, Tobias wanted to go down into them to wash
himself, and soon a large fish attacked him. The angel ordered him to catch the
fish, cut it into pieces, take out the liver, heart, and gall, and keep them.
When, later, the boy asked what he thought they would be useful for, he
replied: "The liver and heart, when set on fire, put demons to flight; and
the gall removes white films from the eyes." Therefore, thanks to the
advice and assistance of the angel, Tobias put the demon to flight with the
smoke, and made the angel bind him in the upper part of Egypt; and so he took
Sara, Raguel's daughter, as a wife. While he stayed with his wife, he sent
Azarias, as a man, to Media. When Tobias had gotten back the ten talents
through him, he returned to his father with him and his wife. Once he was back,
he smeared the fish's gall on his father's eyes; when that had been done,
scales fell off from them, and soon the old man recovered sight. He was 58
years old when he became blind, and 66 when he recovered sight. Then at last
the angel revealed that he was not a man, but an angel sent by God to bring
help to them and Sara. When Tobit became old, he ordered his son to depart for
Media, because Nineveh, according to what the prophet Jonah had said, was going
to be destroyed. And, his strength abandoning him, he died at the age of 158.
His son Tobias moved to Media, where, eventually, having buried his
father-in-law and mother-in-law, and heard the news of Nineveh’s destruction,
he died at the age of 107. </span></font><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Athanasius of Alexandria, Synop. On

Hagiographa. I have done enough for your desire, but not by my pursuit. For the
zeal of the Hebrews rebuke us and charge us, to translate this for the ears of
Latins against their canon. But it is better to be judging the judgment of the

practiced.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">I have persisted as I have

finding a speaker very skilled in both languages, I took to the work of one

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
prayer of the just man is the key to heaven. — 1. Blessed Tobias, who knew how
to break his bread for the hungry man, prepared to pay quickly the hired
servant for his work. After patiently listening to the reading that has just
been recited, we were wondering at the treatment of the father and of the son,
and at the way they were instructed by the angel, whom they believed to be an
earthly hired servant, under heavenly glory. In truth, Tobit was stricken with
the calamity of blindness in order to receive the angel as a physician, who,
kindled with divine firebrands, gasped, "Prayer is good with fasting and
alms" (Tob. 12:8). The prayer of the just man is the key to heaven. The
prayer ascends, and God's mercy descends. Although the earth is deep down and
heaven is high up, God hears the tongue of man, if his conscience is clean. He
talks with the senses, if there is but a sigh on our part. Rain from the eyes
is enough for his ears; he hears tears more quickly than words. The prayer of
the hater is always driven away from his ears. The soul of the father and of
the son was one; while either of them had his own limbs, they had a singular
union of minds.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">Son, says Tobit, let us
dismiss this man, adding something to the wages that were agreed on; because he
has brought us much good with his work (ibid. 1, etc.). And the son, after
recounting the treatment they had received from him, says to his father:
Father, can it possibly be right for so blessed a servant as this to be paid
only the wages that were agreed on, while his good guidance is inestimable? We
shall repay him with too little honor if we determine a measure for his
merits.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Did he himself provide only what
had been agreed on? What had been agreed on was that he should show me the
region and the man to whom you had entrusted the money. First, travelling as if
on a heavenly way, he prepared from the fish the eye salve that both you and I
needed; he guided me, got the money back, gave me Sara for a wife. Does he
deserve only the wages that were agreed on, while he was for me like a heavenly
bridesman, and, what is more, father, cured the spots on your eyes by removing
the film that covered them, and lit up our whole house by illuminating the
lamps of your eyes? I now see more clearly because I behold you seeing. My
excellent father, does he not deserve half of the goods? Let a guide and
provider such as this, such a physician and guardian, as he said, receive as
his share half of the goods that he has brought with me, since he has shown
such kindness to me in his guidance. The good father liked the response of his
wise son. He started asking the hired servant to take indeed his wages.
"My brother," he said, "take what is yours, and then go in
safety." Receive your wages, because you have shown good compassion to me
and my son. Take up, as I said, half of the goods you have brought back with my
son; for the gratitude we owe you cannot be measured.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2.
The angel, who had been sent to do a kindness for free, immediately rejoiced at
the wages they had thought about. Tobit, said he, or Tobias, why are you
thinking, rather superfluously, about my wages? Keep what the heavenly Father
has granted you. I am the instrument of healing, he is the maker of health. You
do not know what sort of servant it is whose help you have earned the enjoyment
of. You were not afraid to bury those who had died in captivity, Tobit: your
works ascended to the Lord, because you left your dinner to lay a dead man to
rest. I brought rich sacrifices to the Lord on account of this respectable
burial; I was sent as a laborer of the heavenly market.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">The two of you buried a dead man, and were
not afraid of the sting of death. The buried man himself clamored in your
defense with a silent voice. The blindness of your eyes served as a test, for
your patience to earn a brighter decoration from heaven. "I am Raphael,
one of the seven angels who stand before the glory of the Lord" (Ibid.
15). I do not need the enjoyment of human wages: I am made rich by dwelling
with his majesty. The one who sent me is rich; he ordered things to be expended
for free, as he himself granted them for free. Do not even bestow on me the
honor of thanks, because you have received nothing through my power.
"Bless God, and give thanks to him, and glorify him, because he has done
good things among you." (Ibid. 6, 18).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3.
Upon the sudden revelation of the honor of the heavenly mystery, stunned by the
voice of the angel Raphael, Tobit and Tobias fell down onto the ground and
altogether hid their trembling voices, because they had heard a strange voice.
What did you earn, father Tobit and son Tobias? To have a heavenly servant, and
hire him as an earthly laborer? </font><a name="_Hlk478898040"><font color="#000000" size="3">The angel concealed his
name from you. "I am Azarias," he said, "the son of the great
Ananias" (Tob. 5:18), and he did not say, "I am the angel
Raphael." With the first name, he concealed his dignity, so as not to
cause fright in his hirer. For if he had said, "I am an angel", he
would not have been Tobias's hired servant. The dignity of the name was
reserved, so that the magnitude of the dignity might become clear in the end. </font></a><font size="3">See,
my dearest, how great the merit of almsdeed is: he earned the privilege of
having an angel as a laborer. You see how beneficial it is to bury the dead: it
made his offering ascend to the heavenly majesty through the angel Raphael. You
see that alms delivers from death, and the same purges away sins. It performs
the purgation of the eyes; it delivers from the darkness of sins. Tobias is
guided on his way, and Sara, saddened by the loss of so many men, is married
thanks to the angel. </font></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Augustine of Hippo, Sermon 226, on the

Testaments: Tobit</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
providence of the Lord God towards us is so great that, not wanting us to err,
he gave us the law and examples of good works, so that, following them, one may
lead an honest and peaceful life with the fear of God. For he who is the maker
of life naturally does not wish his work to be subject to death. Although
nature itself is not devoid of law, the Lord, being good and merciful, wanted
us to have greater knowledge of the things to be pursued and of the things to
be avoided, and to this end he showed them through texts and examples, as the
present reading attests. Therefore God's servant holy Tobit was given to us,
after the law, as an example, so that we may know how the things we have read
are done, and so that, if trials come, we may not desist from the fear of God,
and that we may not hope for help from any other source than from him, keeping
in mind that it is written, "I have been young, and now am old; and I have
not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread" (Ps. 36:25). Therefore
he who hopes in God with all his mind can never be deceived. Even if
tribulations arise for a time through Satan's maneuvers, the examples of holy
men teach us that these things are permitted by God only for the sake of increasing
our rewards; because if we bear tribulations with composure, we shall here be
given consolation with effect, and in the future we shall be given eternal life
with glory. For because our God is just and there is no respect of persons with
him (Rom. 2:11), he lets us be tested, because he loves us, so that he may give
us immense rewards after the hardship. Indeed, when the apostle was praying for
his trials to cease, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you;
for power is made perfect in infirmity". As a reaction to this the apostle
said, "When I am weak, then am I stronger", and "I rejoice in my
tribulations," he said, "that the power of Christ may dwell in
me" (2 Cor. 12:9-10). So, let us be informed by the Scripture of how
praiseworthy holy Tobit is, whose devotion captivity did not diminish, whom the
loss of his eyes did not stop from blessing God, whom the exhaustion of his
resources did not divert from the way of justice and truth (Tob. 1-3). Indeed,
need tests a just man and proves him to be just, and keeping fairness when in
poverty is the true and perfect justice. From things that diminish the devotion
of some, praiseworthy Tobit gained an increase of it. For want, he says,
humiliates a man, and he who is humiliated cannot keep justice. But holy
Tobit's spirit, intent on God, was neither broken by captivity nor humiliated
by want, because he buried the bodies of the slain in spite of the prohibition,
and, certain of God's generosity, he was compassionate even with the small
means that he had, knowing that God prefers the compassion that is done from
small means, as did the widow whom the Lord praised in the Gospel (Luke
21:2-4). For the truly faithful person, the person who does not doubt God's
promises, is the one who gives generously from little. Therefore, comforting his
heart with the hope of the future, Tobit, devoted to God, was found to be
strong and brave in trial, showing that, when in want, one ought to be all the
more vigilant in God's fear, because if want does not prompt you to seek God's
help, how much less will security? Therefore holy men, certain that God has
reserved for himself the judgement of all that is done in this world, not only
have not been vexed about tribulations, losses, and other calamities or
reproaches, but they have even accepted them with gratitude, as did our
apostles, who after being beaten rejoiced that they had been accounted worthy
to suffer reproach for the name of Christ (Acts 5:41). Indeed, the calamities
that unjustly strike the faithful, whether in tribulations or in reproaches, are
the signs of future rewards. Therefore just Tobit was so pleasing to God that
he obtained for his merits a twofold reward: for the present he recovered,
through the angel's agency, the sight that he had lost, and was also enriched
with the resources that are useful in this life; and for the future he was made
an heir of the kingdom of heaven: so that we might be taught through this that
when someone obeys God's law with all their heart and does not doubt his
promises, God often augments their resources in this world, and grants them
eternal life in the next. There is also something else that invites us to
compliance with God's law: holy Tobit did not only obtain the rewards of his
own justice, because there is added to the sum of his glory also something from
the good actions of those who behave as his imitators. For examples are praised
in their imitators. This can happen to us as well if we live in such a way that
it becomes appropriate for us to have imitators too.</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Ambrosiaster,

towards us is so great that, not wanting us to err, he gave us the law and
examples of good works, so that, following them, one may lead an honest and
peaceful life with the fear of God. For he who is the maker of life naturally
does not wish his work to be subject to death. Although nature itself is not
devoid of law, the Lord, being good and merciful, wanted us to have greater
knowledge of the things to be pursued and of the things to be avoided, and to
this end he showed them through texts and examples, as the present reading
attests. Therefore God's servant holy Tobit was given to us, after the law, as
an example, so that we may know how the things we have read are done, and so
that, if trials come, we may not desist from the fear of God, and that we may
not hope for help from any other source than from him, keeping in mind that it
is written, "I have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen the
just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread" (Ps. 36:25).</span></font><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Therefore, he who hopes in God with
all his mind can never be deceived. Even if tribulations arise for a time
through Satan's maneuvers, the examples of holy men teach us that these things
are permitted by God only for the sake of increasing our rewards; because if we
bear tribulations with composure, we shall here be given consolation with
effect, and in the future we shall be given eternal life with glory. For
because our God is just and there is no respect of persons with him (Rom.
2:11), he lets us be tested, because he loves us, so that he may give us
immense rewards after the hardship. Indeed, when the apostle was praying for
his trials to cease, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you;
for power is made perfect in infirmity". As a reaction to this the apostle
said, "When I am weak, then am I stronger", and "I rejoice in my
tribulations," he said, "that the power of Christ may dwell in
me" (2 Cor. 12:9-10). </font></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Augustine, Quaestiones Veteris et Novi

Scripture of how praiseworthy holy Tobit is, whose devotion captivity did not
diminish, whom the loss of his eyes did not stop from blessing God, whom the
exhaustion of his resources did not divert from the way of justice and truth
(Tob. 1-3). Indeed, need tests a just man and proves him to be just, and
keeping fairness when in poverty is the true and perfect justice. From things
that diminish the devotion of some, praiseworthy Tobit gained an increase of
it. For want, he says, humiliates a man, and he who is humiliated cannot keep
justice. But holy Tobit's spirit, intent on God, was neither broken by captivity
nor humiliated by want, because he buried the bodies of the slain in spite of
the prohibition, and, certain of God's generosity, he was compassionate even
with the small means that he had, knowing that God prefers the compassion that
is done from small means, as did the widow whom the Lord praised in the Gospel
(Lk. 21:2-4). Therefore holy men, certain that God has reserved for himself the
judgement of all that is done in this world, not only have not been vexed about
tribulations, losses, and other calamities or reproaches, but they have even
accepted them with gratitude, as did our apostles, who after being beaten
rejoiced that they had been accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of
Christ (Acts 5:41). Indeed, the calamities that unjustly strike the faithful,
whether in tribulations or in reproaches, are the signs of future rewards.
Therefore just Tobit was so pleasing to God that he obtained for his merits a
twofold reward: for the present he recovered, through the angel's agency, the
sight that he had lost, and was also enriched with the resources that are
useful in this life; and for the future he was made an heir of the kingdom of
heaven: so that we might be taught through this that when someone obeys God's
law with all their heart and does not doubt his promises, God often augments
their resources in this world, and grants them eternal life in the next. There
is also something else that invites us to compliance with God's law: holy Tobit
did not only obtain the rewards of his own justice, because there is added to
the sum of his glory also something from the good actions of those who behave
as his imitators. For examples are praised in their imitators. This can happen
to us as well if we live in such a way that it becomes appropriate for us to
have imitators too. </span></font><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Augustine, Quaestiones Veteris et Novi

his works, because it is written, ““Alms do deliver from death,” and not,

carried down into two precepts, since on the one hand it is said by a certain
righteous man, Do that to no man which you hate. (Tob. 4:15) And on the other
‘Truth’ says by Himself, Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to them. (Matt. 7:12) By which two precepts of
both Testaments, by the one an evil disposition is restrained, and by the other
a good disposition charged upon us, that every man not doing the ill which he
would not wish to suffer, should cease from the working of injuries, and again
that rendering the good which he desires to be done to him, he exert himself
for the service of his neighbor in kindness of heart.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">But while these same two are thought on with
heedful regard, the heart is made to open itself wide in innumerable offices of
virtue, lest whether for the admitting of things which it ought not, the mind
being agitated be heated by passions; or for the setting forth of whatsoever it
ought, being undone by indolence, it may be rendered inactive.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">For when it guards against doing to another
what it would not on any account itself undergo at the hands of another, it
looks about itself on every side with a heedful eye, lest pride lift it up, and
while cutting down set up the soul even to contempt of our neighbor; lest
coveting mangle the thought of the heart, and while stretching it wide to
desire the things of another, straightly confine it; lest lust pollute the
heart, and corrupt it, thus become the slave of its passions, in forbidden
courses; lest anger increase, and inflame it even to giving vent to insult;
lest envy gnaw it, and lest jealous of the successes of others it consume
itself with its own torch; lest loquacity drive on the tongue beyond all bounds
of moderation, and draw it out even to the extent of license in slander; lest
bad feeling stir up hatred, and set on the lips even to let loose the dart of
cursing.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Again, when it thinks how it
may do to another what it looks for at the hands of another for itself, it
considers how it may return good things for evil, and better things for good;
how to exhibit towards the impertinent the meekness of longsuffering; how to
render the kindness of good will to them that pine with the plague of malice,
how to join the contentious with the bands of peace, how to train up the peaceable
to the longing desire of true Peace; how to supply necessary things to those
that are in need; how to shew to those that be gone astray the path of
righteousness; how to soothe the distressed by words and by sympathy; how to
quench by rebuke those that burn in the desires of the world; how by reasoning
to soften down the threats of the powerful, how to lighten the bands of the
oppressed by all the means that he is master of; how to oppose patience to
those that offer resistance without; how to set forth to those that are full of
pride within a lesson of discipline together with patience; how, with reference
to the misdeeds of those under our charge, mildness may temper zeal, so that it
never relax from earnestness for the rule of right; how zeal may be so kindled
for revenge, that yet by kindling thus it never transgress the bounds of pity;
how to stir the unthankful to love by benefits; how to preserve in love all
that are thankful by services; how to pass by in silence the misdoings of our neighbor,
when he has no power to correct them; how when they may be amended by speaking
to dread silence as consent to them; how to submit to what he passes by in
silence, yet so that none of the poison of annoyance bury itself in his spirit;
how to exhibit the service of good will to the malicious, yet not so as to
depart from the claims of righteousness from kindness; how to render all things
to his neighbors that he is master of, yet in thus rendering them not to be
swelled with pride; in the good deeds which he sets forth to shrink from the
precipice of pride, yet so as not to slacken in the exercise of doing good; so
to lavish the things which he possesses as to take thought how great is the
bounteousness of his Rewarder, lest in bestowing earthly things he think of his
poverty more than need be, and in the offering of the gift a sad look obscure
the light of cheerfulness.</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Gregory I, Morals on Job book 10.5.8]</font><sup><font size="2">27</font></sup></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

instinct to show gratitude and to serve as watchful guardians of their masters'
safety? Hence Scripture cries out to the ungrateful, the slothful, and the
craven: 'Dumb dogs, not able to bark.' (Is. 56.10) To dogs, therefore, is given
the ability to bark in defense of their masters and their homes. Thus you
should learn to use your voice for the sake of Christ, when ravening wolves attack
His sheepfold. Have the word ready on your lips, lest, like a silent watch-dog,
you may appear because of your unfaithfulness to abandon the post entrusted to
you. Such a dog was the friend and companion of an angel. Not without reason
did Raphael in the prophetic book cause this dog to accompany the son of Tobit
when he went on a journey, in order to drive out Asmodeus and thereby confirm
the marriage. The demon is driven out as the result of a grateful recognition
and the union is stabilized.<span>  </span></font><font size="3">And so,
under the symbolism of a dumb animal, the angel Raphael, as director of the
young man Tobias whom he had agreed to protect, was able to arouse sentiments
of gratitude in him. Who would not feel shame if he did not return thanks to
those who are well deserving of it, when he sees that even beasts shun the sin
of ingratitude? These animals hold in grateful memory the sustenance they have
acquired. Are you not mindful of the salvation you have received? </font></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Ambrose

here nor there; it is therefore in the third direction. And thus, neglecting

Rebecca, for his son Isaac. Also in Esdras, it was not sufficient for God when
the Jews were laid waste, unless they forsook their foreign wives, with the

die, she is freed to marry whom she will, only in the Lord. But she will be
happier if she abide thus.”</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">And again:

two shall be in one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord is one

only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the

shall come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who
will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto you

away with attention to prayer, I shall prove with evidence from one text,
omitting all others for the sake of briefness. In the book of Tobit the angel
Raphael says to Tobias, the son: Remember the commandments of your father, that
he ordered you to take a wife from the family of your father. And now, hear me,
brother, do not take into account that devil; but ask for her. And know that
she will be given you for wife this night. And when you shall enter into the chamber,
take of the liver of that fish, and put it on the coals: a smell will spread,
and the devil shall smell it, and he will be driven away, and he shall never
anymore make his appearance about her. And when you shall begin to desire to be
with her, first rise both, and pray the Lord of heaven, that mercy and health
be given you. And do not fear, for she was destined for you before the
centuries, and you shall heal. Therefore, although it is impossible that God's
decree would not come true, yet it does not do away with the practice of
prayer, nor does the design of the election diminish the effort of man's free
will. God rather preordained the effect He intended in such a way that He
desires man's merit to grow through the labor of good works, through perseverance
in supplications, through the practice of virtues. He wants to crown the good
works of men not only according to His own plan but also according to their
merits. </span></font><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Prosper of Aquitaine, De vocatione omnium gentium, PL

throughout the world with their offspring, could not accept the ways and the

he, in his regard for virtue, when asked to give his daughter in marriage, was
not silent regarding his daughter's faults, for fear of seeming to get the
better of the suitor by silence. So when Tobit the son of Tobias asked that his
daughter might be given him, he answered that, according to the law, she ought
to be given him as near of kin, but that he had already given her to six men,
and all of them were dead. (Tob. 7:11) This just man, then, feared more for

their bodies to be killed at the hands of unbelievers surely have learned to stand
against the enemy with the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the
left, that is, in prosperity and adversity. (2 Cor. 6:7) Four rams were
slaughtered because holy teachers and martyrs preserve the four books of the
holy gospel by their faith and labor; because they are protected by the four
chief virtues-prudence, fortitude, temperance, and righteousness; and because
they establish Christ’s flock throughout the world, which is divided into four
regions.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Raguel had the cows and rams

tests, he can only succeed at making martyrs become conquerors.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Or surely Raguel slaughtered those taught by

great evils for His sake, to depart hence without enjoying any good thing; from
whence it is evident, that for such He has prepared another life, and one which
is sweeter and much more endurable. For if it were not so, then he would not

break his bread for the hungry man, prepared to pay quickly the hired servant
for his work. After patiently listening to the reading that has just been
recited, we were wondering at the treatment of the father and of the son, and
at the way they were instructed by the angel, whom they believed to be an
earthly hired servant, under heavenly glory. In truth, Tobit was stricken with
the calamity of blindness in order to receive the angel as a physician, who,
kindled with divine firebrands, gasped, "Prayer is good with fasting and
alms" (Tob. 12:8). The prayer of the just man is the key to heaven. The
prayer ascends, and God's mercy descends. Although the earth is deep down and
heaven is high up, God hears the tongue of man, if his conscience is clean. He
talks with the senses, if there is but a sigh on our part. Rain from the eyes
is enough for his ears; he hears tears more quickly than words. The prayer of
the hater is always driven away from his ears. The soul of the father and of
the son was one; while either of them had his own limbs, they had a singular
union of minds. <span> </span></font><font size="3">Son, says Tobit, let us
dismiss this man, adding something to the wages that were agreed on; because he
has brought us much good with his work (ibid. 1, etc.). And the son, after
recounting the treatment they had received from him, says to his father: Father,
can it possibly be right for so blessed a servant as this to be paid only the
wages that were agreed on, while his good guidance is inestimable? We shall
repay him with too little honor if we determine a measure for his merits.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Did he himself provide only what had been
agreed on? What had been agreed on was that he should show me the region and
the man to whom you had entrusted the money. First, travelling as if on a
heavenly way, he prepared from the fish the eye salve that both you and I
needed; he guided me, got the money back, gave me Sara for a wife. Does he
deserve only the wages that were agreed on, while he was for me like a heavenly
bridesman, and, what is more, father, cured the spots on your eyes by removing
the film that covered them, and lit up our whole house by illuminating the
lamps of your eyes? I now see more clearly because I behold you seeing. My
excellent father, does he not deserve half of the goods? Let a guide and
provider such as this, such a physician and guardian, as he said, receive as
his share half of the goods that he has brought with me, since he has shown
such kindness to me in his guidance. The good father liked the response of his
wise son. He started asking the hired servant to take indeed his wages. </font></span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif"><font size="3">[Augustine

hire—this is worse, if he be infirm, for “woe to him that shall scandalize one
of these little ones.” How do you know whether there be an angel in him? For we
ought not to doubt that there can be an angel in the hired servant, since Christ
can be, who is accustomed to be in the least. Give the hired servant his reward
therefore and do not defraud him of the price of his labor, because you too are
a hired servant of Christ, and He has sent you to His vineyard, and a heavenly
reward is laid up for you. Do not therefore injure the servant working in truth
nor the hired servant giving his life, do not despise the needy man who spends
his life at his labor and maintains it by his hire. For this is to kill a man,
to deny him the succor required for his life. You too are a hired servant on
this earth; give his reward to the hired servant, that you too may be able to
say to the Lord when you pray: “Give a reward to them that uphold you.” (Eccl.

more strong against the temptations of the devil, fasted when about to contend
with him, that we might know that we can in no other way overcome the
enticements of evil. Further, the devil himself hurled the first dart of his
temptations from the quiver of pleasure, saying: “If You be the Son of God,
command that these stones become bread.” (Matt. 4:3) After which the Lord said:
“Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word of God;” (Mat. 4:4) and
would not do it, although He could, in order to teach us by a salutary precept
to attend rather to the pursuit of reading than to pleasure. And since they say
that we ought not to fast, let them prove for what cause Christ fasted, unless
it were that His fast might be an example to us. Lastly, in His later words He
taught us that evil cannot be easily overcome except by our fasting, saying:
“This kind of devils is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.” (Matt. 17:21)
And what is the intention of the Scripture which teaches us that Peter fasted,
and that the revelation concerning the baptism of Gentiles was made to him when
fasting and praying, (Acts 10:10) except to show that the Saints themselves
advance when they fast. Finally, Moses received the Law when he was fasting;
Exodus 34:28 and so Peter when fasting was taught the grace of the New
Testament. Daniel too by virtue of his fast stopped the mouths of the lions and
saw the events of future times. (Dan. 6-7) And what safety can there be for us
unless we wash away our sins by fasting, since Scripture says that fasting and
alms do away sin? (Tob. 12:8-9) </span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif">[Ambrose of Milan, Letter 63.15-16 NPNF

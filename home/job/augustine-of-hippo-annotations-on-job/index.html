Jesus Christ, its head; as if it were in the time when tribulation and trials
abound, in these days announced by the Lord in these words: "The days will
come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Lord, and you will not
see it (4). In fact, when the Savior was on earth, no anxiety came to pierce
the nascent Christian people: he was composed of the first believers, among
whom more than five hundred brothers, to whom, according to the testimony of
the Apostle, the Lord deigned to appear after his resurrection (5). There was
no reason then to fear seeing the Church badly governed, nor divided by the
betrayals of heresy or schism. Nor did she suffer from external persecution:
there was still no trial for her either inside or outside. Job speaks here in
the name of humanity, that is to say, the people of the New Testament, desiring
to see these days again, as the Savior had predicted. He calls them months, not
years, because from the moment Christ chooses His disciples until His death, we
can only count months, not years.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The sun indeed seems more distant from the northern regions and closer to the
southern countries. That is why those whom Saint Paul says are nearer, in the
light of the Gospel, are here rightly called the land of the south. Moreover,
if we call the Evangelists heaven, as in these words: "The heavens declare
the glory of God," for it is from them that it is said, "Through all
the universe have their accents sounded: their speech has gone to the ends of
the earth (2); So may we denominate under the name of earth the multitudes to

Christ entered their rest on leaving this world, the authority of the preachers
of the Gospel is no less solid in the churches of Gentility; it was therefore
through divine mercy and not through the authority of the Christian Church of
Judea. So we must see an interrogation in the passage that we explain, and hear
it in this sense: When the earth of the south was at rest, that is to say when
there was no more in this world of Christian society among the Jews, did you,
with him, strengthen the preachers of the Gospel, establish the authority of
the divine Scriptures, of which God in His mercy also spread the light among

storms? Let us see here with brevity the Lord enumerates in three words all
that must be despised in temptation by those who build on the rock, which, on
the contrary, those who build on the sand must fear. He names the rain, the
riverbed, the voice of the storm or the wind. To be tempted by the rain is to
expose oneself to sin, misunderstanding what is most pointed out in the holy
Scriptures; if, for example, on the occasion of this passage: "The one to
whom he is less pardoned loves less," 2 someone would say, "Let us do
evil, so that good may come." ), and that he should remain in sin in order
to make grace abound (4). There are a host of other passages in which the
reckless misinterpret the word of God, and lose themselves by promising
themselves impunity, under the pretext that the Scriptures continually exalt
divine goodness. To be tempted by the river is to follow the authors of these
fatal interpretations. He calls the river the torrent formed by the waters of
the rain. "Who has traced," said he, "the bed of a raging
river," that is to say, the bed where they gather and flow? There are,
then, vessels of anger prepared for perdition, 1 which hear the Scriptures as
we have just said. They give free rein to the floods of their pernicious
teachings, which nevertheless the fertile fields know how to repel; they
agitate overthrow and drag away all that is without consistency with all the
more impetuosity, that they seem led by the authority of God. To be tempted by
the winds is to listen to the voice of the proud, whose empty speeches have no
other support than their feeble reason. When a man, by resisting divine
precepts, has prepared his condemnation to the judgment of God, and built on
the sand, he will not be able to resist the breath of these winds, and his fall
delivers passage, to the voices of the storm. I believe that these words,
"impetuous rains," designate passages difficult to fix, to

To understand this passage, is it necessary to study, in astronomy, the
properties of all these stars? I would be surprised if this were necessary:
​​it would be a long work, we will not stop there. Should we not rather, under
the name of a few stars, understand all the stars, taking the part for the
whole? I suppose that Mazuroth is a star, for there is no Greek word that
corresponds to it; we see enough that it is a Hebrew expression. In the
following passage: "I begot you before Lucifer (4)," the game is also
taken for the whole. Lucifer was not the first of all creatures, and before
Lucifer did not mean before any creature. But here Lucifer means all the stars;
it is, I repeat, the part for the whole, and by all the stars, all the times
must be heard; for it is the stars that are said: "They will serve as
signs to mark the times" (5). Therefore the Lord was born before all
times, not in time; so he is co-eternal with the Father. To name only the Pleiades,
the Orion, Mazuroth, and the evening star, is therefore to name all the stars
by the name of some. Since elsewhere with Lucifer we designate them all, even
more so can we do it here, where so many stars are named. But why is it said of
one: "to distinguish the links," of the others "to open, to
disperse; Of this: "to raise at the appointed time; From that one:

circle of the Pleiades, distinguished the links of the stars of the Orlon? We
can sometimes change the words of two sentences; for example, in this passage
from the Psalms: "He who dwells in heaven will laugh at them, the
Lordships will make a mockery," the thought would remain absolutely the
same if it were said: He who dwells in heaven will make fun of them. the Lord
will laugh at them; for the Lord is the same as he who dwells in heaven. For a
similar reason the name of the Pleiades here has the same meaning as that of
the Orlon, because both designate all the stars, and the stars that we have
just named represent to us in the same relations the faithful of the Church
whose conversation is in heaven (1). Their bonds consist in attaching
themselves to each other and to God, so as not to fall. But charity never falls
(2). Who would know it, if it had not been taught by the One who said: "I
give you a new commandment, that you love one another (3); And again: "He
who loved me is, beloved of my Father (4)? The circle which encloses them is
that of the divine Scriptures, from which they do not go out. Who could open it
if it is not the one who makes the veil fall when we attach to him? The time
will come to open these books, that is, to manifest the truth, when the Lord
will come to illuminate the secrets of darkness, to discover the innermost
thoughts of the heart. Then everyone will receive from God the praise that is
due to him (5). He alone will fulfill these mysteries in his time: when he
appears, he who is our life, we will also appear with him in glory (6). He will
lead them to the place that was prepared for them, when he will put them in
possession of the house built by their merits. "Whoever builds on this
foundation works that remain, will have the reward (7). "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

those who have known God, and have not glorified Him as God? They did not wish
to make him live in them; they have been changed, and vanished into the vanity
of their thoughts. Will we give it a better meaning? For all we will be

change, since it says, "And we will change (2). When the righteous will
change, it will be the sky that will undergo a change. Heaven indeed is the

still feels in his another law which rises against the law of its spirit and
holds it captive under the law of sin (1). He gives birth on the rocks at the

thus that those whose flesh fights against the spirit, and the spirit against

punishments of which God threatens the sinner from afar; it bears witness to
the word that closely overturns all errors. There are, then, two very distinct
ideas here: the threat which discovers in the future the punishment of the
sinner is the line which the bow throws in the distance; the word that tames
the passions of the moment is the sword with which one pushes away with one's

condemn their present iniquities. If the joys of hope were not united in us

into a reckless presumption, and we would not be told by the Psalmist,
"Rejoice in him. with trembling (5). He is indignant with himself; he
wants to destroy the ardor of concupiscence, and the fears of the flesh, which
make us repel suffering and fighting. It is probably in this sense that it
says, "Be angry and do not sin (1). It is with salutary indignation that
he must condemn himself and say to himself: "Why are you sad, O my soul,

"And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everything to
myself." He was going to die for us, and after his resurrection ascend to
heaven: "Wherever the body will be," said he, "the eagles will
gather there." For he has satiated with supernatural goods one whose youth
will be renewed like that of the eagle. The elevation of the eagle may also be
related to this passage of St. Paul: "If we are carried away as if outside
ourselves, it is for God; As the following passage relating to the vulture
relates to this other of the same Apostle "If we are more restrained, it
is for you" (4). Here it is: "And that the vulture will wait near his
nest perched on the rocks? He no longer expresses the state of a soul which
rises in the contemplations of a holy rapture, but the devotion of the one who,
in less elevated ways, patiently deals with the salvation of men and who wants
the wicked dead to grace to be justified by the word, as devoured by it, to
enter the body of the Church. We know that the vulture feeds on corpses. That
is why he is near his nest where he lays down his widowers, a figure of works
to be done in this life. He is on the rock; For after having said, "If we
are more restrained," it is for you, "the Apostle adds
immediately:" For the charity of Christ urges us. " "Now the stone
was Christ (6). - He will wait motionless. This is the same thought as in this
passage: "I feel pressed on both sides I would like to die and be with
Jesus Christ, which is unquestionably the best," and relates to the
elevation of the eagle. On the other hand, like the vulture waiting near his
nest "I want to live again, which is necessary for you (7). Now, as the
stone still designates the whole Church, the point of the rock is the head of

be dragged into the failings of nature: Doubt comes sometimes shake it;
ignorance, inherent in the human mind, prevents it from seeing the real merit
that. God attaches to his devotion and his zeal; but as his eyes discover
eternal salvation in the distance, he always knows how to act with an entirely
disinterested charity. And if he has given his care, distribute his treasures

with the Most High will he be at rest? That is to say, why do you keep silent
talking to the Almighty? "Whoever dared to take God will answer him thus?
This is a questioning, and here is the meaning: Does it take God, the one who
talks about it to answer him? We can discuss with the Almighty, addressing his
questions, without attacking or refuting him. It is not because He is Almighty
that we must avoid any discussion with Him. It is not accused either, if in
this discussion it is questioned as truth itself. As for these words,
"Whoever discusses with the Lord will he rest? Here is the meaning: since
he who discusses with the Lord is not at rest, he must not enter into
discussion with him to rest himself afterward. Usually the one who discusses
proposes some objections: but he who makes it to God can not rest, he can find
no rest, only by conforming his thoughts to the will of God, without
contradicting anything. For "he who takes God will answer him thus:"
that is to say, if he answers by talking with him, it is to take him back, and
he can not rest. Whence this word: "O (641) man, who are you, to challenge
God?" But had Job done this? God did not regard him as an opponent, as his
friends did without understanding him, and he gives him this testimony at the
beginning and at the end of the book. If, therefore, he addressed these words
to him, is it not because of the very special role he plays here? He is the
figure of the body of Jesus Christ, of his Church, of which a great number of members
are weak, and although they do not despair, they are constantly exposed to
falling. Scarcely do they dare to advance: their steps are not multiplied, and
the tranquility of the sinner excites their desire. They say, "Does God
see them? "Does the Most High know of it? Now these impious,
happy-of-the-century people are increasing their wealth. It is therefore in
vain that I purified my heart, and washed my hands in innocence: I was scourged
during the whole day, and condemned in the morning (2). Hence this answer from
Job in the next two verses.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

once; I will not add anything. If there is not one. Hidden meaning in this
sentence, how can Job say that he has spoken only once, since he has spoken so
many times? How does he say that he will not take it again, since he is going
to talk again? The word here must be understood as the disposition of the soul
who, seeking out external objects, abandons his God and dares to resist him.
And when it rushes into it with more ardor, Scripture calls its action a cry.
Thus the Lord says that the cry of Sodom ascended to him (1). To this word, to
this cry is opposed the holy and pious silence of which it is said: He will be
in silence, free from all fear, far from all sin. Job is therefore right to say
that he spoke only once, always the same language in his whole life as an old
man, whereas he was only a breath that goes and never comes back (2 ). Now that
he puts his hand to his mouth to speak no more, he promises to add nothing to
this language of the past, to no longer separate from God. Thus be it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

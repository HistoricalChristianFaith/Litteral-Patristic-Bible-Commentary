Mai.] Yet a new covenant God promiseth us, now that "the first hath waxed
old and is near to vanish away," according to the words of the divine
Paul. Yea, He even says by one of tho holy prophets, "Behold the days
come, saith the Lord, when I will perfect with the house of Israel, and with
tho house of Judah, a new covenant: not according to the covenant which I made
with their fathers in tho day when I took hold of their hand to bring them out
of the land of Egypt." If therefore the new covenant is the second, and
different from the first, there is every necessity for those who wish to live
according to it, to abandon the old laws, and conform to those which will guide
them into the newness of the gospel polity. But of all this we can see that the
Scribes and Pharisees comprehended nothing: for being altogether destitute of
knowledge of the sacred Scriptures, they had but one sole purpose, on every
occasion to find fault with the divine and heavenly preaching. They lie in wait
therefore for the holy apostles in their constant attendance upon our common
Saviour Christ, and tell Him concerning them; "Behold we see those who are
under Thy instruction acting contrary to the precepts of the law: for they do
what it is not lawful to do on the sabbaths: for while the law enjoins men to
do no work on the sabbath, and to meddle with no labour whatsoever, tho
disciples are rubbing ears of corn with their hands." But tell me, dost
not thou thyself, when setting thy sabbath meal, break the bread? Why then dost
thou blame others? But that we may use against thee the bulwark of the
Saviour's words, listen;</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

plain to His hearers the pathway of salvation <a name="p93"><font color="#000000">|93</font></a> opened
through Him: and immediately after His teaching He displayed His godlike power,
having first by words smoothed, as it were, the road to belief. For the miracle
sometimes converts unto faith those who had disbelieved the word. But the
Pharisees watched Him, to see if He would heal on the sabbath: for such is the
nature of an envious man, that he makes the praises of others food for his own
disease, and wickedly is maddened by their reputation. And what once more said
He to this, Who knoweth all things, Who searcheth the hearts, and understandeth
whatever is therein? "For with Him is the light," as Scripture
declares. "He spake to him that had the withered hand, Stand forth into
the midst." And why did He do this? It might perhaps be to move the cruel

wise in very deed is this question, and a statement most suitable to meet their
folly. For if it be lawful to do good on the sabbath, and nothing prevents the
sick being pitied by God, cease thus picking up opportunities for faultfinding
against Christ, and bringing down on thy own head the sentence which the Father
has decreed against those who dishonour the Son: for thou hast heard Him where
He says of Him by the voice of David, "And I will cut off His enemies from
before His face, and put to flight those that hate Him." But if it be not
lawful to do good on the sabbath, and the law forbids the saving of life, thou
hast made thyself an accuser of the law, thou hast slandered the commandment,
for which the ministry of Moses is regarded with admiration. No, he replies,
the God of all did not enact the law of the sabbath for Himself, but for us
rather, whose neck is bowed to it. Thou sayest well; I assent to thy words;
therefore that which is divine is free from the compulsion of the law. Why,
then, dost thou blame Christ for wishing also to shew mercy on the sabbath, and
benefit a living soul? And were it our wish to examine closely the law enacted
for the sabbath, we should find it ordained by God for purposes of mercy. For
He commanded to <a name="p94"><font color="#000000">|94</font></a> do no work on the sabbath, and entirely to
abstain from labour, and even to give rest at the same time to the irrational
animals. For He said, that its purpose was, "that thy manservant may rest,
and thy maidservant, thy ox, and thy beast of burden, and all thy cattle."
But He Who has mercy on the ox and other animals, how would not He pity on the
sabbath day a man who was attacked by a severe and irremediable malady? </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_02_sermons_12_25.htm#21" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>21</u></span></sup></a></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that Christ did was for our edification, and for the benefit of those who
believe in Him; and by proposing to us His own conduct as a sort of pattern of
the spiritual mode of life, He would make us true worshippers. Let us see,
therefore, in the pattern and example provided for us by Christ's acts, the
manner in which we ought to make our supplications unto God. We must pray
secretly and in concealment, and with no one seeing us: for this is the
signification of Jesus going into the mountain alone, and praying, as it were,
leisurely. And this He has Himself taught us, saying; "But thou, when thou
prayest, enter into thy closet." For we ought to pray, not seeking after
glory, but "lifting up holy hands," while the soul, as it were,
mounts aloft to the contemplation of God, withdrawing from all tumult, and
quitting worldly anxiety. And this we must do not with fickleness, nor with a
listless feebleness; but, on the contrary, with earnestness and zeal, and a
patience worthy of admiration: for thou hast heard that Jesus did not merely
pray, but that He also passed the night in this duty.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

consubstantial and equal to Him in all things, and in no way whatsoever unlike
Him? "For without all controversy the less is blessed of the
greater:" and decidedly he who gives is greater than he who makes request
to receive something.' Let then those who pervert the right faith teach us
first of all, of what they imagine the Son to be in need?<i> </i>And what did
He seek to obtain as not as yet possessing it? He is the true light; He is in
His own nature life, and the cause of life; He is the Lord also of powers; He
is wisdom and righteousness; the Creator and train or of the universe; superior
to every thing that has been brought into being; is the King of the universe;
the dispenser of heaven and earth; the giver, with God the Father, of every
blessing. And this thou wilt learn by what the blessed Paul has somewhere
written; "Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and our Lord
Jesus Christ." He is conspicuous on the throne far above, and is glorified
by the whole rational creation. Accordingly He is by substance the heir of all
the divine dignities of God the Father: and therefore spake He unto Him, that
"all that is Mine is Thine; and Thine Mine: and I am glorified in
them." But He Who has every thing that belongs to God the Father as His
very own, of what is He still in need? But if, in fine, He is in need of any
thing, and they affirm that this is true, there is nothing to prevent our
saying, that there are certain things of which the Father Himself is in need.
For if all that the Son has is the Father's, but there is something of which
the Son is in need, therefore must the Father too be similarly circumstanced:
for all that the Son hath is the Father's. But the Father is all perfect, and
is deficient of no good whatsoever that is suitable to Deity: therefore is the
Son all perfect, as having all that the Father hath, and being His image and
the impress of His substance: but in the impress there is displayed entirely
the original form, and in the original form there exists entirely the impress.
And thus much then as respects them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

then, shall we make to this? That ye are utterly ignorant of the mystery of the
incarnation of the Only-begotten. Remember the blessed Evangelist John, who
says; "And the Word was made flesh." And of this the all-wise Paul
has given us a plain proof by saying concerning Him: "For He taketh not
hold at all of the angels, but taketh hold of the seed of Abraham: whence it
became Him to be made like unto His brethren in all things, that He might
become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining unto God, to
make propitiation for the sins of the people." On what account therefore
does Nestorius eject from the measure of human nature Him Who, though divinely
begotten as the Word by God the Father, yet humbled Himself unto emptying, even
to becoming our brother, by being made like unto us, and similar in all things
to the inhabitants of the earth, sin only excepted? For having become like unto
us from His exceeding gentleness and love to mankind, He disdains not human
things: but sets before us His conduct as a type of goodness unto the end, that
as I said we may be earnest in following His footsteps.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Lord Jesus Christ, having spent the night in prayer, and having conversed with
His Father and God in heaven in a way ineffable and beyond our powers of
understanding, and such as is known solely to Himself,----even therein making
Himself an example unto us of that which is necessary for salvation; for He
taught us in what way we too may rightly and blamelessly offer our
prayers:----comes down from the mountain, and appoints those who were to be the
world's teachers, <a name="p97"><font color="#000000">|97</font></a> according to the words He spake, "Ye
are the light of the world." And of this appointment of the holy Apostles,
the blessed David also makes mention, addressing himself, as it were, to
Christ: "Thou shalt make them rulers over all the earth; they shall make
mention of Thy name in every successive generation." For verily, while
they were in the body, they made mention of the glory of Christ, telling His
mystery both in cities and villages: and now that they have been called to the
mansions that are above, none the less do they still even thus converse with us
about Him, by the most wise history which they have written concerning Him. And
those, indeed, who were appointed priests according to the law of Moses, even
Aaron and his company, were made beautiful to the senses by vestments suitable
to their priestly dignity; but the divine disciples, being adorned with
spiritual gifts, had entrusted to them the ministry of the Gospel oracles. For
it was said unto them, "Heal the sick: cast out daemons: cleanse lepers:
raise the dead." And being thus invested with Christ's power, they have
filled the whole world with astonishment. But mark the extreme moderation of
the Evangelist: for he does not simply say that the holy Apostles were
appointed, but rather, by introducing the record of these chief ones each by
name, takes care that no one should venture to enrol himself in the company of
those that were chosen. For as Paul saith, "No man taketh this honour upon
himself, but he that is called by God." And though the holy Apostles were
called by name to this great and splendid dignity, yet from time to time some
men have gone to such a pitch of madness and audacity, as even to name
themselves Apostles of Christ, and to usurp an honour not granted unto them. Of
these the divine disciples have made mention<i>; </i>for they say, "Such
are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into angels of
righteousness. And no wonder: for Satan even transforms himself into an angel
of light. It is no great thing, therefore, if his ministers also transform
themselves into angels of righteousness." But we neither acknowledge nor
will receive any one, except those only so named in the Evangelic writings, and
him who was appointed after them, the most wise Paul: to whom also the Saviour
Himself bore witness, saying, that <a name="p98"><font color="#000000">|98</font></a> he is a vessel of
election for Me, to carry My name before all the heathen."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

prophets also proclaimed them. As, for instance, it is written in the Mosaic
record, "And ye shall take fine flour, and make it into twelve loaves: and
he shall put them in two rows upon the pure table before the Lord. And ye shall
put upon the row frankincense and salt: and they shall be for loaves, sot
before the Lord for a memorial." For the bread that came down from heaven,
and giveth life to the world, Who else can it be but Christ the Saviour of the
universe?<i> </i>And in imitation too of Him, the blessed disciples also are
named loaves: for having been made partakers of Him Who nourishes us unto life
eternal, they also nourish by their own writings those who hunger and thirst
after righteousness. And as the Saviour Who is the true light called the
disciples also light:----"for ye are the light of the world:"----so
also being Himself the broad of life, He has bestowed upon His disciples to be
ranked as loaves." </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_02_sermons_12_25.htm#25" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>25</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> And observe, I pray, the marvellous art of the law: <i>"</i>for
ye shall put, it says, upon the loaves frank-incense and salt." Now the
frankincense is the symbol of a sweet odour; and the salt that of understanding
and good sense: both of which existed in the highest degree in the holy
Apostles. For their life was one of a sweet savour, as they also said, that
"we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God:" and they were moreover
also full of understanding, so that I hear the prophet David even singing of
them in the Psalms: "There is Benjamin in entrancement: the princes of
Judah are their leaders: the princes of Zebulon, the princes of
Nephthalim." For the blessed disciples were chosen out of almost every
tribe of Israel, and were the bearers of light to the world, "holding up
the word of life." And the wonder indeed <a name="p99"><font color="#000000">|99</font></a> is this, that
the sages of the Greeks possess a splendid copiousness of speech, and an
admirable beauty of language: but the disciples of our Saviour were mere
artificers, and boatmen, and fishers, having no boast of words, no fluency of
picked phrases, and in expression indeed were simple men, but rich in knowledge:
yet is the literature of the Greeks, with its sonorous phrases, silent; while
the power of the Evangelic preaching has possession of the world. God also
makes mention of them by the voice of Jeremiah, saying of the enemy of all,
even Satan; "Woe to him, who multiplieth for himself that which is not
his, and maketh his collar thick and heavy: for suddenly shall they arise that
shall bite him, and thy adversaries shall wake up, and thou shalt be their
prey." For Satan had gathered unto him all the inhabitants of the earth,
though they were not his, and had caused them to be his worshippers, making his
collar heavy: but those who were to plunder his goods woke up: for the net of
the apostolic teaching caught all those that were in error, and brought back unto
God the whole world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the Syriac] Those are the Saviour's words, when directing His disciples into
the newness of the Gospel life after their appointment to the apostolate. But
we must see of what poor it is that He speaks such great things: for in the
Gospel according to Matthew it is written, "Blessed are the poor in
spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:" wishing us to understand by
the poor in spirit the man who entertains lowly thoughts of himself, and whoso
mind, so to speak, is closely reefed, and hi3 heart gentle, and ready to yield,
and entirely free from the guilt of pride.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Mai.] Such a one is worthy of admiration, and the friend of God; yea, He even
said by one of the holy prophets; "Upon whom will I look but upon the
humble and peaceable, and that trembleth at my words?" And the prophet David
also said, that "a contrite and humbled heart God will not set at
nought." Moreover, the Saviour Himself also says, "Learn of Me, for I
am meek and humble in heart." In the lessons, however, now set before us,
He says, that the poor shall be blessed, without the addition of its being in
spirit. But the Evangelists so speak, not as contradicting one another, but as
dividing oftentimes the narrative among them: and at one time they recapitulate
the same particulars, and at another that which has been omitted by one,
another includes in his narrative, that nothing essential for their benefit may
be hidden from those who believe on Christ.----[From the Syriac.] It seems
likely, therefore, that He here means by the poor, whom He pronounces blessed,
such as care not for wealth, and are superior to covetousness, and despisers of
base gifts, and of a disposition free from the love of money, and who set no
value upon the ostentatious display of riches. <a name="p103"><font color="#000000">|103</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

so the most wise Paul manifestly guides us into the best doctrines, where he
says, "Let your disposition be free from the love of money, being
contented with what it has:" and to this he has added, that "having
nourishment and the means of shelter, we will be therewith content." For
it was necessary, absolutely necessary, for those whose business it would be to
proclaim the saving message of the Gospel to have a mind careless about wealth,
and occupied solely with the desire of better things. The argument, however,
does not affect all whose means are abundant, but those only whose desire is
set upon riches: and who are these? All to whom our Saviour's words apply:
"Store not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Matthew, however, again He says; "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
after righteousness: for they shall be filled:" but here He simply says,
that "those that hunger shall be filled." We say, therefore, that it
is a great and noble thing to hunger and thirst after righteousness: that is,
habitually to take part in earnest endeavours after piety:----for such is the
meaning of righteousness:----as if it were our meat and drink. And inasmuch as
we ought to give to this passage also a meaning, in accordance with the
foregoing explanations, we say again as follows: The Saviour pronounced those
blessed who love a voluntary poverty, to enable them honourably, and without
distraction, to practise the apostolic course of life. For it is in plain
keeping with the having neither gold nor silver in their purses, nor two coats,
to endure also very great hardness in their way of life, and scarcely obtain
food for their need. But this is a burdensome thing for those who are suffering
poverty and persecutions, and therefore He That knoweth hearts, very suitably
does not permit us to be dispirited because of the results of poverty: for He
says, that those who hunger now for their piety's sake towards Him shall be
filled: that is, they shall enjoy the intellectual and spiritual blessings that
are in store. <a name="p104"><font color="#000000">|104</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

tears from their eyes: for this is a thing common to all without exception,

those rather who shun a life of merriment and vanity, and carnal pleasures.
----[From Mai.] For of the one we say, that they live in enjoyment and
laughter; whereas believers abandoning luxury and the careless life of carnal
pleasures, and all but weeping because of their abhorrence of worldly things,
are, our Saviour declares, blessed; and for this reason, as having commanded us
to choose poverty, He also crowns with honours the things which necessarily
accompany poverty: such, for instance, as the want of things necessary for
enjoyment, and the lowness of spirits caused by privation: for it is written,
that "many are the privations of the just, and the Lord shall deliver them

did the Lord mention persecution, even before the Apostles had been sent on
their mission. The Gospel anticipated what would happen. For it was altogether
to be expected that those who proclaimed the Gospel message, and made the Jews
abandon their legal mode of worship to learn the Gospel way of virtuous living,
while too they won over idolaters to the acknowledgment of the truth, would
come in contact with many impious and unholy men. For such are they who, in their
enmity against piety, excite wars and persecutions against those who preach
Jesus. To prevent them, therefore, from falling into unreasonable distress
whenever the time should arrive at which such events were sure to befal them
from some quarter or other, He forewarns them for their benefit, that even the
assault of things grievous to bear will bring its reward and advantage to them.
For they shall reproach you, He says, as deceivers, and as trying to mislead:
they shall separate you from them, even from their friendship and society: but
let none of these things trouble you, He says: <a name="p105"><font color="#000000">|105</font></a> for what

their benefit, that nothing strange will happen unto them, even when suffering
these things: but that, on the contrary, they will resemble those who before
their time were the bearers to the Israelites of the words that came from God
above. They were persecuted, they were sawn asunder, they perished slain by the
sword, they endured reproaches unjustly cast upon them. He would therefore have
them also understand that they shall be partakers with those whose deeds they
have imitated; nor shall they fail in winning the prophet's crown, after having
travelled by the same road. <a name="p106"><font color="#000000">|106</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

alone, but by every word that goeth forth from the mouth of God." All
Scripture, indeed, is inspired of God; but this is especially true of the proclamations
in the Gospels: for He Who in old time delivered unto the Israelites by the
ministry of Moses the law that consisted in types and shadows, the very same
having become man spake unto us, as the wise Paul testifies, writing;
"God, Who in divers manners spake in old time to the fathers by the
prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son:"<i> </i>and
"we are taught of God:" for Christ is in truth God and the Son of
God. Let us therefore fix our careful attention upon what He says: and scrupulously
examine the very depth of His meaning. For "Woe, He says, unto you rich,

fitly is this added to His previous discourse: for having already shewn that
poverty for God's sake is the mother of every blessing, and said that the
hungering and weeping of the saints would not be without a reward, He proceeds
to speak of the opposite class of things, and says of them, that they are
productive of grief and condemnation. For He blames indeed the rich, and those
who indulge immoderately in pleasures, and are ever in merriment, in order that
He may leave no means untried of benefitting those who draw near unto Him, and
chief of all the holy Apostles. For if the endurance of poverty for God's sake,

order therefore that men may be won by the desire of the crowns of reward unto
willingness to labour, and voluntary poverty for God's sake; and, on the other
hand, by fear of the threatened punishment, may flee from riches, and from
living in luxury and merriment, that is to say, in worldly amusements, He says
that the one are heirs of the kingdom of heaven, but that the others will be
involved in the utmost misery: "for ye have received, He says, your

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this truth we are permitted to behold beautifully delineated in the Gospel
parables like as in a painting. For we have heard read that there was a rich

pain; and the rich man felt no pity for him.----But Lazarus, it says, was
carried to Abraham's bosom; while he was in torments and in flame. And when he
saw Lazarus at rest and in happiness in Abraham's bosom, he besought saying,
"Father Abraham have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip

flame." But what was blessed Abraham's reply? "Son, thou hast
received thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus evil things; but now he is
here in happiness, and thou art tormented." True therefore is what is here
said by Christ of those who live in wealth and luxury and merriment, that
"ye have received your consolation:" and of those who now are full,
that they shall <a name="p108"><font color="#000000">|108</font></a> hunger, and that those who laugh now

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
come and let us examine the matter among ourselves. Our Saviour in His parables
has thus spoken: "Two men went up unto the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee, and the other a publican. And the Pharisee forsooth prayed saying,
God I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of mankind, extortioners, unjust,
adulterers; or like this publican. I fast twice in the week: and I pay tithes
of all that I possess. But the publican, He says, did not venture to lift up
his eyes unto heaven, but stood smiting his breast and saying, God be merciful
to me, a sinner. Verily I say unto you, that this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other." For the proud Pharisee was boasting over
the publican, and indecently assuming the rank of a lawgiver, would have
condemned one, on whom it was rather his duty to have shewn pity: but the other
was the accuser of his own infirmity, and thereby aided in his own justification;
for it is written, "Declare thou thy sins first, that thou mayest be
justified." Let us therefore unloose, that is, set free those who are
suffering sicknesses from having been condemned by us, in order that God may
also unloose us from our faults: for He condemneth not, but rather sheweth
mercy.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Closely
neighbouring, so to speak, upon the virtues which we have just mentioned is
compassion, of which He next makes mention. For it is a most excelling thing,
and very pleasing to God, and in the highest degree becoming to pious souls:
and concerning which it may suffice for us to imprint upon our mind that it is
an attribute of the divine nature. "For be ye, He says, merciful, as also
your heavenly Father is merciful." But that we shall be recompensed with
bountiful hand by God, Who giveth all things abundantly to them that love Him,
He has given us full assurance by saying, that "good measure, and squeezed
down, and running over shall they give into your bosom:" adding this too,
"for with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you." There
is however an apparent incompatibility between the two declarations: for if we
are to receive "good measure, and squeezed down, and running over,"
how "shall we be paid back the same measure wherewith we mete?" for
this implies an equal recompense, and not one of <a name="p109"><font color="#000000">|109</font></a>
far-surpassing abundance. What say we then? The all wise Paul frees us from our
difficulties, by bringing us the solution of the matters in question. For he
says, that "he that soweth sparingly, meaning thereby, that he who
distributeth the necessaries of life to those who are in penury and affliction
moderately, and so to speak, with contracted hand, and not plentifully and
largely," shall also reap sparingly: and he "that soweth in blessings,
in blessings shall also reap." By which is meant, he who bountifully * * *

for a man is acceptable according to that which he hath, and not according to
that which he hath not. [From the Syriac.] And this the law of the very wise
Moses has taught us in type: for those that were under the law brought
sacrifices to God according to what they severally possessed, and were able to
afford: some for instance bullocks, and some rams, or sheep, or doves, or
pigeons, or meal mingled with oil, but even he who offered this * *, because he
had no calf to offer, though so little and to be procured so cheaply, was equal
to the other as regards his intention. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

too we must discuss among ourselves: For is it the case, that every one who is

off from the expectation of God's grace? Is he entirely shut out from the hope
of the saints? Has he neither inheritance nor part with them that are crowned?
Not so, we say, hut rather on the contrary, that the rich man might have shewn
mercy on Lazarus, and so have been made partaker of his consolation. For the
Saviour pointed out a way of salvation to those who possess earthly wealth,
saying, "Make unto yourselves friends of the unrighteous mammon, that when
ye depart this life they may receive you into their tents."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Mai.] The blessed Paul speaks the truth where he says, that "if any one be
in Christ, he is a new creation:" for all things have become new, both in
Him and by Him, both covenant, and law, and mode of life. But look closely and
see how thoroughly the mode of life here described becomes those holy teachers,
who were about to proclaim the message of salvation to every quarter of the
world: and yet from this very fact they must expect that their persecutors
would be beyond numbering, and that they would plot against them in many
different ways, if then the result had been that the disciples had become
indignant at these vexations, and wished for vengeance on those that annoyed
them, they would have kept silence and passed them by, no longer offering them
the divine message, nor calling them to the knowledge of the truth. It was
necessary therefore to restrain the mind of the holy teachers by so solemn a
sense of the duty of patience, as to make them bear with fortitude whatever might
befal, oven though men insulted them, yea and plotted against them impiously.
And such was the conduct of Christ Himself above all others for our example:
for while still hanging upon the precious cross, with the Jewish populace
making Him their sport, He put up unto God the Father prayers in their behalf,
saying, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." Yea, and the
blessed Stephen too, while the stones wore smiting him, knelt down, and prayed,
saying, "Lord, lay not this sin upon them." And the blessed Paul also
says, "being reproached we bless, being reviled we entreat."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

exhortation of our Lord therefore was necessary for the  <a name="p111"><font color="#000000">|111</font></a>

admirably: for it is full of all philosophy </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_03_sermons_26_38.htm#6" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>6</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">.

mere impossibilities the oracles of the Spirit, He separates such from those
able to hear, and says, "I speak unto you that hear and are prepared
readily to perform My words." For the gloriousness of spiritual fortitude
is displayed in temptations and labours. Imitate therefore in these things
Christ, "Who when He was reviled, reviled not again, suffering He
threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously."
But perhaps thou wilt object, saying within thyself, 'Christ was God, but I a
frail man, having but a feeble mind, and one unable to resist the attack of
covetousness and pain.' Thou speakest rightly: for the mind of man easily
slides into wrong doing. Nevertheless, I say, The Lord has not left thee
destitute of His compassion and love: thou hast Him by thee, yea within thee,
by the Holy Ghost: for we are His abode, and He lodgeth in the souls of them
that love Him. He gives thee strength to bear nobly whatever befals, and to

Christ is the end of the law and the prophets, is declared by the most wise
Paul: for the law served as a schoolmaster to guide men unto His mystery.
"But now that faith has come, as the blessed Paul has again himself said,
we are no longer under a guide: for no longer are we children in mind, but, on
the contrary, have grown up to the perfect man, to the measure of the mature
age of the fulness of Christ." We do <a name="p112"><font color="#000000">|112</font></a> not therefore
require milk, but rather, food of a more solid nature, such as Christ bestows
upon us, by setting before us the pathway of that righteousness which surpasses
the power of the law. For He said Himself to the holy apostles, "Verily I
say unto you, except your righteousness be over and above, more than of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." This
then it is necessary to discuss, what, namely, is meant by the "over and
above" in the righteousness in accordance with the saving message of the
Gospel.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
law spoken by Moses to them of old time enacted like for like: and while it
forbade the doing a wrong, it by no means commanded those who had already been
injured to bear patiently, as the Gospel law requires. For it says, "Thou
shalt not kill: thou shalt not steal: thou shalt not forswear thyself."
But to this is added, "Eye for eye, hand for hand, foot for foot, wound
for wound, bruise for bruise." Such an enactment required a man not to
injure others; and supposing him to have sustained an injury, that his anger at
the wrong doer must not go beyond an equal retribution. But the general bearing
of the legal mode of life was by no means pleasing to God; it was even given to
those of old time as a schoolmaster, accustoming them by little and little to a
fitting righteousness, and leading them on gently to the possession of the
perfect good. For it is written, "To do what is just is the beginning of
the good way:" but finally, all perfection is in Christ, and His precepts.
"For to him that striketh thee. He saith, on the check, offer also the
other." In this there is pointed out to us the pathway to the highest
degree of patience. But He wills besides, that we pay no regard to riches; so
that even if a man have but one outer garment, he must not count it a thing
unendurable to put off with it also his undergarment, if it so befal. But this
is a virtue possible only for a mind entirely turned away from covetousness: for
"do not, He says, ask back whatever any one taketh away that is thine: but
even give to every one that asketh of thee:" a proof indeed of love and
willingness to be poor; and the compassionate man must necessarily also be
ready to forgive, so as to shew friendly acts even to his enemies. <a name="p113"><font color="#000000">|113</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

was probable however that the holy apostles would perchance think these things
difficult to put into practice: He therefore Who knoweth all things takes the
natural law of self-love as the arbiter of what any one would wish to obtain
from another. Shew thyself, He says, to others such as thou wishest them to be
towards thee. If thou wouldest have them harsh and unfeeling, fierce and
wrathful, revengeful and ill-disposed, shew thyself also such: but if on the
contrary thou wouldst have them kind and forgiving, do not think it a thing
intolerable to be thyself so. And in the case of those so disposed, the law is
perchance unnecessary, because God writes upon our hearts the knowledge of His
will: "for in those days, saith the Lord, I will surely give My laws into
their mind, and will write them on their heart."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

cuts away from our minds a very unmanageable passion, the commencement and
begetter of pride. For while it is men's duty to examine themselves, and to
order their conduct according to God's will, they leave this alone to busy
themselves with the affairs of others: and if they see any infirm, forgetting
as it seems their own frailties, they make it an excuse for faultfinding, and a
handle for calumny. For they condemn them, not knowing that being equally
afflicted with the same infirmities as those whom they censure, they condemn
themselves. For so also the most wise Paul writes, "for wherein thou
judgest the other, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest doest the
same things." And yet it were rather our duty to have compassion on the
infirm, as those who have been overcome by the assaults of the passions, <a name="p114"><font color="#000000">|114</font></a> and entangled without hope of escape in the meshes of sin,
and to pray in their behalf, and exhort them, and rouse them up unto soberness,
and endeavour ourselves not to fall into similar faults. "For he that
judgeth the brother, as the disciple of Christ saith, speaketh against the law,
and judgeth the law." For the lawgiver and judge is One: for the judge of
the sinning soul must be higher than that soul: but since them art not so, the
sinner will object to thee as judge, "why judgest thou thy
neighbour?" But if thou venture to condemn him. having no authority
thereto, it is thyself rather that will be condemned, inasmuch as the law
permits thee not to judge others.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

therefore is guided by good sense, does not look at the sins of others, nor
busies himself about the faults of his neighbour, but closely scans his own
misdoings. Such was the blessed Psalmist, falling down before God, and saying
on account of his own offences, "If Thou, O Lord, O Lord, closely
regardest iniquities, who can endure?" And once again, putting forward the
infirmity of human nature as an excuse, he supplicates for a not unreasonable
pardon, saying, "Remember that we are earth."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

parable He added as a most necessary appendage to what had been said. The
blessed disciples were about to be the initiators and teachers of the world: it
was necessary for them therefore to prove themselves possessed of every thing
requisite for piety: they must know the pathway of the evangelic mode of life,
and be workmen ready for every good work, and able to bestow upon
well-instructed hearers such correct and saving teaching as exactly represents
the truth. This they must do, as having already first received their sight, and
a mind illuminated with the divine light, lest they should be blind leaders of
the blind. For it is not possible for men enveloped in the darkness of
ignorance, to guide those who are afflicted in the same way into the knowledge of

overthrowing the vaunting passion of boastfulness, to which most men give way,
that they may not emulously strive <a name="p115"><font color="#000000">|115</font></a> to surpass their
teachers in honour, He added; "The disciple is not above his
teacher;" and even if some make such progress, as to attain to a virtue
that rivals that of their teachers, they will range themselves no higher than
their level, and be their imitators. And Paul shall again be our warrant,
saying, "Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of Christ." Since
therefore the Teacher as yet judgeth not, why judgeth thou? For He came not to
judge the world, but to shew pity. And according to the foregoing explanation,
if I, He says, judge not, neither must you the disciple. But if thou art guilty
of worse crimes than those for which thou judgest another, how canst thou keep

"And why, saith He, beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" Having previously
shewn us that the judging others is utterly wicked and dangerous, and the cause
of final condemnation:----for "Judge not, He said, and ye shall not be
judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned." He now by
conclusive arguments persuades us to avoid the very wish of judging others: and
rather to examine our own hearts, and try to free them from the passions that
dwell within them, and their frailties, by asking it of God: for He it is Who
healeth the broken in heart, and freeth us from the maladies of the soul. For
if thou, He says, art thyself sick with maladies more dangerous and severe than
those of others, why, neglecting thy own, dost thou find fault with them, and
whilst thou hast a beam in thine own eye, commencest a hot accusation against
those who have a mote? Tell me by what <a name="p117"><font color="#000000">|117</font></a> boldness doest
thou this? Deliver thyself first from thy great crimes, and thy rebellious
passions, and then thou mayest set him right who is guilty of but trifling
faults.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Wouldst
thou see the matter clearly and plainly, and that it is a very hateful thing
for men to give way to this feeling?<i> </i>Our Lord was once walking on the
sabbath day among the cornfields, and the blessed disciples plucked some ears,
and rubbing them in their hands, ate the grains. But some Pharisees drew near,
and say, "Behold, Thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on
sabbath days!" And yet they themselves in manifold ways were guilty of
disregarding the law altogether. For even the prophet Isaiah cried out against
them, saying, "How has the faithful city Zion become a harlot! It was full
of judgment; righteousness lodged in it:----but now murderers. Your silver is
reprobate; thy merchants mix the wine with water; thy princes are contentious,
the partners of thieves, loving bribes, pursuing after recompense; they judge
not the orphans, and to the widow's suit they have no regard." Yet these
very men, themselves liable to these most severe reproaches, accused the
disciples of breaking the sabbath!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
they met with just rebuke from Christ, Who said unto them; "Woe unto you,
scribes and pharisces, hypocrites! who tithe mint and cummin, and have
neglected the weighty matters of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith."
And again, "Ye are they who strain out a gnat, but gulp down a
camel." For while their teaching was of mere trifles, and they condemned
the people under them for the most contemptible matters, they had the
hardihood, as I said, to treat as of no consequence those weighty crimes. For
this reason the Saviour called them "whitened sepulchres, which outside
appear indeed to men to be beautiful, but inside are full of the bones of the
dead, and of all unclcanness."----And such is every hypocrite: and
whenever they would cast an imputation upon others, who have yielded to
infirmity in any particular, deservedly will they have it said to them,
"First cast out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou wilt see to
cast out the mote from thy brother's eye."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
commandment, therefore, is indispensable for every one <a name="p118"><font color="#000000">|118</font></a>
who would live piously: but, above all, for those who have been intrusted with
the instruction of others. For if they are good and sober-minded, and enamoured
of the elect life, and not merely acquainted with, but also practisers of
virtuous arts, and setting in their own conduct the pattern of a holy life,
they can with open countenance rebuke those who will not do the same, for not
having imitated their example, nor imprinted their virtuous manners on
themselves: but if they are careless, and quickly snared by pleasures to do
evil, how can they blame others when similarly affected? Wisely, therefore, did
the blessed disciples write, saying; "Let there not be many teachers among
you, my brethren: for ye know that we shall receive greater condemnation."
For as Christ, Who is the Distributor of the crowns, and the Punisher of those
who do wrong, Himself says; "He who shall do and teach, shall be called
great in the kingdom of heaven: but he who hath not done, but hath taught,
shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
I can imagine some one saying, How are we to distinguish the man who has a beam
in his eye, but finds fault with those who have a mote, and are infirm only in
part? But there is nothing difficult in this, He says; for any one who will, may
see it easily: "for it is not a good tree that brings forth evil fruit:
nor a good tree that brings forth good fruit: for every true is known by its
fruit." Each man's actual life, therefore, is that which decides what are
his morals: for it is not by mere outside adornments, and fictitious virtues
that the beauty of the truly honourable life is delineated, but by the deeds a
man does: for they are the fruits of a mind that for the love of piety chooses
a blameless life. It is by deeds, therefore, and not by outside shew, that we
must see who is the man truly approved, and who is not so. Again, Christ
somewhere says, "Beware of those who come to you in the likeness of sheep,
but within are ravenous wolves." See <a name="p119"><font color="#000000">|119</font></a> again, Christ
commands that those who come unto us must be distinguished not by their
clothing, but by what they really are. "For by its fruit, He says, the
tree is known:" and just as it is ignorance and folly for us to expect to
find the choicer kinds of fruits on thorns, grapes for instance, and figs; so
it is ridiculous for us to imagine that we can find in hypocrites and the
profane ought that is admirable, the nobleness, I mean, of virtue.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

thou see the truth of this again? Wouldst thou see who the wolves are that
clothe themselves in the sheep's skin? Examine the writings of the holy
Apostles: hear what they say of certain men: "For they who are such are
false Aposties: deceitful workers, transforming themselves into angels of
righteousness: and no wonder, for Satan even transforms himself into an angel
of light. It is no great thing, therefore, if his ministers also transform
themselves into angels of righteousness." These one may well call thorns
and briars: in such there is no particle of sweetness, but every thing that is
bitter and of an evil nature: for the fig grows not on thorns; nor will one
find any thing pleasant in them, for grapes are not produced on briars. We must
decide, then, the character of the teacher, not by appearances, but by the acts
of each one's life.</span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_03_sermons_26_38.htm#10" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>10</u></span></sup></a></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is "one Lord, one faith, one baptism," for so the wise Paul writeth.
For both the name of lordship, and also the reality, are appropriate solely to
that nature Which transcends all, and is supreme; even That Which is divine,
and to be worshipped, as possessing and governing all things. For so Paul again
somewhere says of Him; "For even, if there be Gods many and Lords many, in
heaven or in earth; yet for us there is one God, the Father, from Whom is all,
and we by Him: and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by Whom is all, and we by Him."
As therefore we acknowledge God the Word alone, Who reigneth with God the
Father, as by nature and verily Lord, we accordingly give this name to Him.
"But why, He asks, call ye Me indeed Lord, but do not the things which I
say?" For if He possess no real authority, nor glory of lordship, but, on
the contrary, it is conferred upon Him from without, and bestowed by favour, do
not offer Him thy obedience: refuse His service: consent not to be subject unto
Him. But if He be verily, and in its precise meaning Lord, and the whole nature
of things created bow beneath His sceptre, and as a thing set under the feet of
its Lord, then pay what is due: accept the yoke: and as being due, offer Him
thy obedience; that thou mayest not hear Him blaming thee in words spoken by
one of the holy prophets to them of old time; <a name="p122"><font color="#000000">|122</font></a> A son

and throw off the yoke of servitude; we make them humble by bonds and tortures

brethren of those who are bowed beneath the yoke, cannot tolerate them when
rebellious, how will God endure it;----He Whom principalities, thrones, and
lordships worship: in Whose presence the high-exalted Seraphs stand, readily
rendering their service? For the divine David somewhere says of them in the
Psalms; "Bless the Lord, all ye His angels, who hearken to the voice of
His words. Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts: His ministers, who do all of them
His pleasure."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is dangerous, therefore, and merits final condemnation, to be unwilling to
submit to Christ the Almighty: but those who prize His service, shall receive
the most excellent blessings. For<i> </i>He has said by one of the holy
prophets to those who run away from His yoke, and will not submit to be set
under His authority; "Behold, they that serve Me shall eat; but ye shall
suffer hunger: behold, they that serve Me shall drink; but ye shall suffer
thirst: behold, they that serve <a name="p123"><font color="#000000">|123</font></a> Me shall exult; but ye
shall mourn: behold, they that obey Me, shall be merry with joy; but ye shall
cry out for the grief of your heart, and howl for contrition of your
spirit." Thou seest that the crown of those who bear the yoke of servitude
is very beautiful, worthy of being acquired, and precious: while severe and
manifold condemnation is decreed against the rest.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
yet again in another place thou mayest see that the true servant is adorned
with surpassing honour, while the disobedient and careless is rejected with
disgrace, or rather is banished to the outer darkness. For they who received
the talents, and doubled for the owner what had been given them, were honoured
by him with praises: for he said to each one of them, "O good and faithful
servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many
things: enter the joy of thy lord." But him who hid in the ground what had
been given him, as not loving service and indolent, he condemned to severe and

there is yet another point which I think must be added to what has been already
said, namely, that by being willing <a name="p124"><font color="#000000">|124</font></a> to submit to our
Saviour's words and serve Him, we shall gain in return the honour of freedom by
His decree. For He said to those that believe in Him, "If ye abide in My
Word, ye are truly My disciples, and ye shall acknowledge the truth, and the
truth shall make you free." We gain therefore the glory of freedom by
subjection: that is, by servitude under Him. This makes us sons and heirs of
God, and fellow heirs with Christ: of which He again shall be thy proof, saying;
"that every one that doeth sin is the servant of sin: but the servant
abideth not in the house for ever. If therefore the Son make you free, ye are
really free."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
being willing therefore to serve is that which invites us to freedom, and the
honour which is the especial prerogative of sons: but disobedience humbles us
to a base and ignominious servitude, if it be true, as true certainly it is,
that "every one that doeth sin is the servant of sin."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
yes! says some one, obedience unto Christ's service is a most excellent thing,
and highly to be appreciated; but it is by no means an easy matter: for there
is much that stands in the way, and is able to exhaust our zeal. Yes, so say I
too:----for first of all Satan resists whatever is excellent:----and the flesh,
in its fondness for pleasure, strives against the Spirit, "for they are
contrary one to the other," according to the expression of the wise Paul:
and the law of sin that is in the members, savagely and very bitterly makes
opposition. For I know that Paul, who was instructed in the law, excellently
discusses these questions. For he said, "For I rejoice in the law of God
in the inner man: but I see another law warring against the law of the mind,
and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, that is in my members."
And again; "I therefore in my mind serve indeed the law of God, but in my
flesh the law of sin." And besides this, there is a certain powerful
inclination of the mind of man, which makes the will wander after pleasures:
and engenders the delights of worldly lusts, and leads it away from the wish to
labour in the cause of virtue. Shall we, therefore, on this account, refuse our
service? <a name="p125"><font color="#000000">|125</font></a> Is He ever seen to command ought that is
impossible, and that cannot be done? Does He demand of us anything that exceeds
the limits of our nature? And who would venture to say this?<i> </i>For
certainly He adapts to our minds whatever is commanded. When, therefore, thou
tellest me of the difficulty of obedience,</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">I 
tell thee also: Do those things that are great and excellent come of
themselves? or do those who seek to win them succeed without toil? or, on the
contrary, are they attained to by earnestness and labours? Who are the men that
in the conflicts of the palestra are accustomed to win the crown? Is it those who
have entirely devoted themselves to skill in the art of wrestling, and have
gone through bitter toils? for "they endure all things," according to
the expression of St. Paul: or, on the contrary, is it the indolent and
luxurious, and those entirely unacquainted with what is suitable for athletes?
Who of those that till the ground have their threshing-floor full of sheaves?<i>
</i>Is it such as neglect ploughing, and will not undertake the severe toil of
the mattock: or, on the contrary, is it the diligent and industrious, and such
as apply themselves to the labours necessary for ensuring a prolific crop?<i> </i>The
answer is known, even if no one speak it; that it is with those who are willing
to labour, and not with those whose wont it is to be at ease, that a life of happiness
is to be found, and nothing wanting for a tranquil existence. The Psalmist also
bears witness, in a passage where he makes mention of the tillers of the ground
as an exemplification of something else, "They went out, and that with
tears, carrying their seed: but they shall surely come with joy bringing their
sheaves." Joy therefore is the fruit of labour.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Moreover,
the Lord Himself somewhere quickens us for the love of exertion in every
praiseworthy pursuit, by saying, "Enter at the strait gate: because narrow
is the gate, and strait the way that leadeth unto life; but broad and wide is
that which leadeth down those that run thereon unto destruction." Observe
therefore that the end of that strait path leadeth unto life, while the easy
descent of the broad way sends men to the flame and never-ending torments.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">If
therefore we call Christ, the Saviour of us all. Lord, let us do the things
which He says. For He teaches us Himself what the benefit is of our being
willing to do that which is <a name="p126"><font color="#000000">|126</font></a> commanded: and what the loss
of our refusing to obey: for He says, "Every one that heareth My words and
doeth them, is like a man who builds a house, and firmly places its foundations
upon the rock:" while he who does not obey, he also is like a man building
a house, but who has taken no care for its stability. For he who is obedient
and tractable holds a thoroughly firm position in every thing that is
honourable and good, by reason of his being not so much a hearer of the law, as
a doer of its works: he resembles therefore a house firmly settled, and having
a foundation that cannot be shaken, so that, even though temptations press upon
him, and the savageness of the passions that dwell within us assail him like
some winter torrent, or a waterflood, he will sustain no serious loss. But he
who merely inclines his ear to what Christ saith, but stores nothing up in his
mind, nor performs anything that is commanded, he, on the other hand, is like a
house just ready to fall. For he will be led away at once into things unseemly
whenever pleasure allures him, and leads him into the pitfalls of sin.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

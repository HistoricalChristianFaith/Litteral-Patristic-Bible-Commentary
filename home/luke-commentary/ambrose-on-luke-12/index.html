has introduced here a very beautiful passage on the guard of sincerity and zeal

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">we (Rom.,
II, 15), will reveal the intimate of our souls. Is it greater encouragement to
sincerity than to let everyone know that there can be no retreat for deception?
But since two causes engender bad faith, which is born or of a malice or an
accidental fear of fear, fear that the terror and the terror of the power does
not force someone to deny the God that he recognizes in his heart, It adds by
the way that only the punishment of the soul is redoubtable, that corporal
punishment is not to be feared - death is the term of nature, not a punishment
- and therefore death ends to bodily torment, while the punishment of the soul
is eternal; and that it is necessary to fear God alone, against the power of
which nature does not prescribe, this same nature being submitted to Him; as
for death, it is not frightening, since immortality will compensate for it with
usury. The Lord had inspired a disposition of sincerity. He had raised the
energy of the soul. Only confidence hesitated. He fortified it by humble
examples; for if God is not forgetful of sparrows, how could He be men? Now, if
the majesty of God is so great and so eternal that a sparrow, or the number of
our hair, is not exempt from the knowledge of God, what indignity to believe
that the Lord ignores or disdains the hearts of the faithful. who knows the
most humble things! Someone may say, how did the Apostle say,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Does
God worry about oxen? (I Cor., IX, 9) while an ox is certainly more expensive
than a passerine. But something else is worry, something else knowledge.
Moreover, the number of the hair intervenes not for counting them, but for the
facility to know them: for God does not apply his care to count them in a
careful watch; but, knowing all things, all things are counted for him. It is
fair to say, counted, because we count on what we want to keep. Here, however,
we can penetrate the secret of a spiritual sense, especially since it seems
absurd to compare men with sparrows rather than men. These five sparrows,
indeed, seem to be the five senses of the body: touch, smell, taste, sight,
hearing. If, in the manner of sparrows, they scour the dirt of the garbage of
the earth and seek their food in uncultivated and smelly places, retained in
the nets of their faults they can not resume their flight towards the fruits of
the high works20, which are the feast of souls. Seductive voluptuousness has
its manner of net, which encloses the steps of our souls with its stitches; if
the flame, the vigor, and the purity of our nature are dulled by terrestrial
and material sensibility, it sells us at the price of the luxury of this world,
and puts us in the auction of vices. There is also a market of our faults:
thus, captured by the bait of divers pleasures, we are either sold to sin or
redeemed from sin. Christ redeems us, the adversary sells us: one puts on sale
for death, the other buys to save. So Matthew was right to write: two sparrows
(X, 29), to signify the body and the soul: for if the flesh itself, docile to
the law of God and disengaging itself from the law from sin, takes the nature
of the soul by the purity of the senses, it ascends to heaven by spiritual
wings. We thus learn that the faculty of flying has been given to us by nature,
delighted by pleasure, which appeases the soul by the bait of evil, and reduces
it to the heavy nature of the body. And He rightly said that none of them fall
without the will of God: for what falls goes to the earth, and what is stolen
is carried to the top of immortality. And so that no one was uncertain about
what Matthew said, Luke clearly explained it: the will of God is his knowledge.
No one indeed falls by the will of God; but he who is carried away by the
weight of his faults can not hide himself from God. For Job, too, is tempted by
his will: He has given you an adversary, but He has offered you a reward. And
do not belittle your weakness; because you have the image, you have received a bulwark.
So well, and it is to your advantage and salutary to know that without the
permission of God the devil can not harm; so you will not fear the power of the
devil rather than the displeasure of divinity. Now there is no doubt that the
soul is compared to the sparrow, since you have read: "Our soul, like a
sparrow, has been torn from the net of hunters" (Ps. 123, 7); and
elsewhere: "How do you say to my soul, flee to the mountains like the
sparrow" (Psalm 10: 2)? The man himself, we read, is also compared to the
sparrow, for it is written, "To me I am like the lonely sparrow on the
house" (Ps. is constituted by the union of two sparrows in one, that is to
say by the assembly of two wings agreeing in the agility of the spiritual
substance. There is therefore the good sparrow, able by nature to fly.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> There
is also the bad sparrow, who has lost the habit of stealing by the fault of the
earthly taint: such are the sparrows who sell two aces. Sometimes they sell an
ace, sometimes double (see Matt, X, 29, Lc, XII, 6). How little are the sins
worth! for death is common, virtue has price. The adversary in fact exposes us
for sale as captive slaves and puts us at a low price; but the Lord has treated
us as beautiful servants, whom he has made in his image and likeness, and,
enjoying his work as a connoisseur, redeemed us at great expense, as the holy
Apostle says:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"You
have been paid dearly" (I Cor. VI, 20). Yes Dear ; we have not calculated
in money, but in blood: for Christ died for us; He liberated us with his
precious blood, as St. Peter again reminds us, when he writes to us in his
epistle: "It was not by silver or perishable gold that you were redeemed
from vain. the existence which your fathers bequeathed to you, but by a
precious blood, being that of the unblemished and undefiled Lamb, Christ Jesus
"(I Peter, I, 18); yes, precious, since it is the blood of an unblemished
body, since it is the blood of the Son of God, who has redeemed us not only
from the curse of the Law (Gal., III, 13), but still of the definite death of
impiety.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

short, the meaning is this: if the Lord has provided humble birds and
unfaithful men either by raising the sun or by fertilizing the earth, if He
grants to all the benefit of His mercy, we do not would doubt that the
consideration of the merits of the faithful will be powerful in his eyes. He has
admirably built and honed our faith, and furnished to this very faith the
foundation of virtues: for if faith is the stimulant of virtue, virtue makes
the solidity of faith.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

certainly hear through the Son of Man Christ, who was begotten of the Holy
Spirit and the Virgin, for his only author on earth is the Virgin. Would the
Holy Spirit be greater than Christ, so that those who sin against Christ will
obtain forgiveness, while those who miss the Holy Spirit do not deserve to
obtain forgiveness? But where there is unity of power, there is no question of
comparing, there is no discussion of greatness, since the Lord is great and his
greatness can have no limit (Ps 144, 3 ). If, then, as we believe, there is
unity in the Trinity, there is no more distinction of grandeur than there is a
distinction of activity. The following shows this: because, having said
elsewhere: "The Father gives you what you must say" (Matt., X, 19ff),
He added: "For the Holy Spirit will give you on the hour what to say. If
therefore the activity is one, one too is the offense. But back to our subject.
Some believe that they must hear the same Christ by the Son of Man as by the
Holy Spirit, subject to the distinction of persons and the unity of substance,
because the one Christ, God and man, is also spirit, as it is written,
"The spirit that precedes us is Christ the Lord" (Lam. IV, 20). He is
also holy: for just as the Father is God and the Son Lord, and the Father Lord
and the Son God, so is the Father holy, and the Son holy, and the Holy Spirit.
Thus the cherubim and the seraphim cry, without wearied their voices:
"Holy, holy, holy" (Is., VI, 3), to signify the Trinity by the triple
resumption of this invocation. So if Christ is one and the other, what
difference is there? Is it not a question of letting us know that we are not
allowed to deny the divinity of Christ? In the time of persecution we are
asked, if not to deny that Christ is God? So whoever does not confess that God
is in Christ, and that Christ is of God and in God, does not obtain
forgiveness. But also "every spirit that does not confess that Christ came
in the flesh, is not of God" (I Jn, IV, 2 ssq.): For to deny his humanity
is to deny his divinity, since Christ is God in man, and man in God. Many,
however, prefer to say that the unforgivable blasphemy consists in saying that
Christ drives out demons from Beelzebub, not by virtue of divine power.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">All this
passage is ordered to the acceptance of suffering to confess the Lord, either
by contempt for death, or by hope of reward, or under the threat of lasting
punishment, to which it will never be granted. And as it often happens that it
is greed that tempts virtue, so too is the commandment and example to suppress
it, when the Lord says, "Who made me judge or dispatcher among you? He has
the object of discarding the earthly, having descended for the divine things;
and He does not deign to be judge of disputes and arbiter of riches, having to
judge the living and the dead and to decide on the merits. It is therefore
necessary to consider not what you ask, but which you solicit, and not to
believe that a mind applied to great things can be unduly annoyed. It is
therefore not without reason that this brother, who claimed to occupy
perishable goods the dispenser of heavenly goods, is rejected, whereas among
brothers it is not through the intermediary of a judge, but at the affection to
mediate and distribute the patrimony. Besides, it is the heritage of
immortality, not money, that we must seek: for it is useless to amass wealth
without knowing whether it will be used: such as the one whose granaries filled
with crispness under the new harvest and who prepared stores for this abundance
of crops, without knowing for whom he was gathering (Ps. 38, 7). For we leave
in the world all that is in the world, and we see all that we amass for our
heirs escape; we do not have what we can not carry with us. Only virtue accompanies
the deceased, only mercy follows us, who, leading us and preceding the abodes
of heaven, acquires to the dead, at the price of a mean money, the eternal
tabernacles: witnesses the precepts of the Lord, who tells us: "Make
friends with the riches of iniquity, that they may welcome you into everlasting
tabernacles" (Lk 16: 9). This, then, is a good and salutary precept,
capable of animating the misers themselves to take care to exchange the
perishable for the eternal, the terrestrial for the divine. But as devotion is
often hindered by the weakness of faith, and when giving up one's heritage one
is held back by the preoccupation with living, the Lord adds these words:
"Do not worry about your life eating. nor for your body of clothing. Life
is more than food, and the body is clothing. Nothing in reality is better done
to give confidence to those who believe that God can grant everything, that
this breath of air prolonging the vital union of the soul and body associates
and spouses, without work on our part and the resource of healthful food is
scarce only when the supreme day of death has arrived. Then, since the soul is
clothed with the body's envelope, and the body animated by the energy of the
soul, it is absurd to believe that the means of living will be lacking, when we
have the permanent reality of life . "Consider," he says, "the
birds of the sky. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Great
example, for sure, and worthy of being imitated by faith. For if the birds of
the sky, who in no way exercise agriculture, who do not reap the copious
harvests, receive without fault from the divine providence their food, we must
really see in avarice the cause of our poverty. . For if they have in abundance
the resources of a pasture that does not come from their work, it is because
they do not know how to claim as special property the fruits given to them for
the food of all, instead of lost the commons by claiming properties; nothing is
the property of any one, since nothing is durable, and there is no assured
provision when the outcome is uncertain. Why consider wealth as yours, when God
wanted you to live it with other animals? The birds of the sky do not claim
anything for them especially, and that is why they ignore the food shortage,
not knowing how to envy others. "Consider the lilies as they grow
up"; and, lower down: "But if the grass, which is there today and is
thrown into the fire tomorrow, is so clothed by God ..." Good word and
good human: by the comparison of the flower and grass, the Lord's speech has
invited us to trust that God will grant us His mercy: according to the letter,
because we can not add anything to the size of our body, that is, in the
spiritual sense, because we can not go beyond the measure of our size without
the favor of God. What is there, indeed, as much to persuade as to see even
those without reason so well clothed by the providence of God that they lack
nothing that embellishes and adorns them? All the more must you believe that
the reasonable man, if he relies upon God for all his needs and does not give
up trust by daring to doubt, can never fail, rightly counting on divine favor.
However, it is necessary to examine all this more thoroughly: for it does not
seem indifferent that the flower is compared to the man himself, or even placed
almost above the men personified by Solomon, who had the privilege of building
a temple to the Lord. according to appearances, or, according to the mystery,
to represent the Church of Christ. It does not therefore seem out of place to
think that the brilliant color represents the glory of the angels of heaven;
they are really the flowers of this world, because the world is adorned with
their brightness, and they spread the good odor of sanctification. With their
help, we can say, "We are the good odor of Christ among those who are
saved" (II Cor., II, 15).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Not being
hindered by any solicitude, not being agitated by any necessity to work, they
retain in them the benefit of the divine liberality and the gifts of the
heavenly nature. So it is with good reason that Solomon is shown to us, here
clothed with his glory, elsewhere (Matt., VI, 29) covered, because he covered
in a way the weakness of his bodily nature by the force of the the soul, and
clothed her with the splendor of her works: instead of the angels, whose
nature, which is nearer to God, remains free from all bodily suffering, no
matter how great a man may be, they are justly favored by reason of our
infirmity. Then, then, that by the resurrection men will be like angels in
heaven, the Lord, citing the example of the angels, commanded us to hope for
the enrichment of the heavenly glory, He who granted it to them also until this
mortality is absorbed by life; for "this corruption must be made
incorruptible, and this mortality be immortality" (I Cor. Many consider
this comparison particularly happy, in view of the nature of the flower and the
manners of the plant in question. Lilies do not need to be cared for and grown
every year; there is no similarity between the harvesting of other fruits and
the production of this flower: work does not come back every season to the
concern of farmers. Whatever the drought of the country, all that develops is
impelled to flourish by the native virtue of a sap which comes from them and
always remains in them. So when you see the stem of the adult leaves withered,
the nature of the flower is yet vivid: its greenness is hidden, not dead; but
as soon as she is awakened by the caresses of spring, she resumes the garment
of the buds, the hair of the flower, or the adornment of the lily. As we
remember to have treated elsewhere this passage more along, it will suffice to
have touched it, not to return on the same things. I am pleased to note that
lilies are not born on steep mountains or in uncultivated forests, but in
gardens. For there are fruit gardens, those of various virtues; as it is
written: "It is a walled garden that my sister and wife: an enclosed
garden, a sealed fountain" (Cant., IV, 12); for where there is purity,
chastity, religion, the assured silences of retreat, where there is the light of
the angels, there are the violets of the confessors, the lilies of the virgins,
the roses of the martyrs. And no one must find it inappropriate for the lilies
to be compared to the angels, since Christ himself recalls that he is a lily:
"I am, he says, the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys"
(Cant., II, 1). And it is a lily that Christ; for where is the blood of the
martyrs, there is the Christ, who is the slender, unblemished, innocent flower,
which does not wound by the sharpness of the thorns, but shines with a
flourishing of beauty. For the roses have thorns, because the martyrs have
their torments; but the intangible divinity has no thorns, having not felt the
torments. If, therefore, the lilies, or the angels, are clothed beyond all human
beauty, we must not despair of the mercy of God upon us also, since the Lord
promises us, by the grace of the resurrection, an appearance similar to that of
the angels. In this place He seems to touch on this question, which the Apostle
has not omitted: the people here below ask how the dead are raised (I Cor. XV,
35) and with what body they come back. For, saying, "Seek the Kingdom of
God, and all this will be given to you in addition," He shows that grace
will not fail believers for the present or the future, provided that, desiring
the Divine, they do not seek the terrestrial. To trouble oneself with food
really befits men who serve the Kingdom. The King knows how to feed, feed,
clothe his house; so he said, "Throw in God your concern, and it is He who
will feed you" (Ps 54, 23).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

He has kept us vigilant, waiting at all times for the coming of the Lord

general precept; but the theme of the following comparison seems to be proposed
to the bishops, that is to say, to the bishops, to let them know that they will
have to undergo a severe punishment later, if, occupied with the pleasures of
the century, they neglected to govern the house of the Lord and the people
entrusted to them. But as the profit is thin, and the merit is low, when it is
the fear of the punishment which prevents from going astray, since the charity
and the love have a superior dignity, the Lord sharpens our zeal to deserve its
favor and we are inflamed with the desire to acquire God, saying, "I have
come to set fire to the earth," not certainly the fire that consumes the
goods, but the one that produces the good will, which makes the vases of and
from the house of the Lord, consuming the hay and the straw (I Cor. iii.
12ff.), devouring all the gangue of the age, amassed by worldly pleasure, the
work of the flesh that is to perish; this divine fire, which set the flame on
the bones of the prophets, as Jeremiah the saint says: "It has become like
a burning fire that burns in my bones" (Jer. XX, 9). For there is a fire
from the Lord, of which it has been said, "A fire shall burn before
him" (Ps 96: 3). The Lord is also a fire, as He Himself says: "I am
the fire that burns without consuming" (Ex., III, 2, XXIV, 17, Deut, IV,
24, Hebrews, XII, 29): for the fire of the Lord is the eternal light; it is to
this fire that the lamps of which He said above are lighted: "Let your
loins be girded, and your lamps burning. Because the days of this life are
night, a lamp is necessary. This fire, Ammaus23 and Cleopas testify that the
Lord put them in them also, when they say: "Did not we have a burning
heart on the road when it revealed to us the Scriptures" (Lk. 32)? They
have thus taught with evidentness what is the action of this fire, which
enlightens the intimate of the heart. For this reason perhaps the Lord will
come into the fire (see Is., LXVI, 15; 16): to consume all the vices at the
moment of the resurrection, to fill by his presence the desires of each one,
and to project the light on merits and mysteries.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is the condescension of the Lord that he testifies to having at heart to spread
in us the devotion, to complete in us the perfection, and to hasten for us his
Passion. Having no pain in Him, yet He was anguished with our troubles, and at
the moment of death let us see a sadness which he had not conceived for fear of
his death, but because of the delay of our redemption, as it is written,
"What is my anguish until it is fulfilled! Certainly He who is distressed
to the point of completion is assured of fulfillment. But still elsewhere:
"My soul," says He, "is sad until death" (Matt. Xxvi. 38).
It is not because of death, but until death, that the Lord is sad, being
affected by the conditions of bodily sensibility, not by the terror of death.
For having taken a body He had to undergo all that belongs to the body, to be
hungry and thirsty, to be anguished and sad; but the divinity can not be
modified by these impressions. At the same time He shows that in the struggle
with suffering, bodily death is deliverance from torture, not paroxysm of pain.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

all passages of the Gospel the spiritual sense intervenes. Yet it is now
especially, not to be put off by the harshness of the simplistic explanation,
that there is reason to associate spiritual depth with the web of meaning; all
the more so because holy religion, by the humanity of its teachings and its
amiable examples of affection, gently inclines the very exiles of the faith to bear
it with the least respect; by the prior education of the faith she tames and
dispels hardened prejudices, and brings the captive minds of error to the
discipline of faith, when she has been able to win them by goodness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">When
indeed weak hearts can not grasp the depths of faith, what is commanded makes
one judge of what to worship; the righteousness of the righteous, the sanctity
of the saint testify how good is the Author of their goodness. When then the
Lord has gathered in one and the same recommendation reverence towards God and
the benefit of kindness, saying, "You will love the Lord your God"
and "you will love your neighbor", will we believe it changed to the
point of to abolish the bases of relations, to oppose the feelings of affection
between them? Will we believe that he commanded the disunity between his dear
sons? How, then, is He "our peace, who has brought the two together in
one" (Ephesians II, 14)? How He says He himself: "I give you my
peace, I leave you my peace" (Jn, XIV, 27), if he came to separate the
fathers from their sons, the sons of their fathers, by dissolving their
connections ? How is one "cursed if one does not honor one's father"
(Deut., XXVII, 16), religious if one abandons it? But if we take care that the
affair of religion comes in the first place, that of piety25 second, we will
judge that this very question becomes clear: you must in fact pass the human
after the divine. For if we have to give homework to the parents, how much more
to the father of the parents, to whom you must be grateful to your parents
themselves? Or, if they do not recognize their Father at all, how will you
recognize them? He does not therefore say that we must renounce the objects of
affection, but prefer God to all. Besides, you find in another book, "Who
loves his father or his mother more than me, is not worthy of me" (Matt.
X. 37). It is forbidden for you not to love your parents, but to prefer them to
God: for the relations of nature are blessings of the Lord, and no one should
love the benefit received more than God, who preserves the benefit received
from Him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So even in
the literal sense, those who understand with piety are not devoid of a
religious explanation. But here is what to make us think that we must seek a
deeper meaning; because He added:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"From
now on in the same house five will be divided: three will take sides against
two, and two against three. What are these five then, when six people are then
named: father and son, mother and daughter, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?
It is true that one can identify mother and mother-in-law, because the one who
is the mother of a son is the mother-in-law of his wife, so that even literally
the number is not incorrectly calculated. And it is clear that faith is not
captive of ties of nature, since, even in the duties of piety, one is free by
faith. Moreover, it does not seem superfluous to resolve this meaning by
mystical interpretation. The unique house is man in his unity: for each is a
dwelling place, or of God, or of the devil. Thus the spiritual dwelling is the
spiritual man, as we read in the Epistle of Peter: "And you, as living
stones, are spiritually dwelling for a holy priesthood" (I Peter, II, 5).
In this house so two are opposed to three, three to two. Two, we often read that
it is the soul and the body; and if two agree on earth (Matt. xviii. 19), of
the two he made one (Ephes. II, 14). And elsewhere: "I chasten my body and
the contrains to serve" (I Cor., IX, 27); another is what serves, other
than the one to whom one is subjected. Having recognized both, let's also
recognize the three: it's easy to understand from these two. For the soul in
the body has three dispositions, one reasonable, another concupiscible, the
third irascible: in other words? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?,? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?,? ?
? ? ? ?. There will be no opposition of two against two, but of two against
three, and of three against two; because, thanks to the coming of Christ, the
man, who was deprived of reason, became reasonable. Previously we were like
animals that ignore reason; we were carnal, we were earthly, according to the
sentence: "You are earth, and to the earth you will go" (Gen., III,
19). The Son of God has come, He has sent His Spirit into our hearts (Gal. Iv.
6), we have become the sons of the Spirit. We can say that in this house are
five others, namely smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing. If, therefore, by
reason of what we hear or read, the senses of sight and hearing, we cut off the
superfluous pleasures of the body, which are engendered by taste, touch, and
smell, we Let us oppose two to three: for the mind is not made to be caught by
the bait of vices, but to tend to virtue by tearing itself from the caresses of
pleasure. There is therefore no agreement of all to precipitate in misguidance,
but opposition and separation of the desires of the heart and the duties of
virtue. Or, if we hear it from the five senses of the body, then the vices and
sins of the body stand apart. Perhaps also the five are those who, in the
Gospel (Lk. XVI, 23 ff.), Are called his brothers by the rich party-boy who is
shown to be tortured in hell, and implores that we warn them to renounce
delights in this century, so that their virtuous efforts may find rest after
this century. One can also consider the body and the soul, separated from the
sense of smell, touch and the taste of lust, opposing in the same house the
vices that assail them, the body and the soul submitting to the law from God,
departing from the law of sin. Although their disagreement became nature by the
prevarication of the first man, so that they never got along in a common effort
towards virtue, however, the cross of the Lord having removed enmities as the
law of precepts (Ephes II, 14-16), they came together and joined in concord,
after Christ our peace, descending from heaven, "united the two in one,
and destroyed the wall of enmities that separated them, abolishing in his flesh
the law of the ordinances and the prescriptions, to make of them one new man,
making peace and reconciling the one and the other in the same body with God
"(Ib). What are these two, if not the inside on the one hand, the outside
on the other? One concerns the vigor of the soul, the other relates to bodily
sensibility: although they agree in the inseparable unison of their feelings,
when the flesh, subject to its superior, obeys his orders salutary. It is not
that she takes the nature of the soul, whose subtlety penetrates matter; but,
renouncing the delights, purified of all defilement of vices, she enters the
way of a celestial life by the love of obedience; it no longer resists, as
formerly, the law of the soul, but, delivered, by the law of the soul and by
the Spirit of life, from the law of sin, the flesh becomes the complement of
the soul: she is no longer the matchmaker of vices, but the imitator and the
next of virtue. So also the soul does not lend itself to the bait of the body
and does not succumb to the charm of the carnal pleasures, but pure and free
from the servitudes of this world, it wins and attracts the bodily senses to its
own pleasures, so that the a habit of hearing and reading the nourishment of an
increase of virtue and the satisfaction of the spiritual food whose intimate
vigor will make it ignore hunger. In fact, wisdom is the nourishment of the
soul: an admirable feast of sweetness, which does not weigh down the limbs and
is not transformed into ignominy, but into adornment of nature. Then the
quagmire of passions changes into a temple of God, and the receptacle of vices
begins to be the sanctuary of virtues. This is what happens when the flesh,
returning to its naturalness, recognizes that which nourishes its vigor, and,
renouncing the temerity of pride, marries the judgment of the soul which rules
it. Such was her state when she received the retreats of paradise for abode,
before, spoiled by the venom of the fatal snake, she knew no sacrilegious
hunger, and did not go beyond, in her desire to eat, to the remembrance of the
divine precepts which remained attached to the senses of the soul. It is from
there, we are revealed, that sin has come, whose body and soul are like
parents, the bodily nature being tempted, the soul having a morbid compassion
for it. If it had curbed the greed of the body, the source of sin would have
been dried up at its very birth; the body made it pass into the soul as if by
an act of virility: the soul was impregnated with it, its very vigor was
corrupted, and, weighed down by this foreign burden, she bore it. For violent
and strong sex is carried away by the powerful impulse of virile passion; the
other applies to keeping a gentle attitude rather than a violent one. It is
therefore through them that the movement of various desires has grown. But as
soon as it returns to itself, the soul is seized with shame by its hideous
posterity, denies its degenerate heirs, renounces passions, takes abhorrence of
sin. The flesh itself, crushed under the debt of hard work and exhausted by the
duration of its lamentable misfortune, when she groaned to be pierced by the
lusts she herself bore, as by the world's thickets is anxious to deprive the
old man of evading herself, so as not to be, like an improvident mother,
betrayed by her posterity ready to perish. In the same way, the unreasonable
movement of lusts, attracting it by the lures of pleasure as well as by the
beauty of a certain appearance, is as united as it is to live in society;
likewise voluptuousness, a sort of mother-in-law of the body and soul, marries
the movement of perverse lust.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> As
long as the unison of vices, an indivisible and inseparable agreement,
persisted in the same house, there was no division. But when Christ brought to
the earth the fire of which He would consume the faults of the flesh, or the
sword, which signifies the cutting edge of the power that is exercised, and
which "penetrates the intimacy of the spirit and the marrow." (Hebr.,
IV, 12), then flesh and soul, renewed by the mysteries of regeneration,
forgetting what they were, beginning to be what they were not, separating from
the company of the old vice so loved that he was until then, and break all
connection with their prodigal posterity. Thus the parents are divided against
the children, the movement of intemperance being denied by the temperance of
the body and the soul avoiding the trade of the fault, while there is no room
for this foreigner, coming from without, the voluptuousness . The children are
also divided against the parents, when the inveterate vices are concealed from
the senile censorship of the renewed man, and the young voluptuousness so far
escapes the discipline of a serious house. And nothing forbids thinking that
those too are separating who want to become better than their parents,
especially since lower He said: "If one comes to me without hating father
and mother, son, brothers and sisters, and even his life, one can not be my
disciple "(Lk, XIV, 26). Thus, according to the obvious interpretation,
the son who follows Christ has the advantage over the pagan parents: for
religion prevails over the duties of affection.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> Other
meaning, deeper. Sin is born of the flesh, and acts, so to speak, in the bosom
of the flesh; which makes the Apostle say: "If I do what I do not want, it
is no longer I who do it, but the sin that dwells in me" (Rom. VII, 20).
When, shed for the life of this world, the blood of the Lord has exterminated
the vices, there is a passage from disgrace to grace - for sin has overflowed
so that grace is overabundant (Rom., V, 20) - and it turns out that repentance
born of sin causes one to change one's life and to desire spiritual grace: thus
that which was mortal to me will be my salvation (see Rom., VII, 10). So the
sin, washed by the waters of the fountain, is separated from the flesh of which
it was begotten, and, each desiring to repair his sin, the fault results in the
zeal to be disciplined. In turn, the covetousness of evil things and that kind
of passionate, burning desire is transposed by the word of God into the greed
of charity and divine love; nature is the same, the conduct has changed; and
this desire for body and soul gives a pleasure much preferable to the preceding
one: that of celestial mysteries. For the mind is nourished by the knowledge of
things, and transported to learn the promise of future goods, it disgusts the
old works of the soul; for "the animal man does not understand what is the
Spirit of God: for him it is madness; but the spiritual judge of all, and is
judged by no one "(I Cor., II, 14ffq).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

also noted this; but one specifies, the other speaks in general. One thought
that it was a question of bringing back peace between brothers in disagreement,
the other of repentance and the amendment of all sin. Let's find out who the
adversary is, who the magistrate is, who judges him, who the appariteur, what,
in our opinion, is the money that must be paid under pain of being thrown into
prison. But according to Matthew the adversary is the one with whom it seems
that you have not agreed at all in this life, and who, before the judge to come
of the dead and the living, will bring against you the accusation of a constant
disagreement. According to Luke, on the contrary, our adversary is especially
one who disposes of the bait for sins, in order to share his torment with those
he associates with his misguidance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> He
seeks companions in sin, to denounce them as punishable. It is he whose Apostle
Peter warns us to keep, when he says: "Our adversary the devil, like a
rapacious and roaring lion, seeks to devour" (I Peter, V, 8). Our
adversary, according to Matthew, is the whole practice of virtue, the words of
the Apostles and the Prophets, which binds us to painful commandments and to
the lessons of an austere life; it is good for us to get along with him and to
imitate him by our works, lest our stubbornness be denounced as having broken
with him. According to Luke, on the contrary, no one is our adversary more than
our fall, which accuses us of the proofs of our life: not that the future judge
needs the ministry of any accuser, but because before the witness of all things
our activity accuses us, when it is foreign to the practice of virtue and
apostolic precepts. Thus our adversary is all vicious habit, our adversary is
passion; adversity greed, adversary any perversity, adversary any iniquitous
thought, all the bad conscience finally, which troubles us here below and later
will accuse and denounce us, as the Apostle testifies when he says: "Their
conscience testifying to them and their thoughts blaming or defending one
another "(Rom., II, 15). What if the conscience of each one denounces it,
how much more is the result of our acts present before God! Translated into our
body, it will be evaluated on the last day, and the intimate of our thoughts
will be read in our hearts. So let us take care, while we are in the course of
this life, to free ourselves from our evil activity as a bad opponent, lest
going with the adversary to the magistrate, he condemns our misguidance on the
way. So he says again, according to Matthew: "Agree with your adversary
while you are with him on the way. The Greek said:? ? ? ? ? that is to say,
benevolent: for if we free ourselves from the devil in this life, he will not
be condemned because of us, and we will be removed from his bonds. It is for
this reason that the seventy-ninth psalm bears the title: for the Assyrian28.
It is indeed true that you take care of your adversary, and that you work for
this Assyrian, in other words vain, if by freeing you from his traps you do him
this service to make escape the punishment of your fall and your death. If you
remain in his bonds, he will deliver you as guilty to the magistrate, accuser
at the same time as a traitor. Who is the magistrate, except the One in whom
all power resides and who claims for Him the supreme dignity of the complete
and finished time, to whom the Holy Prophet hastens, leaning on the conscience
of his good deeds and without fear of the adversary: "My soul," he
says, "is thirsty for the living God; when will I come before the face of
God "(Ps.41,3)? It is indeed this magistrate who will return the culprit
to the judge, to Him, I say, to whom He has put power over the living and the
dead. And He gave it by nature, not by grace: He did not receive it as not
having it, but drew it from the substance of the Father when He was begotten.
Here is the magistrate and the judge that shows you the one who showed the
accuser; and it shows when He will be revealed: "In the day, is it said,
where God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, through our
Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom., II, 16). This judge, therefore, is Jesus Christ,
through whom are repeated secret faults and inflicted the punishment of evil
deeds. You want to know that Christ is this judge who delivers to the executor
and throws in prison? question him; or rather read what he says in the Gospel:
"Take it and cast it into darkness outside" (Matt. xxxiii. 13). He
also showed his executioners in another passage, where He says, "It will
be the same at the end of time: the angels will come to separate the wicked
from the righteous, and throw them into the blazing furnace. weeping and
gnashing of teeth "(Matt, XIII, 49ffq). It remains to be seen now what the
figure of the obole means. And it seems that the name of this familiar object
expresses the mystery of a spiritual sense. Indeed, as one pays his debt by
returning the money, and as the title to the interest is extinguished only when
the whole amount of the capital is paid until the last denier, whatever the
mode of payment, of it is by the compensation of charity and other works, or by
some satisfaction, that the penalty of sin is extinguished. Nor is it without
reason that he did not mention in this place, as elsewhere, two pieces of
copper (Lc, XXI, 2), an ace (Matt., X, 29), nor a denier (Ib., XX, 2), but an
obole; for the transfer of an obole29 is a kind of exchange, where one puts one
thing in sign of the acquittal of another. Likewise here: either the wrong is
redeemed at the price of charity, or the punishment diminished according to the
appreciation of the wrong. Now it is the custom, as we remember, to give a bath
to the baths: by presenting it, everyone obtains the faculty of bathing there;
so, here, to be purified, because the sin of each is purified by the kind of
transaction described above. On the other hand, the guilty person is tortured
and tortured as long as he has not served the sentence of the error committed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Galileans, whose blood Pilate has mingled with their sacrifices, it seems that
there is a figure against those who, under the impulse of the devil, do not
offer their sacrifice with purity. Their prayer turns into sin (Psalm 108: 7),

the Lord's blood in the very midst of the sacrifice.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

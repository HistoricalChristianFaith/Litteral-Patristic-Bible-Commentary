1-4. Preamble</strong></font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"As
many have undertaken Luc to compose a relationship of events. Many things with
us have the same origins and the same causes as those of the ancient Jews:
similar episodes take place at the same pace, with the same outcome; the events
correspond from beginning to end. In fact, there have been many prophets in
this people animated by the Spirit of God; others, on the other hand, claimed
to prophesy and betrayed their commitments by their lies: they were false
prophets and not prophets: such as Anania, son of Azot (Jer., XXVIII, 1). Now
this people had the gift of discerning spirits: so he knew those whom he was to
put among the number of prophets and those whom, like an expert changer, he
must reject as facts of a coarse, dull metal, having no not the brilliance and
brilliance of true light. Thus, nowadays, in the New Covenant, many have
undertaken to write gospels that the experienced money-changers have not
approved: one of them, written in four books, has seemed worthy to be retained.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">There is
another gospel, which is said to be written by the Twelve. Basilides also did
not fear to write one called the Gospel according to Basilides. We are talking
about another one, called the Gospel according to Thomas. I know another one
attributed to Mathias 1. We read some of them so that we do not read them; we
have read them not to ignore them; we have read them not to retain them, but to
reject them and to know what is the heart of these boasters.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Yet the
Church, with the four evangelical books she possesses, fills the universe of
her evangelists; with all their books, heresies do not have one.
"Many," indeed, "have undertaken", but they lacked the
grace of God. Several have collected in a compilation what in the four Gospels
seemed to them conformable to their poisoned doctrines. Thus the Church has
only one gospel and teaches one God; while those who distinguish a God from the
Old Testament and a God of the New 2 have established with the help of multiple
gospels not one God, but many.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"As
many have undertaken. Of course, those who could not finish were taken. Many,
therefore, have begun, but not yet finished: S. Luke furnishes us in his turn
an explicit testimony, when he tells us that many have undertaken. The one who
undertook to compose it undertook by a personal effort, and did not succeed.
There is no effort in the gifts and grace of God: when it spreads in a place,
it is used to so well water that in the mind of the writer, sterility gives way
to the abundance. No effort at Matthew, no effort at Marc, no effort at Jean,
no effort at Luc; but largely provided by the divine Spirit of everything:
words and facts, they have without any expenditure of effort carried out their
enterprise.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He is
therefore right to say: "As many have begun to compose a relationship of
events that have happened at home," or: "which abound in us."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Abundance
leaves nothing to be desired; and as to the fulfillment, no one doubts it, for
the result is proof of it, the end is proof of it. Thus the Gospel is completed
and it spreads over all the faithful of the whole world, watering all the
intelligences, strengthening all the hearts. He who, built on stone, has
received with the fullness of faith an unshakable constancy, is entitled to
say: "What has been accomplished in us"; for it is not miracles and
wonders; it is intelligence that discerns truth from falsehood from those who
recount what the Lord has done for our salvation or who apply their hearts to
his wonders. Is it not so reasonable, when one reads that things are superior
to man, than to attribute them to a superior nature and, when there are signs
of mortality, to to see the affections of the body that has been coated? It is
therefore intelligence and reason, not miracles, which serve as the basis of
our faith.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"As
we have transmitted those who, from the beginning, have themselves seen and
served the word. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This
phrase should not lead us to believe that speech is served rather than heard.
It is not a spoken word, but a substantial Word that "became flesh and
dwelt among us" (Jn, I, 14). So it is not, let us understand it, of any
word, but of this divine Word, that the Apostles were the ministers. However,
it is read in the Exodus that "the people saw the voice of the Lord"
(Ex., XX, 18); now it is clear that the voice is not visible but is heard; what
is the voice? a sound, which does not fall under the eyes, but the ear
perceives. Yet it is a profound thought that has determined Moses to affirm
that we see the voice of God: in the heart of the soul a look contemplates it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But in the
Gospel it is not a voice that is seen; it is what is superior to the voice, the
Word. So the evangelist St. John says, "That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard and seen, beheld with our eyes, and touched with our hands
the Word of life; for the Life is manifested, and we have seen it, and we
testify to it, and we announce to you the Life that was with the Father and
manifested itself to us "(I Jn, I, 1 sqq.).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As you can
see, the Word of God was seen as well as understood by the Apostles. They saw
the Lord, not only in his body but even as a Word; they saw the Word, those who
with Moses and Elijah saw the glory of the Word (Matt. XVII, 3). They saw
Jesus, who saw him in his glory, not the others, who could only see his body:
for it is not given to the eyes of the body, but to those of the soul, to see
Jesus. The Jews did not see him while seeing him. Abraham saw it, for it is
written, "Abraham saw my day and rejoiced" (Jn, VIII, 56). So Abraham
saw it, and yet it is certain that he did not see the Lord in his body. But to
see him in the spirit is to see him corporally; on the contrary, to see him
bodily without seeing him in spirit, is not even to see corporally what one
seems to see. Isaiah saw it and, as he saw it in spirit, he saw it also in his
body. Does he not say, "He had neither appearance nor beauty" (Is.,
LIII, 2)? The Jews did not see it: "Their foolish heart was blinded"
(Rom., I, 21). He, himself, testifies that the Jews could not see him:
"Blind guides," said he, "you filter the gnat, and the camel
swallows it! (Matt., XXIII, 24). Pilate did not see him. They did not see him,
those who shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him! "For if they had seen
it, they would never have crucified the sovereign Lord" (I Cor., II, 8).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">To see God
is therefore to see the Emmanuel, to see God with us. Whoever has not seen God
with us has not been able to see Him whom a Virgin has given birth to. Also
those who did not believe him Son of God did not believe him any more Son of a
Virgin.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What is it
to see God? Do not ask me; ask the gospel, ask the Lord Himself; or rather,
listen to him: "Philip," said he, "he who saw me saw the Father
who sent me.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">How can
you say: Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and
that the Father is in me? "(Jn, XIV, 9-10). Not that we see the bodies one
in the other, or the spirits one in the other; but this Father is the only one
who is seen in his Son, as this Son in his Father. One does not see one in the
other, indeed, dissimilar characters; but as long as there is unity of
operation and activity, we see both the Son in the Father and the Father in the
Son. "The works that I do," says He, "He too fulfills them"
(Jn, V, 19). We see Jesus in his works; in the works of the Son we also see the
Father. We saw Jesus on seeing the mystery he performed in Galilee (Jn, II, 9);
for no one but the Master of the world can transform the elements. I see Jesus
when I read that he smeared the eyes of the blind man with mud and gave him
sight (Jn, IX, 6): I recognize here the one who made the man mud and gave him
the breath of life, light to see. I see Jesus when He forgives sins; for
"no one can forgive sins save God alone" (Mk, II, 5, 7). I see Jesus
when He raises Lazarus, and the eyewitnesses did not see him. I see Jesus, I
see the Father also when I lift my eyes to the sky, when I turn them towards
the sea, when I bring them back to the earth; because "his invisible
perfections are seen and grasped by means of created objects" (Rom., I,
20).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"As
we have transmitted those who, from the beginning, have seen and served the

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
perfect man has a dual faculty of intention and execution. Of these two
faculties, the holy evangelist does honor to the Apostles: not only, he says,
they have seen the Word, but they have served it. The intention relates to the
vision, to the performance the service; but the term of the intention is the
execution, and the principle of the execution is the intention. And to use the
very example of the Apostles, Peter and Andrew intended it when hearing the
Lord say to them, "I will make you fishers of men" (Matt. IV, 19),
without any postponement. they left their boat, followed the Word. But the
execution is not simultaneous to the intention. In the same way there is not
yet execution, but intention, when Peter says, "Lord, why can not I follow
you now? I will give my life for you "(Jn, XIII, 37); the intention of the
martyrdom was there, but not yet the execution, although it was already
realized by the fasts, the vigils, by the contempt of the pleasures of the
senses: because it is there the Christianity in action.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In fact,
it is far from the fact that in all things the intention and the execution are
simultaneous: what is the execution of a thing is still only intentional in
relation to another. This same Peter had already posed with constancy and
energy many apostle's acts; yet it was later, when the Lord had said to him,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"You,
follow me" (Jn, XXI, 22), take his cross, follow the Word, and know the
reality of martyrdom.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But let us
suppose that, in Peter, Andrew, John, and among the other Apostles, the
execution was commensurate with the intention. It is none the less true that
sometimes the intention exceeds the execution, or the execution the intention.
It is the difference that the gospel shows us between Saint Mary and Saint
Martha: for one listened to the word, the other was eager to serve: "She
stopped and said: Lord, you do not take care let her alone do the service! tell
him then to help me. And he said to him, Martha, Martha, Mary chose the best
portion, which will not be taken from her. (Lc, X, 40-42.) Thus predominance in
one of loving attention, in the other of activity to be served. Yet in both of
them there was the zeal of these two exercises: if Martha herself had not heard
the Word, she would not have put herself at his service; his activity is the
sign of his attention; and as for Mary, she was so well consummated in the one
and the other virtue that she was given to embalm the feet of Jesus, to wipe
them with his hair and to fill the whole house with the perfume of his faith
(Jn, XII, 3).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It
sometimes even happens that the application is very large, the execution
sterile: so we will take care of</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> medicine,
we will know all the medical rules and we will not apply them, so that the
sterility of the realization will lead to that of the study. In some, on the
other hand, the act may be richer, the look more puny: such as he who receives
the sacrament of baptism, but does not wish to apply himself to knowing the
rules of the various virtues; often this negligence in attention causes the
fruit of the act to be lost.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> We
must therefore seek the fullness of both virtues. The attainment was given to
the Apostles, of whom it is said: "Those who from the beginning have seen
and served. They have seen: by this means the application to know God; they
served: thus their activity is expressed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Note:

attentive gaze, contemplation, study.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Action

seemed good to me. He may not have been the only one to find good what he
declares to have seemed good to him; no, the will of man was not alone in
finding it good, but such was the good pleasure of "He who speaks in me,
the Christ" (II Cor., XIII, 3), which makes that what is good can also
seem good to us. He calls him whose mercy he takes. Therefore whoever follows
Christ can, if asked why he wanted to be a Christian, answer: "It seemed
good to me"; in speaking thus, he does not deny that God found him good:
"It is God, indeed, who prepares the human will" (Prov., VIII, 35
according to the Septuagint). If God is honored by a saint, it is God's grace.
As well, many wanted to write the gospel; but only four, having obtained the
grace of God, have been approved.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"He
seemed good to me after having applied himself to knowing exactly everything
from the beginning and in order. This gospel is more extensive than the others:
no one could doubt it. So he does not claim the false, but the true. Besides,
he deserved that the Apostle Paul himself bore witness to its accuracy; Here is
his eulogy of Luke: "The gospel is praise to him of all the churches"
(II Cor., VIII,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">18). It is
certainly worthy of praise for having deserved to be praised by the great
Doctor of the nations. He therefore sought to know, he said, not a little, but
everything; and when he became acquainted with everything, it seemed good to
him to write not everything, but an excerpt from it all: for he did not write
everything, but he knew everything:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"If

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">You will
note again that he deliberately omitted what was written by the others. Thus
the gospel shines with varied charms, and each book has its miracles, its
mysteries, its own actions which distinguish it. Have not the soldiers shared
the garments of Christ, as we will explain further in his place?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This
gospel was written for Theophilus, that is, for the one who is loved by God. If
you love God, it is for you that it is written; if it is for you that it is
written, welcome this present of the evangelist, keep with care in the heart of
your heart this memory of a friend, "keep this precious deposit by the
Holy Spirit who has been given "(II Tim., I, 14); look at him frequently,
examine him often. Fidelity is the first duty towards a deposit; then the care,
so that this deposit is not eaten by ringworm or rust: because what you have
been entrusted with can be eaten away. The gospel is a precious deposit, but
beware that it is gnawed in your heart by ringworm or rust. It is eaten away by
ringworm, if, having read correctly, you believe badly. The ringworm is the
heretic, the ringworm is Photin, your ringworm yours, it's Arius. It is to
slash clothing that separate the Word of God. Photin lacer clothing, when he
reads: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was in God, and God
was" (Jn, 1,1); the integrity of the garment demands that one reads:
"And the Word was God. It is to slash clothing that separate from God the
Christ. If one reads, "Eternal life is to know you, you only true God"
(Jn, XVII, 3): one must also know Christ, because to know the Father alone as
truly God, it is not is not all eternal life; but to know also Christ as true
God, truth of truth, God of God, that is the life without end. It is to be
ringworm to know Christ without believing in his divinity or in the mystery of
his body. Arius moth, Sabellius moth! These moths attack the floating spirits,
these moths attack the mind which does not believe that the Father and the Son
are one by the deity. One tears what is written: "My Father and I are
one" (Jn, X, 30), if we divide this unit into distinct substances. This
ringworm attacks the mind which does not believe that Jesus Christ came in the
flesh, and he is ringworm himself, for he is an antichrist (I Jn, IV, 2 sqq.).
Those on the contrary who are of God preserve the faith and therefore can not
know the ringworm that gnaws the garment. All that is divided in itself, like
the kingdom of Satan, can not last forever. There is also a rust of the heart:
the spots of earthly lusts blunt attention to holy things, or the purity of
faith is altered by the mist of error. The rust of the soul is the desire of
riches; the rust of the soul is negligence; the rust of the soul is the passion
of honors, if we place in these goods all the hope of the present life. Let us
turn then to the things of God, sharpen our spirit, let us exercise our love,
to keep always ready, always bright, hidden, so to speak, in the scabbard of
the soul, the sword for the purchase of which the Lord order to sell the
garment (Lc, XXII, 36). For spiritual weapons, "powerful in the eyes of
God to overthrow, strongholds" (II Cor., X, 4), must always be within
reach of the soldiers of Christ, lest upon his arrival the leader of the
militia Heavenly, shocked by the bad state of our arms, does not exclude us
from the ranks of his legions.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Divine
Scripture teaches us that among those who deserve praise it is fitting to
praise not only their manners, but also their parents; so it is in the manner
of a transmitted inheritance that a spotless purity will distinguish those whom
we want to celebrate. In fact, what is the sacred evangelist aiming for here?
Does he not want to claim for St. John the Baptist the nobility of parents,
prodigies, life, function, martyrdom? Thus is celebrated Anne, mother of Samuel
the saint, that Isaac received from his parents the nobility of piety, then
bequeathed it to his descendants.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So
Zachariah is a priest, and not only a priest, but also of Abia's class, which
distinguishes him from the oldest families. "And his wife, it is said, was
of Aaron's lineage. So it is not only to his parents but to his ancestors that
the nobility of St. John goes back, not enhanced by the power of this world,
but venerable by a religious lineage. Such ancestors were needed by the herald
of Christ: thus would he preach, not for having suddenly conceived it, but as
having received from his ancestors, as infused by right of birth, faith in the
coming of the Lord.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"They
were both righteous, behaving according to all the commandments and
prescriptions of the Lord, without reproach. What will those who, seeking
excuse for their sins, think that man can not remain without sin frequently,
and use this verse, which is written in Job: "No one is free from
defilement, not even he has only one day of life; and on earth he still has
many months to go through "(Job, XIV, 4, Septuagint)? Here is how to
answer them: first, that they specify what it means to be without sin; has it
absolutely never sinned, or stopped sinning? If they think that to be without
sin, it is to have stopped sinning, I am of their opinion, because "all
have sinned and need the glory of God" (Rom., III, 23). But if they deny
that having corrected their old errors to pass to a kind of life where sin is
avoided, we can abstain from failures, I can not agree with their opinion; for
we read that "the Lord loved the Church to the point of presenting it to
Himself glorious, without spot or wrinkle, nor anything like it, but holy and
immaculate" (Ephesians 5: 25,27). For the Church being recruited among the
Gentiles, therefore among the sinners, how, made of defiled, can it be
immaculate, if not because first the grace of God has purified it of sin, and
then because imposing a life without sin, she protects herself from mistakes?
Thus it is not from the beginning unblemished - it is impossible for human
nature - but by the grace of God and by his kind of life, no longer sinning, it
comes to appear without spot.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And it is
not without reason that they are said "righteous before God, behaving
according to the commandments and regulations of the Lord," which implies
the Almighty Father and the Son. It is the Son who brought the Law, imposed the
precepts: in turn the holy evangelist declares it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> And
it is fitting to say "righteous before God": for those who are
righteous before man are not all equally righteous before God. Other is the
gaze of men, other than that of God; men see the face, God the heart (I Sam.,
XVI, 7, Septuagint). And so it may happen that such, who seeks the good graces
of the popular, seems to me just and not to be so before God, if his justice is
not the act of a simple soul, but is feigned by adulation; hides in it, man can
not disentangle it. The perfect merit is therefore to be right before God,
which makes the Apostle say: "His praise does not come from men, but from
God. (Rom., II, 29.) Blessed truly, he who in the sight of God is just; happy
he from whom the Lord deigns to say: "Behold, a true Israelite, in whom
there is no dissimulation" (Jn, I, 47): for the true Israelite is the one
who sees God, who knows that God sees him and who reveals to him the secrets of
his heart. One is truly perfect only if one is recognized by the One who can not
be deceived; for "the judgments of the Lord are true" (Ps. 18, 9) and
the judgments of men are often wrong, to the point that they often attribute to
the unjust the merit of justice, while the just is pursued for their hatred or
dirty with their lies. "The Lord Himself knows the ways of men without
blemish" (Ps. 36, 18); He does not take for a sinner the one who is
commendable, nor the laudable sinner, but judges each one to the measure of the
merits which belong to him; He appreciates both thought and act. Divine
judgments measure the merit of the righteous to the dispositions of his soul,
not to the result as such of his acts; for often the good intention is
disfigured by leading to a reprehensible act, while a bad thought is veiled by
the beautiful appearance of an act. But the very good that you may have done,
the divine judgment, if your calculation was perverse, can not approve it; for
it is written, "You rightly pursue what is right" (Deut., XVI, 20);
now, if it were not possible to do an unfair act, it would never have been
said: "You rightly pursue what is right. And indeed the Savior Himself has
taught us that one can do a righteous act justly, saying, "When you give
alms, do not blow the trumpet before you" (Matt. VI, 2). and "when
you pray, do not be like hypocrites" (Ib.t 5). It is good that mercy is a
good thing than prayer; but it can be done unjustly, if it is by gloriole that
one gives to the poor to be seen by men.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So
the holy evangelist says that they were not only "just before God and behaving
according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord," but also
behaving "without reproach." This fits perfectly with the prophetic
word used by Solomon the saint in the Proverbs:</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Watch,"
he says, "to do well always before God and men" (Prov., III, 4). One
is therefore without reproach when there is agreement between the goodness of
the intention and that of the act. Often, too stiff justice excites the complaints
of men.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But note
carefully about the choice of words, the suitability of their order: "They
behaved, it is said, according to all the commandments and prescriptions of the
Lord. In the first place the command; then justification: thus, when we obey
the heavenly commandments, we walk according to the commandments of the Lord;
when we judge and judge properly, it appears that we are observing the
righteousness of the Lord.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
therefore a complete eulogy that embraces race, conduct, function, activity,
judgment: race by ancestors, conduct by equity, function by priesthood,
activity by the commandment, and by justice the judgment.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
it came to pass, as Zacharias fulfilled the priestly office according to the
turn of his class, according to the custom of the priests, that fate appointed
him to offer incense upon entering the temple of the Lord; and all the people
were praying outside at the hour of incense. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It seems
that here S. Zachary is indicated as sovereign pontiff: for this one, as we
read, of the first tabernacle in which the priests continually entered to
perform their functions, passed once a year only in the temple: "In the
second sanctuary, once a year, the only high priest (penetrates), and with the
blood that he offers for himself and for the faults of the people "(Heb.,
IX, 7). This is the supreme priest who is still asked for fate, because we are
still unaware of the true one: if he is drawn by lot, it is because human
judgment can not discern it. This is the one we were looking for and another
was the figure. The one sought after is the true and eternal priest, to whom it
is said:</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"You
are a priest for eternity" (Psalm 109: 4): He who, not by the blood of the
victims, but by his own blood, was to reconcile his Father, God, with the human
race. But then the blood was shed in the figure, in the figure the priest was
ordained; now that the truth has come, let's face it, let's follow the truth.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So
also there was a turn, now it's perpetuity. There was, yes definitely there was
someone who was taking the place.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> Thus,
the priest who entered the temple was drawn. And if, in the time of the
figures, no one could assist him, was it not a sign that a priest would come
whose sacrifice would not be common to others: He who would not sacrifice for
us in temples made of man's hand, but in the temple of his body would eliminate
our sins?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So we drew
lots for the priest. It is for this reason perhaps that the soldiers drew lots
of the Lord's clothes (Lk. XXIII, 34): for the Lord was ready to present for us
in his temple his sacrifice, and for him also the recourse to the lot had to
fulfill the precept of the Law (that is why he said, "I came not to
destroy the Law, but to fulfill it"): one would see by this that it was He
who was waiting for it Old Testament and that designated the choice of God.
Moreover, on the apostle Mathias also the fate has fallen, so that the choice
of an apostle would not seem to disagree with the precept of the old law.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
an angel appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense."
It is not without reason that the angel appears in the temple: finally is
announced the coming of the true priest and prepares the heavenly sacrifice of
which the angels will serve.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And it is
said that he appeared to him who suddenly perceived him. Besides, it is the
special turn which is loved for use by angels, or for God the divine Scripture,

"God appeared to Abraham near the yam of Mamre" (Gen., XVIII, 1). The
one that was not hinted until then but suddenly becomes visible is deemed to
appear. In fact, we do not see in the same way the sensible objects and the
object of the will from which it depends on being seen, the nature of which is
such that we do not see it, the will we see it; for if he does not want it, one
does not see it; if he wants to, we see him. God appeared to Abraham because he
wanted it; to another, unwilling, He did not appear. In the same way, Stephen,
being stoned by the people, saw the sky open; he also saw Jesus standing at the
right hand of God (Acts, vii. 55), and the people did not see him. Isaiah saw
the Lord of Hosts (Is., VI, 1), but no one else could see him, because he
appeared to whom he pleased Him.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But why
speak of men, when we read about the virtues and celestial powers themselves
that "no one has ever seen God" (Jn, I, 18)? And we add, which
exceeds the heavenly powers: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom
of the Father, has revealed Himself to us" (Ib.). It is therefore necessary
to admit, if no one has ever seen God the Father, that it is the Son who has
shown himself in the Old Testament, and the heretics must renounce to make him
begin from the Virgin, and then -Before being born of the Virgin II was shown.
In any case, it can not be denied that the Father, or the Son, or even the Holy
Spirit, if the Holy Spirit is visible, manifest themselves according to the
appearance chosen by their will and not shaped by their nature, since The Holy
Spirit himself, as we know, was shown in the form of a dove. And if no one has
ever seen God, it is because the fullness of the divinity that dwells in God
has not been perceived by anyone: no one has grasped it by thought or sight;
because "has seen" must be understood of both. As well, adding: "The
only-begotten Son Himself revealed it", it is the souls rather than the
bodies whose eyes are indicated: the appearance is seen, the power is revealed;
one is grasped by the eyes, the other by the soul.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But why
speak of the Trinity? The Seraphin appeared when he wanted to, and Isaiah alone
heard his voice (Is., VI, 6). The angel also appeared, he is there at the
moment, but we do not see him; for it is not in our power to see it, but in its
power to appear. Yet, if we do not have the power to see it, grace is there to get
us the means to see it. So he who had grace has obtained this faculty; we do
not get this faculty because we do not have the grace to see God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And what
is so surprising if, in this world, the Lord is only seen when he wants it? At
the resurrection itself It is given to see God only to those who have a pure
heart; also "blessed are the pure ones, for they are the ones who will see
God" (Matt, V, 8). How many blessed people had already listed! And yet He
had not promised them the faculty of seeing God. If therefore those who are
pure-hearted will see God, surely others will not see it: for the unworthy will
not see God, and whoever does not want to see God can not see God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is not
in a place that we see God, but by a pure heart. It is not the eyes of the body
that seek God; He is not embraced by the gaze, nor touched, nor heard in
conversation, nor recognized by his approach. It is believed to be absent, we
see it; He is present, and we do not see him. Besides, even the Apostles did
not see Christ; so says II: "For so long that I am with you, you do not
know me yet" (Jn, XIV, 9)! Whoever has indeed known "what is breadth
and length and height and depth, and superior to knowledge, the charity of
Christ" (Ephesians 3: 18-19), he also saw the Christ, saw also the Father.
For we are no longer according to the flesh that we know Christ (II Cor., V,
16), but according to the spirit: "The spirit that is before us is the
Lord Christ." (Lam., IV, 20, Septuagint): may he deign, in his mercy, to
fill us with all the fullness of God, that we may see him!</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If, then,
the angel appeared to Zechariah, "to the right of the altar of
incense", it is because he appeared when he wanted to, and did not appear
so much as he did not want to.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> Now
he appeared to the right of the altar of incense because he brought the mark of
divine mercy; for "the Lord is on my right hand so that I will not be
shaken" (Psalm 15: 8), and elsewhere: "The Lord is your protection on
your right hand" (Psalm 120: 5). And it pleases God that we too, when we
incense altars, when we present the sacrifices, we are assisted by the angel,
or better than he makes himself visible! For there can be no doubt that the
angel is there when Christ is slain; "For it is Christ who was sacrificed
as our Passover" (I Cor., V, 7).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

afraid that your heart will be troubled at the sight of the angel? for we are
troubled and out of our senses when we are seized by the meeting of some higher
power? this same angel who comes to us may strengthen us, as he has confirmed
the troubled soul of Zechariah at first, saying to him, "Do not be afraid,
Zachariah, for here is your prayer answered, and your wife Elizabeth will give
birth to a son. and you will give him John's name; it will be a joy for you,
and many will rejoice at its birth. ". The divine benefits are always

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is also
a warning to parents to give thanks for birth no less than the merits of their
sons: for God does not make a mediocre present when he grants the children who
will continue the race, the heirs who will succeed. Read how Jacob rejoices at
having begotten his twelve sons. Abraham receives a son, Zechariah is granted:
it is therefore a gift of God that the fertility of parents. As the fathers
give thanks for having begotten, the sons of having been begotten, the mothers
of the honorable reward of marriage, for their children are the pay of their
service. May the earth flourish in praise of God because it is cultivated, the
world because it is known, the Church because the number of the faithful people
increases.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And it is
not in vain that, from the beginning of Genesis, the order of God creates the
bond of marriage: is it not to ruin heresy? God has so well approved marriage
that he has made the link; He has so well rewarded that when infertility denied
children, the goodness of God has granted them. "And he will be great
before the Lord. It is not the body, but the soul, whose greatness is here
announced. There is in the sight of the Lord a greatness of the soul, a
greatness of virtue; there is also a smallness of the soul and a childhood of
virtue. For the soul as for the body we calculate the ages, not on the basis of
time, but according to the degree of virtue: man does, shall we say, is the one
who is exempt from the errors of childhood and does not experience plus the
inconstancy of adolescence, his soul being at maturity; on the contrary, that
which has not yet been seen to make any progress in virtue. Hence the text of
Jeremiah, when the Lord takes pity on Ephraim crying and lamenting his sins:
"From my youth," he says, "Ephraim is my beloved son, a child in
his enjoyments" (Jer. XXXI, 20) For if he had not been a child in his
enjoyments, he would never have sinned. And he said the two things well: in
enjoyments, and child; there is the child who does not sin: "Here is my
child whom I have chosen" (Is., XLIII, 10). So it was by enjoyment that
sinned whom the Lord had formed ignorant of error. If, therefore, he had not
been a child in enjoyment, and if he had grown and grown old by virtue of being
a man, he would never have fallen, nor would he have needed to beg for
forgiveness. of his faults, having rather reason to hope for the reward of his
merits. This is still what the Lord seems to express in the Gospel, when He
says: "Beware of despising one of these little ones" (Matt. Xviii.
10): but reserve the surplus for this place.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So the
little is opposed to the big one; and since, according to the Apostle, the
little one is under the elements - "as long as we were children, we were under
the elements of this world" (Gal., IV, 3) - the great surpass therefore
the elements of the world. Thus John will be great, not by bodily strength, but
by greatness of soul. He has not retreated the frontiers of some empire, he has
not aspired to some triumph with the spoils conquered by war; but, what is
greater, preaching in the desert, he has overthrown the human enjoyments and
the softness of the flesh by the greatness and strength of his soul. He was
therefore small according to the world, great in spirit. Finally, since he was
tall, even life could not hold him to his lures: the desire to live did not
make him change the firmness of his sentence.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">There is
no doubt that this promise of the angel is true, since St. John, before he was
born, still living in the bosom of his mother, manifested the benefit of the
Spirit which he had received. In fact, while neither his father nor his mother
had performed any marvel before, while shuddering in his mother's breast he
announced the coming of the Lord. That's what you read: when the Lord's Mother
came to Elizabeth,</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">she said
to him, "Behold, when your salvation reached my ears, the child shuddered
in my bosom"; he did not yet have the spirit of life, but the Spirit of
grace. As well we have seen elsewhere the reality of life preceded by grace
which sanctifies, since the Lord said:</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Before
forming you in the womb, I knew you, and before you came out of the womb, I
sanctified you and made you a prophet among the peoples" (Jer., I, 5).
Another is the spirit of this life, other than that of grace: he takes his
principle at birth, expires at death; it is not limited by time or age, nor
extinguished by death, nor hatched from the maternal breast. As Saint Mary,
filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, Elisha revived the dead body of a dead
man in contact with his body (II Kings, XIII, 21), and Samuel, already dead,
did not, in the testimony of the Scripture, kept silent about the future (I
Sam., XXVIII, 16 ff.) 34. "And he will be filled with the Holy
Spirit": to whom has the Spirit of grace nothing is lacking, and whoever
receives the Holy Spirit has the fullness of the greatest virtues. Finally, it
is said, "He will bring many children of Israel back to the Lord their
God." That St. John has converted many hearts, the certificates are not
lacking. On this point we have the support of the scriptures, prophetic and
evangelical; for "a voice cries out in the wilderness, prepare the way to
the Lord, straighten out his paths" (Is. xl. 3), and the search for
baptism by the crowds shows that there was a considerable movement of
conversions among the people. . Now, believing in John, we believed in Christ:
for it is not He himself, but the Lord preached by the Precursor of Christ.
Also "he will precede the presence of the Lord in the spirit and with the
virtue of Elijah". Happy rapprochement: for there is never a spirit
without virtue or virtue without a spirit. Perhaps also "in the spirit and
with the virtue of Elijah" because Elijah the saint possessed a great
virtue and grace: virtue to divert from impiety to faith the soul of the
peoples, virtue of abstinence and patience, and spirit of prophecy. Elijah was
in the desert, John in the desert; This one was fed by the crows, the latter,
in the thickets, repressed all the attractions of pleasure, preferred austerity
and despised luxury. One did not seek the favor of King Ahab, the other
disdained that of Herod. One has separated the waters of the Jordan, the other
has made a bath savior. He lives with the Lord on earth, he appears with the
Lord in glory. This precedes the first advent of the Lord, the latter the
second. One has made the rain fall on the ground for three years dried up, the
other after three years bathed the earth of our body waters of faith. You will
ask me: what are these three years?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

it is said, three years that I come to seek fruit on this fig tree and I can
not find it" (Lc, XIII, 7). A mysterious number was needed to give
salvation to the people: one year for the patriarchs - for finally the harvest
of men of that year was such that it never was since on earth - another for
Moses and the the rest of the prophets, the third at the coming of the Lord and
Savior: "This is the favorable year of the Lord and the day of the
reward" (Lk IV, 19). In the same way the father of a family who had
planted a vineyard did not send once to collect the fruits, but very often: he
sent first servants, a second time other servants, third his Son .</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> John
therefore came in the spirit and with the virtue of Elijah, because one can not
go without the other, as we will see later, when it will be said: "The
Holy Spirit will come upon you and the virtue of the Most High will overshadow
you "(Lk, I, 35).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But perhaps
this passage concerns us and concerns the Apostles. For when Elijah shared the
flow (He Kings II, 14), the return of the waters of the river to their source -
according to the scripture: "The Jordan went back" (Ps 113: 5) -
meant the coming mysteries of the saving bath, by which the baptized are, like
children, brought back from evil to their primordial nature. Why does the Lord
Himself promise His Apostles to grant them the virtue of the Spirit? "You
will receive," he says, "virtue through the coming into you of the
Holy Spirit" (Acts, 1, 8), and in the sequel "there was suddenly a
noise coming from heaven, like a breath carried away with great power
"(Act, II, 2); yes, great power, for "it is the breath of his lips
that has made all their strength" (Ps 32, 6), and this force is that which
the Apostles received from the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is also
true that St. John will walk before the Lord, precursor by birth and precursor
by his death. And perhaps this mystery is fulfilled even today in our present
life. There is a virtue of John which comes first in our soul, when we are
ready to believe in Christ, to prepare for the faith the paths of our soul and
make the tortuous trail of this life the straight paths of our lives.
pilgrimage, lest we fall into some ravine of error: so that all the valleys of
our souls may be filled with fruits of virtue, and all elevation of the
dignities of this world will prostrate themselves before the Lord in humble
fear, knowing that nothing can be bred of what is fragile.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
Zachariah said to the angel, How shall I know it? I am old, and my wife is
advanced in age. And the angel answered him, saying, I am the angel Gabriel,

announcement to you. And you will be silent, unable to speak until the day when
all this will happen, for not wanting to believe my word, which will be
fulfilled in its time. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The lack
of faith of the priest is punished by silence, and the faith of the prophets
attested by their word. "Shout," he said. And I said: What to cry?
All flesh is grass "(Is., XL, 6). You see the order given, the eagerness
to obey, the attitude that questions, the obedience that makes the oracle. He
believed when he asked for shouting and, because he believed, he prophesied.
But Zechariah, not believing, could not speak, but "he made signs to them
and he remained silent". This mystery is not for one, nor for one,
silence. The priest is silent, the prophet is silent. If I am not mistaken, in
one, it is the voice of all the people who is silent, since one was all the
people who spoke to God by Moses. The cessation of sacrifices and the silence
of the prophets are the muteness of the prophet and the silence of the priest.
"I will take away, it is said, the powerful virtue, the prophet and the
counselor" (Is., III, 1, 3). And indeed he took away the prophets from
them by taking away the word that used to speak in the prophets, and indeed he
took away their virtue when the virtue of God withdrew from them; he took away
their counselor when "the Angel of the great council" (Is., IX, 6)
left them; he has taken away their voice, for the voice is for the word, not
the word for the voice, and if that word does not work in us, the voice makes
no sound. The voice is John, "voice crying in the desert"; Christ is
the word: it is this word that acts, and from then on, when it has ceased to
act, suddenly silent and deprived of inspiration, the language of the soul, so
to speak, is silent. The Word of God has come to us and in us is not silent;
the Jew can no longer say what the Christian can say: "You seek to put to
the test the One who speaks in me, the Christ" (II Cor., XIII, 3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Zechariah
therefore remained silent, and he made signs to them. What is the sign, if not
a gesture of the body without speech, which endeavors to indicate but does not
express the will? It is, when the approaches to death have made the word go,
the silent language of the dying. Do not you think that sounds like the people
of the Jews? He is so unreasonable as to be unable to explain his actions;
having reached the ultimate obliteration of the hope that made him live, he
lost the word he had and, by the gestures of a shaky body, he would like to
formulate the sign of the word, not the word. Mute, then, is this people,
without reason, without words. Why indeed look at the one who can not speak as
more dumb than the one who ignores the mystery? There is certainly a language
of works and a cry of faith, according to what we read: "The blood of your
brother cries to me" (Gen., IV, 10). And he cries out, who in his heart
cries all day long (Ps 87: 10). Whoever has lost the cry of the heart has lost
that of the tongue: for if one does not keep the discernment of the faith, how
can one keep the word? Moses had said at first that he could not speak; but
after having said it, he received the word and spread the brightness of his
good works. Thus, as Moses was a figure of the people and a figure of the Law,
so too Zachariah was silent.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> It
is necessary to notice the convenience of every detail: the word exists in the
breast, the law is silent; John is appointed and Zachariah speaks; the word is
uttered, the law is loosed; but the deliverance of the law is the expression of
the word: so he who spoke the word speaks, even if he did not speak before.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The angel
orders Zechariah to be silent, the angel removes the word from the Jews:
because it is an order of authority not human but divine, that no one speaks to
God if he does not believe in Christ. So believe in order to speak; that the
Jew believes in order to speak. Let's talk spiritually about mysteries;
understand the meaning of ancient sacrifices, the riddles of the prophets. No
one who does not understand the Law is dumb, who is silent and does not
understand the sequence of Divine Scriptures; because our voice is our faith.
So, "I would rather say to the assembly five words with my intelligence,
in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in language" (I Cor.,
XIV, 19); because languages ​​"are a sign not for believers but for
unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers"

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The saints
have a great concern for the reserve, to the point that they often feel the
modesty of their desires. This is what we notice here for St. Elizabeth: she
certainly wanted to have children, she is hidden for five months. Why hide, if
not out of modesty?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is that
for each function it is an assigned age; what befits in one time is not
appropriate in another, and the difference of ages often modifies the character
of the acts. It is for the marriage itself a definite time when it is honorable
to think of children: in the vigor of the age, when there is hope of having
children, when their procreation is authorized by example, when conjugal union
is an object of desire. But once the maturity of advanced age has arrived,
better able to control children than to engender them, we are ashamed to bear
the marks of a legitimate union, to support a burden that is of another age,
and swollen bowels of an off-season fruit. The old men are indeed captives of
their very age, and a just shame of being untimely keeps them from going to the
works of marriage. Adolescents themselves often emphasize the desire to have
children and believe they excuse the warmth of their age by the lure of
engendering: how much more shame do old people have to do what the children do?
teens blush to confess! And even young people, whose fear of God calms and
moderates the heart, often renounce, as soon as they have a posterity, the
works of youth. Is it surprising in humans, when the animals themselves tell
us, by their mute conduct, that they have the concern to engender, not the
desire to mate? For once they feel their heavier bosom and the seed received in
the land of the bowels, they no longer engage in carnal commerce and no longer
cultivate the abandonment of love but the care of fatherhood. Humans have no
regard for children or for God; they defile those, they irritate him.
"Before," he says, "to form you in the womb, I knew you, and from
the womb I sanctified you" (Jer., I, 5). To contain your outbursts, you
see, so to speak, the hands of your Creator shaping man in the bowels. He
works, and this sacred mystery of the bowels, you profane, you, by your
passion? At least imitate animals, or respect God. And what do I say, animals?
The earth itself often rests upon the work of generation, and if the impatient
ardor of men overwhelms it with repeated sowing, it punishes the recklessness
of the farmer, and transforms his fertility into sterility. Thus the elements
themselves and the animals have a natural shame not to interrupt the work of
generation.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
therefore rightly that St. Elizabeth blushed with her grace, without
recognizing herself in fault. Although she had conceived of a man - it is not
permissible to think otherwise of a human birth - she blushed at the age when
she was a child and at the same time rejoiced to see her affront end: for is a
shame for women not to have the wedding reward, since this is their only reason
for getting married. She consoled herself by seeing her affront end at the
price of her shame: that shame of which I spoke, the shame she had because of
her age.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

this suggests that they no longer had conjugal relations between them; for if
she had not blushed at an old man's business, she would not have blushed to
give birth; and yet she blushes with her maternal burden, as long as she does
not know the religious mystery. She who was hiding because she had conceived a
son, came to congratulate herself on giving birth to a prophet. She blushed
before, she gives thanks; she doubted, here she is confirmed: "For,"
said she, "as soon as the sound of your salvation has sounded in my ears,
joy has made the child tremble in my bosom. So she uttered a loud cry when she felt
the arrival of the Lord, because she believed in the holiness of her
childbirth; there was no shame, as long as the birth of a prophet was proof
that his generation had been granted, not sought after.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

purposes of God (Is. 13). Yet the whole of the actions and teachings of our
Lord and Savior gives us to understand that a well-intentioned design has made
to choose preferably, to give birth to the Lord, the one who had married a man.
But why was not she made mother before her nuptials? Perhaps it could not be
said that she had conceived in adultery. And the Scripture, aptly, has
indicated these two things; she was a wife and a virgin; virgin, which shows
her free from any relation with a man; wife, to remove from the infamous stigma
of lost virginity the one whose pregnancy would have seemed to manifest decay.
And the Lord preferred to let some question his origin rather than the purity
of his Mother: he knew how delicate is the honor of a virgin, how fragile its
reputation for purity; and he did not think it expedient to establish the truth
of his origin at the expense of his Mother. Thus was the virginity of St. Mary
preserved, without detriment to her purity, without damaging her reputation;
for the saints must have a good reputation even with outsiders (I Tim. iii. 7),
and it would not be proper to leave to virgins whose conduct is an unfortunate
fame the cover and the excuse to see defamed until to the Mother of the Lord.
What could be blamed on the Jews, on Herod, if they had seemed to pursue the
child with adultery? And how did He Himself say, "I did not come to
destroy the Law, but to do it" (Matt. V, 17), if He had appeared to begin
with a breach of the Law, since childbirth outside marriage is condemned by the
law? Better yet, purity finds a witness of all safety: a husband, able and to
feel the insult and avenge the affront, if he had not recognized a mystery. Let
us add that this gives more credit to Mary's words, and spares her every reason
to lie; for she would have seemed to wish to cover her fault with a lie, if
without marriage she would have been pregnant; she would have had to lie, not
being a wife; wife, she had none, since the reward of marriage and the blessing
of marriage is, for women, fertility.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Another
reason, which is not negligible: the virginity of Mary was to deceive the
prince of the world, who, seeing her united to a husband, could not be wary of
her birth. That there was an intention to deceive the prince of the world, the very
words of the Lord proclaim him, when he commands the Apostles not to speak of
Christ (Matt. XVI, 20), forbids those whom he heals from to publish their
healing (Ib., VIII, 4), orders the demons not to speak of the Son of God (Lk,
IV, 35). That there was, as I said, an intention to deceive the prince of the
world, the Apostle in his turn proclaimed it: "We preach," he says,
"the wisdom of God hidden in mystery, that none of the princes of this
world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord
of majesty "(I Cor., II, 7 ff.): in other words, they would never have
made me redeemed by the death of Lord. He deceived him for us; He deceived him
to conquer him; He deceived the devil when he tempted him, when he prayed to
him, when he called him Son of God, never agreeing with his own divinity. Yet
he has deceived the prince of this world even more: for the devil, despite a
moment of uncertainty, when he said: "If you are the Son of God, throw
yourself down" (Matt. IV, 6), at least ended up recognizing it and
withdrew from it; the demons also knew him, since they said, "We know who
you are, Jesus, the Son of God; why did you come before time to torture us?
(Matt., VIII, 29); and they recognized his coming precisely because they knew in
advance that he would come. But the princes of this world did not know him;
what better proof can we claim than the text of the Apostle: "Had they
known it, would they never have crucified the Lord of majesty? In fact, the
malice of the demons is able to penetrate even the hidden things, but those
absorbed by the vanities of the world can not know the things of God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> There
was a happy division among the evangelists. St. Matthew shows us Joseph warned
by the angel not to send Mary away, the Evangelist Luke also testifies that
they had not united (Lk 1:27) and Mary herself recognizes it here, when she
said to the angel, "How shall it be, since I know no man? But in addition
St. Luke proclaimed her a virgin, saying, "And the virgin was called Mary,"
and the prophet had taught us by these words, "Behold, a virgin will
conceive." (Is. 14); Joseph also showed it, since, seeing the pregnancy of
the one he had not known, he was preparing to dismiss her; and the Lord
Himself, on the cross, made it manifest by saying to his Mother, "Woman,
behold your son," and to the disciple, "Behold your mother";
even the one and the other, the disciple and the mother, are witnesses of it,
since "from that hour the disciple took it home" (Jn, XIX, 26 ff.).
If there had been a union, she would never have left her husband, and this just
man would not have suffered her to go away. How, moreover, did the Lord
prescribe this divorce, having himself pronounced that no one should repudiate
his wife except in the case of fornication?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> As
for St. Matthew, he shows what a righteous man ought to do when he sees his
wife's fault, to keep himself from a homicide, pure of adultery; because
"who unites with a debaucher is only a body with her" (I Cor., VI,
16). Thus, in all circumstances, Joseph keeps the merit and is a fair figure,
which raises his testimony; for the mouth of the righteous ignores falsehood,
and his tongue speaks righteousness, his judgment utters the truth.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Do not be
moved if the Scripture often calls her a wife: she does not express the loss of
her virginity, but testifies to the nuptials and the wedding celebration; but
no one repudiates that which he has not taken for a wife; so to want to
repudiate her is to acknowledge that he had married her. Nor should one be
moved by the words of the evangelist: "He had no intercourse with her
until she gave birth to a son" (Matt. I, 25). Or else this is a scriptural
phrase that you meet elsewhere: "Until your old age, I am" (Is.,
XLVI, 4); after their old age did God cease to be? And in the psalm, "The
Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies the
footstool of your feet" (Psalm 109: 1); after that, will he not be seated?
Or again, it is by pleading a case that it is sufficient to say what is
connected with the cause, and we are not inquiring about the surplus; it is
sufficient to treat the cause of which we have been charged, by postponing the
incident. Having thus undertaken to show that the mystery of the Incarnation
was free from all carnal commerce, it has not been thought necessary to further
the attestation of Mary's virginity, so as not to appear to defend the Virgin
more than to affirm the mystery. Certainly, in telling us that Joseph was just,
it is sufficiently stated that he could not profane the Temple of the Holy
Spirit, the Mother of the Lord, the breast consecrated by the mystery.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">We have
learned the order of facts, we have learned the design; let's also learn the
mystery. It is good that she was a wife, but a virgin, since she represents the
Church, which is spotless, but wife: virgin she conceived of the Spirit, virgin
she gives us birth without pain. Perhaps St. Mary was also made fruitful by
someone other than her husband because the particular churches, fertilized by
the Spirit and grace, are visibly united to a mortal pontiff.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
when he came to him, the angel said to him," I greet you full of grace,
the Lord is with you; you are blessed among women. But she, at her sight, was
troubled by her entrance. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Recognize
the Virgin for her conduct, recognize the Virgin in her modesty, recognize the
Virgin in her words, recognize her in mystery. It is the fact of the virgins to
be disturbed and intimidated every time a man approaches them, to dread any
conversation with a man. Let the women learn to imitate this inclination for
modesty: only in her retreat, so that no man may see her, only the angel find
her; alone, without a companion, alone, without a witness, so as not to
diminish in vulgar interviews, she is greeted by the angel. Learn, virgin, to
avoid words that have been little remembered: Mary dreaded the very salvation
of the angel: "She, however, was wondering what was this salvation";
by modesty, for she was troubled; for prudence, for she was surprised at this
new formula of blessing, which was nowhere to be read, had never been
encountered until then. To Mary alone this salvation was reserved: only,
indeed, it is aptly called full of grace, having alone obtained that grace,
which no other had received, to be filled with the Author of grace.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So Mary
blushed, and Elizabeth blushed. Let us learn what distinguishes the modesty of
women from that of the virgin. This one blushed by having subject, this one by
modesty. For the woman one indicates a measure to his modesty; in the virgin
modesty flourishes her grace.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
the angel of the Lord said to him, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found
favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son,
and you will give him the name of Jesus. He will be tall. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">No doubt
the angel also said of John: "he will be great"; but he is as great
as a man, great as God; because "the Lord is great, worthy of all praise,
and his greatness has no limit" (Ps 144, 3). And it is very true that this
other was great, since "there is not, among the children of women, a
prophet greater than John the Baptist" (Lk, VII, 28). Yet he is greater
than he, for "the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him"
(Ib.). John is great, but before the Lord. And Jean, so great, drank neither wine
nor intoxicating drink; he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners (Mc, II,
16). To that one to wait for his merit of abstinence, having no power by
nature; but Christ, who by nature had the power to forgive sins, why would He
have avoided those whom He could make better than abstainers? There is also a
mystery: He does not refuse to be their guest, to give them his sacrament. One
therefore eats, the other fast: figure of the two peoples, one fasting in that
one, the other is nourished in it. Besides, Christ also fasted, so that you did
not swear the precept; He has eaten with sinners, to show you his grace, to
make you recognize his power.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So John is
also great, but his greatness has a principle, an end, while the Lord Jesus is
both end and principle, both first and last (Rev., XXII, 13). Nothing before
this first, nothing beyond this last. And that the laws of the human generation
do not lead you to the error of believing that he is not first, since he is a
Son. Attach to the scriptures: you can not wander. The Son is called first. It
is also read that the Father is alone: ​​"He alone possesses immortality
and dwells in the inaccessible light" (I Tim. VI, 16); so you have read,
"And to the only immortal God" (I Tim., 1,17). But He is not first
before the Father, and He is not alone without sons. If you deny one, you prove
the other: hold on to both, and you both confirm them. He did not say, "I
am anterior and I come next," but: "I am the first and I am the
last." The Son is prime, and therefore co-eternal: for He has a Father
with whom He is eternal. I dare say it: the Son is the first, but He is not
alone; and I say well and I say piously,</span><font face="Calibri"> </font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">but
He is not alone; and I say well and I say piously.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> Why
make an impious ear, heretics? The nets that you have stretched, you have
fallen. The Son is first, and He is not alone: ​​first, because always with the
Father, He is not alone, because He is never without the Father. It is not I
who says it, but He who said: "And I am not alone, because the Father is
with me" (Jn, xvi, 32). The Father is alone, because there is only one
God; the Father is alone, because there is one deity of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, and to be unique is to be alone. The Father is alone, only
the only Son, only also the Holy Spirit: for neither he who is Son is also
Father, nor he who is Father also Son, nor he who is Holy Spirit also Son.
Other is the Father, other the Son, other the Holy Spirit; for we read, "I
will pray to my Father, and he will give you another Paraclete" (John 14:16).
The Father is alone, for there is only one God, from whom all proceeds; the Son
is alone, for there is only one Lord, by whom all things exist (see I Cor.,
VIII, 6). To be alone is the fact of divinity; the generation testifies that
there is Father and Son, so that one never sees the Son to be without Father or
the Father without Son. So (the Father) is not alone, for He is not alone
immortal; He is not alone in inhabiting the inaccessible light, since "no
one has ever seen God, except the only Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father" (Jn, I, 18), who sits at the right hand of the Father . And it is
to say that he does not have access to the light that the Father inhabits! Is
the light better than the Father? So what light is inaccessible to Him for whom
the Father is not inaccessible? He is the true light and the author of the
eternal light, of which it is said: "He was the true light that enlightens
every man coming into this world" (Jn, I, 9). See if it would not be this
inaccessible light that the Father inhabited, that the Son also inhabited,
since the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So
He is truly great: for the power of God is widespread, the greatness of the
divine nature extends widely. The Trinity has no bounds, no boundaries, no
measure, no dimension; no place confines it, no thought embraces it, no
calculation evaluates it, no age modifies it. Doubtless the Lord Jesus has
given men greatness, for "their voice has spread throughout all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the earthly spaces" (Ps. 18: 5), but not
until the limits of the universe, not to the limits of heaven, not beyond the
heavens, while "in the Lord Jesus were created all things, in heaven and
on earth, visible and invisible; and He is first and foremost, and all things
abide by Him "(Col., I, 16 ff.). Contemplate the sky, Jesus is there;
consider the earth, Jesus is there; go up by the word to heaven, go down by the
word to hell, Jesus is there. For if you go up to heaven, Jesus is there; if
you descend to hell, He is there (Ps. 138, 8). Today, as I speak, He is with me
now, right now; and if now a Christian speaks in Armenia, Jesus is there;
because "no one says that Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit"
(I Cor., XII, 3). If by thought you plunge into the abyss, there too you will
see Jesus act; for it is written, "Do not say in your heart, who ascended
to heaven? ? no doubt to bring down Christ! ? or: who went down to the abyss? ?
obviously to remove Christ from the dead "(Rom., X, 6 ff.). Where, then, is
He not, since He has completed all things in heaven, in hell, and on earth? He
is therefore truly great, He whose power has filled the world, who is
everywhere and always will be, since "his reign will have no end".</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

seem here that Mary did not have faith, if we did not take careful care of it;
so it is not permissible for an unbeliever to appear to be the father of the
only begotten Son of God. And how could it be done - except, of course, the
privilege of a mother, who certainly deserved more consideration, but, finally,
because her privilege was greater, a greater faith had to be assured to her -
so how could Did Zacharie, for not having believed, be condemned to silence and
Mary, who would not have believed, honored by the penetration of the Holy
Spirit? But Mary could not refuse to believe,</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> nor
to rush lightly: to refuse to believe in the angel, to rush on divine things.
It was not easy to know "the mystery hidden for centuries in God"
(Ephesians III, 9, and Colossians 1, 26), which even the powers above could not
know. And yet she did not refuse her faith, nor did she hide from her role, but
she arranged her will, promised her services; for saying, "How will that
be? She did not question the effect, but asked how that effect. How much more
in this answer than in the words of the priest! She says, "How will that
be? He replied, "How will I know? She is already dealing with the affair,
he still doubts the news. He declares that he does not believe in declaring
that he does not know, and he seems, to believe, to seek yet another guarantor;
she declares herself ready for the realization and does not doubt that it will
take place, since she asks how it can happen; for you read: "How will it
be, since I know no man? This unbelievable and unprecedented childbirth, it was
necessary to hear it exposed before you believe it. That a virgin gives birth
is the mark of a divine, non-human mystery; "Take this sign for yourself,
it is said: behold, a virgin will conceive and bear a son" (Is., vii. 14).
Mary had read it, so she believed in accomplishment; but how would it be
accomplished, she had not read it, for that was not revealed to even such a great
prophet. The proclamation of such a mystery must have fallen from the lips of a
man, but of an angel; today for the first time we hear: "The Holy Spirit

and believe it. As well: "Behold," said she, "the servant of the
Lord; let it happen to me according to your word. " See the humility, see
the dedication. She calls herself the servant of the Lord, chosen to be his
Mother, and this unexpected promise did not exalt her. At the same time, as a
servant, she claimed no privilege as a result of such grace; she would
accomplish what would be ordained to her; for, to give birth to the Sweet and
the Humble, she had to show humility.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">As Mary
was quick to believe, even at abnormal conditions! For is there more
dissimilarity than the Holy Spirit and a body? more unprecedented than a virgin
who has become fruitful despite the Law, despite the customs, in spite of this
modesty which is the dearest concern of a virgin? In Zacharias, it is not a
dissimilarity of conditions, but the advanced age which prevented him from
believing; for the conditions were normal: of a man and a woman a child is a
regular thing, and nothing must seem incredible which is in conformity with
nature. As age depends on nature and not on the nature of age, it often happens
that age hinders nature; but it is not against reason that the inferior cause
yields to the superior cause, and that the privilege of nature is stronger than
the habits of a weakened age. Add to this that Abraham and Sarah had a son in
their old age, and that Joseph is "the son of old age" (Gen. XXXVII,
3). But if Sara is taken back for laughing, even more just is the condemnation
of the one who believed neither the message nor the precedent. Mary, on the
contrary, saying:</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

normal for anyone who wants to be believed to provide reasons to believe. So
the angel who announced the mysteries, to make him believe by a precedent, he
announced to Mary, a virgin, the maternity of an old and sterile woman, thus
showing that God can all that he please. As soon as she had learned of it,
Mary, not because of a lack of faith in the prophecy, not out of uncertainty of
this announcement, not out of doubt about the precedent provided, but in the
joy of her desire, to fulfill a pious duty, in the eagerness of joy, went to
the mountains. From now on filled with God, could she not rise hastily to the
heights? Slow calculations are foreign to the grace of the Holy Spirit. Learn
also, pious women, how eager you are to testify to your relatives near being
mothers. Marie, until then, lived alone in the strictest retreat; it has not
been retained either to appear in public by virginal modesty, nor of its design
by the escarpments of the mountains, nor of the service to be rendered by the
length of the road. Towards the heights the Virgin hastens, the Virgin who
thinks to serve and forgets her pain, whose charity is strength and not sex;
she leaves her house and goes. Learn, virgins, not to run the houses of others,
not to hang out in the squares, not to engage in conversations on public roads.
Marie lingers at home, rushes on the road. She remained at her cousin's for
three months; for, having come to render service, she had this service at
heart; she remained for three months, not for the pleasure of being in a
foreign home, but because he disliked her from showing herself often outside.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

have learned, virgins, the delicacy of Mary; learn his humility. She comes as a
relative to her relative, as a younger sister to her elder sister; and not only
does she come, but she is the first to salute; it is fitting that the more
chaste is a virgin, the more humble she is; that she knows how to honor her
elders, that she be mistress of humility, the one who makes profession of
chastity.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

immediately the blessings of the arrival of Mary and the presence of the Lord
manifest themselves: for "when Elizabeth heard the salvation of Mary, the

Notice the choice and precision of each word. Elizabeth first heard the voice,
but John was the first to feel grace: the latter, according to the order of
nature, heard, the latter shuddered under the effect of mystery; she perceived
the arrival of Mary, that of the Lord: the woman that of the woman, the child
that of the child. They speak grace; they realize it inside and approach the
mystery of mercy for the benefit of their mothers; and, by a double miracle,
the mothers prophesy under the inspiration of their children. The child
shuddered, the mother was filled; the mother was not fulfilled before her son,

(Ps. 126,3)? In other words, the Lord's inheritance is children, the price of this
fruit that comes from Mary's womb. He is the fruit of the breast, the flower of
the stem, of which Isaiah prophesied well: "A stem," said he,
"will rise from the stock of Jesse, and a flower spring from this
stalk" (Is., XI, 1): the stock is the race of the Jews, the stem Mary, the
flower of Mary the Christ, who, like the fruit of a good tree, according to our
progress in virtue, now flourishes, now fruiting in us, now reborn by the
resurrection that brings life to his body.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
how is it that the Mother of my Lord come to me? It is not ignorance that makes
her speak - she knows well that there is grace and operation of the Holy Spirit
that the mother of the prophet be saluted by the Mother of the Lord for the
benefit of her child - but she recognizes that it is the result not of a human
merit but of divine grace; so she says: "How is it given to me", that
is to say, what happiness comes to me, that the Mother of my Lord comes to me!
I admit to being there for nothing. How is it given to me? by what justice,
what actions, for what merits? These are not the customary steps between women
"that the Mother of my Lord come to me". I sense the miracle, I
recognize the mystery: the Mother of the Lord is fruitful of the Word, full of
God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"For,
behold, when your salvation was heard in my ears, the child trembled with joy

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">You see
that Mary did not doubt, but believed, and thereby obtained the fruit of faith.
"Blessed," said she, "who have believed? But you too blessed,
who have heard and believed! for every soul that believes, conceives and
engenders the word of God and recognizes his works. May all of you have the
soul of Mary to glorify the Lord; that in all lies the spirit of Mary to exult
in God. If there is corporeally only a Mother of Christ, by faith Christ is the
fruit of all: for every soul receives the Word of God, provided that without
spot, preserved from vices, it keeps chastity in purity without attack. Every
soul, therefore, who achieves this state magnifies the Lord, as the soul of
Mary magnified the Lord, and as his spirit shuddered in the Savior God. The
Lord is indeed magnified, as you have read elsewhere: "Magnify the Lord
with me" (Ps. 33, 4): not that the human word can add anything to the Lord,
but because it grows in us; because "Christ is the image of God" (II
Cor., IV, 4; Coloss., I, 15) and, therefore, the soul that does right and
religious work magnifies this image of God, at the whose likeness she was
created; hence, in magnifying her, she participates in her grandeur to a
certain extent and finds herself elevated in it: she seems to reproduce in her
this image by the brilliant colors of her good works, and as copy her by
virtue.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Now the
soul of Mary magnifies the Lord and his spirit trembles in God because,
dedicated soul and spirit to the Father and the Son, she venerates with a pious
love the one God, where all things come from, and the one Lord by whom are all
things (see I. Cor., VIII, 6).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Follows
the prophecy of Mary, whose fullness responds to the excellence of her person.
And it is not without interest, it seems, that Elizabeth prophesies before the
birth of John, Mary before that of the Lord. The salvation of men is already
being sketched and outlined; for sin having begun with women, good, too, begins
with women, so that women, in their turn, abandon effeminate manners, renounce
their weakness, and the soul, which has no sex. Mary, ignorant of error,
religiously applies herself to imitate her chastity.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Marie
stayed at home for three months and came back to her house. It is well that we
are shown Mary rendering service and faithful to a mystical number: for kinship
is not the only cause of this long stay, but also the profit of so great a
prophet. Indeed, if the first entry has procured such a result that the
salvation of Mary the child has shuddered in the breast, that the Holy Spirit
has filled the mother of the child, what increments can we believe that such a
space of time, the presence of St. Mary has earned him! "Marie stayed at
home for three months. Thus the prophet received the anointing and, like a good
athlete, was exercised from the maternal womb: for it was in preparation for a
great struggle that his strength was being prepared.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">At last
Mary remained until the time of birth was fulfilled for Elizabeth. Now, if you
take good care of it, you will find that it has never been noted except for the
birth of the righteous; for "the days were fulfilled for the birth of
Mary", "time was fulfilled" for the birth of Elizabeth, the time
of life was fulfilled when the saints left the career of this life. Plenitude
is for the life of the just, emptiness for the days of the wicked.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

of the saint is a joy for many, because it is a common good: because justice is
a social virtue. Also at the birth of this righteous one already sees the marks

and signified by the joy of the neighbors.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
fortunate to mention the time spent by the prophet in the maternal womb,
otherwise Mary's presence would not have been reported. But there is no
question of the time of his childhood, because, the presence of the Lord having
fortified him from the bosom of his mother, he did not know the shackles of
childhood. So, in the Gospel, we read nothing more about him than his birth and
his testimony: his thrill in his mother's womb, his word in the desert. It is
because he never knew the age of childhood, since raised above the nature,
above his age, he has, from the breast of his mother, begun with the measure of
the perfect age of the fullness of Christ (Ephes., IV, 13).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

his mother said, No, but his name is John. And they said to him, There is none
in your kinsmen to bear this name. So they asked his father by signs how he
wanted to be named. And, taking some tablets, he wrote these words: Jean is his
name. And all were astonished. And immediately his tongue was loosed, his lips
were opened, and he spoke to bless God. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Remarkably,
the holy evangelist thought it worth noting in the first place that many
thought of giving the child the name of his father Zacharie: thus you will
observe that his mother did not find the name of some foreigner displeasing,
but that the The Holy Spirit communicated to him that which the angel had
previously announced to Zechariah; He was unable to give the name of his son to
his wife, but Elizabeth learned by revelation what she had not learned from her
husband. "John," said he, "is his name; that is to say: it is
not we who give him a name, since he has already received from God his name. It
has its name: we recognize it, we did not choose it. The saints have the
privilege of receiving a name from God; so Jacob is called Israel because he
saw God; so our Lord was called Jesus before his birth; it is not the angel,
but his Father who has imposed on him this name: "My son Jesus, is it
written, will manifest itself with those who will share in his joy, who have
been reserved for the four hundred years. And behold, after these years my son
Christ will die and the age will be converted "(IV Ezra, VII, 28-30)"
You see, the angels announce what they have heard, not what they have taken on
them.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> Do
not be surprised if this woman testifies to a name she did not hear, since the
Holy Spirit, who had entrusted it to the angel, revealed it to her. Besides, it
was impossible for her to ignore the Precursor of the Lord, who had announced
Christ. And it should be added that no one in his kinship bore this name: you
thus understand that this name does not designate the family, but the prophet.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Zechariah
in turn is questioned by signs; but as his lack of faith deprived him of speech
and hearing, he could not express himself in a loud voice, he did so by hand
and by writing; for "he wrote these words: John is his name": by
which the name is not given but attested. And it is right that at once his
tongue was loosed: chained by unbelief, faith loosed it. So, too, let us
believe in order to speak (Ps. 115,1) so that our language, chained by the
bonds of unbelief, will be loosed into spiritual words. Let us write in spirit
the mysteries if we want to speak; Let us write the messenger of Christ "not
on tablets of stone, but on the tables of flesh of our heart" (II Cor.,
III, 3). For to speak of John is to prophesy Christ: let us speak of John, let
us also speak of Christ, so that our lips in turn can open, those lips which,
in a priest so great, were, as for an animal without reason, bridled by the bit
of a hesitant faith.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

good God is, quick to forgive sins: not only does He return what He has
withdrawn, but He still bestows what we did not expect. This man, who has been
silent for a long time, prophesies: for it is the height of God's grace that
those who had denied him pay homage to him. So let no one lose confidence; that
no one, at the thought of his past faults, despairs divine rewards.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is good
that in this prophecy concerning the Lord he speaks to his prophet to show that
there is here a blessing of the Lord: for lack of what, in this enumeration of
general goodness, it would have seemed, like a ungrateful, to silence those
whom he had received, whom he recognized in his son. But some may find it
unreasonable and extravagant to speak to an eight-day-old child. Yet, on
reflection, we fully understand that he could, once born, hear the voice of his
father, having heard the salvation of Mary before being born. Prophet
(Zechariah) knew that there are other ears for a prophet, those opened by the
Spirit of God, and not the growth of the body; he (John the Baptist) had the
sense to understand, having felt to flinch.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Notice
again how short is the prophecy of Elizabeth, how extensive is that of
Zechariah. Yet both spoke of the fullness of the Holy Spirit; but the good
order was respected, which requires the woman to be more applied to learning
divine things than to teach them. So we find it difficult to find a woman who
has prophesied more than the Mother of the Lord. Even the prophetess Mary,
sister of Aaron, as she quickly finished her song! (Ex., XV, 20 ff.) Instead of
the day when she spoke at length with her brother, she did not fail to be
punished for her words (Num., Xii, 1 ff.).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is therefore
rightly that our Lord Jesus, by his youth and solitude, warns us against the
attacks of pleasure, and that Our Lord to all suffers from being tempted by the
devil so that in Him we all learn to to triumph. Let us remark, then, that the
Evangelist, not without reason, shows us three principal institutions of the
Lord: for there are three things profitable and advantageous to the salvation
of man: the sacrament, the desert, the fast. "No one, indeed, is crowned
unless he has fought according to the rules" (II Tim., II, 5), and no one
is admitted to the fight of virtue unless he has first washed away from all the
faults that soiled it and consecrated by the gift of heavenly grace. The Lord
comes to baptism to make us realize the grace of this mystery by sight and by
meaning. And while the Law is promulgated with heaven and earth for witnesses
(Deut., XXX, 12 ff.), To convince you that the mystery of divinity, eternally
hidden in God (Col., I, 26), "Overpowers the Law, the heaven is no longer
called to witness but fulfills the office of witness, since the voice of God
descends from heaven. At the same time, so that the mystery of faith does not
run up against the doubt of your soul, the work of the invisible is visibly
proclaimed to you. The Lord comes to baptism: for He made all things for you (I
Cor., IX, 20). For the subjects of the Law - as if he were subject to the Law,
when he was not subject to the Law - He was circumcised, in order to gain the
subjects of the Law; to those who were without law He associated himself by
sharing their meal, in order to win those who lived without law. For the
disabled He was crippled by the suffering of his body in order to win them.
Finally He made himself all for all, poor for the poor (II Cor., VIII, 9), rich
for the rich, crying with those who cry (Rom., XII, 15), hungry with the
hungry, altered with the weathered, wide with those who are in abundance. He is
in prison with the poor man (Matt. Xxv. 36), with Mary weep (Jn. Xxi. 35), with
the Apostles II eats (Matt. XXVI, 20), with the Samaritan II. He is thirsty
(Jn. , IV, 7). In the desert He is hungry (Matt. IV, 12), so that the food
savored by the first man in his prevarication would be atoned for by the fast
of the Lord. It is to our detriment that Adam has satiated his hunger for the
science of good and evil; it is for our benefit that He has endured hunger.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Then
Jesus was led to the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
worth remembering how the first Adam was cast out of paradise into the desert,
to see how the second Adam came back from the desert to paradise. See also how
the damage is repaired according to their sequence, and how the divine benefits
are renewed by taking their own footsteps. A virgin land gave Adam, Christ was
born of the Virgin; this one was made in the image of God, This is the Image of
God; this one was placed above all animals without reason, this one above all
the living; by a woman madness, by a virgin wisdom; death by a tree, life by
the cross. One, stripped of the spiritual, has covered himself with the remains
of a tree; the other, stripped of the temporal, did not want a body garment.
Adam is in the desert, in the desert Christ: for he knew where to find the
condemned to dispel his distraction and bring him back to paradise; but as he
could not return to it covered with the spoils of this world, as one can not be
a resident of heaven without being deprived of all fault, he has left the old
man, clothed with the new (Col., III, 9 ff.): thus, as the divine decrees can
not be abrogated, there would be change of person rather than commutation of
sentence. But as soon as he had, for want of a guide, lost his way in paradise,
how in the desert could he have gone back to the lost road without a guide?
There are many temptations, the effort towards virtue difficult, easy sliding
towards error. Virtue has the same naturalness as woods: when they are still
low, ascent of the earth towards the sky, when their age blossoms into soft
foliage, this one, exposed to the venom of a cruel tooth, can be easily cut or
dried; but once established on deep roots and its branches pushed up, it is now
in vain that the bite of the beasts, the arms of the peasants or the various
blasts of storms attack the robust tree. What guide will he offer against so
many baits of the century, so many ruses of the devil, knowing that we have to
fight first "against the flesh and the blood, then against the powers,
against the princes of the world of this darkness, against the evil spirits
that fill the air "(Ephesians 6: 11-12)? Offer the angel? but he himself
has fallen; the legions of angels have barely saved individuals (II Kings, VI,
17). Send a seraph? but he came down to earth "in the midst of a people
whose lips were soiled" (Is., VI, 6 ff.), and there was only one prophet
whose lips he purified in contact with a coal. We had to look for another guide
that we would all follow. What would be this guide big enough to do good to
all, except the one who is above all? Who would establish me above the world,
except He who is greater than the world? What would be this guide large enough
to be able, in the same direction, to lead man and woman, Jew and Greek,
Barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man (Col. III, 11), if not He who is all
and in all, Christ ?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> For
the traps are many, wherever we go: traps of the body, traps of the Law, traps
set by the devil at the pinnacle of the temples, at the top of the walls, traps
of philosophy, trap desires - because the eye of the The courtesan is the trap
of the sinner (see Prov., VII, 21) - a trap of money, a trap in religion, a
trap in the cult of chastity. Because small surcharges weigh on the human soul
and often make it lean here or there according to the skill of the seducer. The
devil sees some religious man, serving God with reverence, full of respect for
the holy, incapable of doing any wrong: he makes him fall by his very religion,
causing him not to believe that the Son of God He has truly taken that flesh
which is ours, that body which is ours, that weakness of our members, while He
has undoubtedly suffered in His body, but His divinity has remained out of
reach; thus his very religion puts him at fault: for "whoever denies that
Jesus Christ came in the flesh is not of God" (I Jn, IV, 3). He sees a pure
man of uncontested chastity: he persuades him to condemn the marriage, which
will drive him out of the Church, the cult of chastity separating him from this
chaste body. Another has heard that there is "one God, whosoever cometh
all" (I Cor., VIII, 6): he adores and venerates him; the devil undertakes
it, closes his ears so that he does not hear that there is "one Lord, by
whom are all things" (Ib.): so by excessive piety compels him to be
impious, separating the Father from the Son and, at the same time, confounding
the Father and the Son, believing that there is unity of person and not of
power. Thus, for lack of knowing the measure of faith, does it inflict the
burden of error.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">How can we
avoid these pitfalls, so that we too can say: "Our soul, like a sparrow,
has been torn from the net of hunters; the net was broken, and we were
delivered "(Ps. 123, 7)? He does not say, "I broke the net"
-David did not dare to speak so - but "our help is in the name of the
Lord" (Ib 8), to show how the net would be undone, in order to prophesy
the coming into this life of the One who breaks the trap prepared by the
cunning of the devil. But the best way to break the trap was to present some
bait to the devil: thus, throwing himself on the prey, he would be caught in
his nets, and I could say: "They prepared traps for my feet, and they who
have fallen there "(Ps. 56: 7). What could be this bait, if not a body? It
was therefore necessary to use with the devil of this artifice, that the Lord
Jesus took a body, and a corruptible body, a crippled body, to be crucified by
this infirmity. For if it had been a spiritual body, He would not have said,
"The spirit is alert, but the flesh is crippled" (Matt. XXVI, 41).
Listen, then, to both voices, the one of the crippled flesh and the one of the
alert spirit:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Father,
if it is possible, let this chalice move away from me": it is the voice of
the flesh; "But not what I want, but what you want" (Matt. XXVI, 39):
that is the dedication and vigor of the spirit. Why disregard the Lord's
condescension? It was by condescending that he took my body, by condescending
that he took my miseries, took my infirmities; the nature of God certainly
could not feel them, since human nature itself has learned to despise them, or
endure them. So, then, let us follow Christ, according to what is written:
"You shall walk after the Lord your God and be attached to him"
(Deut., XIII, 4). To whom to attach myself, if not to Christ, as Paul said:
"Whoever cleaves to the Lord is but a spirit with Him" ​​(I Cor. VI,
17). Let's follow in his footsteps, and we can return from the desert to
paradise. See by what paths we are brought back: now Christ is in the desert;
He pushes, instructs, trains, exercises, and rubs the spiritual oil; as soon as
he sees it more robust, He takes him through the sown and fertile places, when
the Jews complained that his disciples, on the Sabbath day, were wringing ears
from the harvest (Matt. For from that moment He had installed His Apostles in
the cultivated field and in fruitful work; finally He establishes it in the
orchard at the time of the Passion; for you are reading: "So saying, Jesus
went through with his disciples the brook Kidron; there was a garden where He
entered, He and His disciples "(Jn, XVIII, 1). For the fertile field is
less than the garden, as the prophet teaches in the Song of Songs:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"It's
a walled garden that my sister and wife, an enclosed garden, a sealed fountain;
your breath is an orchard "(Cant., IV, 12 sqq.). Such is the pure and
unblemished virginity of the soul which can not be diverted from faith by any
fear of punishment, by any attraction of the pleasures of the world, by any
love of life. Finally, the reminder of man by the virtue of the Lord is
guaranteed by all the evangelist who alone shows us the Lord saying to the
thief: "Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise"
(Lc, XXIII, 43).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So Jesus,
filled with the Holy Spirit, is led to the desert on purpose to provoke the
devil - for if he had not fought, the Lord would not have triumphed for me -
mysteriously, to deliver this Adam from the exile; as proof and demonstration
that the devil is angry with those who strive to do better, and that especially
then we must take care that the weakness of the soul does not betray the grace
of the mystery.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Forty days:
you recognize a mysterious number. This is the number of days in which the
waters of the abyss have spread, he remembers to you; and it was when the
prophet had been sanctified by a fast of so many days that the favor of a
serene heaven was granted (I Kings, XIX, 8); it is by a fast of so many days
that Moses the saint has deserved to receive the Law; it is the number of years
when our fathers, living in the desert, obtained the bread of the angels and
the benefit of heavenly food, and it was not until the time accomplished by the
mysterious number that they deserved to enter the promised land; it is by as
many days as the Lord fasting that the entrance to the Gospel opens to us. If,
therefore, anyone wishes to acquire the glory of the gospel and the fruit of
the resurrection, he must not shirk this mysterious fast, which Moses in the
Law and Christ in his gospel show us, by the authority of the two Testaments,
to be the authentic test of virtue. But for what purpose did the evangelist
note that I was hungry, when for the fast of Moses and Elijah we find no such
indication? Is the patience of men more courageous than God? But he who could
not be hungry for forty days showed that he was hungry not for the food of the
body, but for salvation, at the same time harassing the adversary already
shaken, whom the fast of forty days had wounded. Thus the hunger of the Lord is
a pious trick: the devil, fearing in him a superiority, was already on his
guard: lured by the sight of his hunger, he was going to tempt him like a man,
and nothing would prevent the triumph. Learn at the same time this mystery: it
is the work of the Holy Spirit, the judgment of God, that Christ exposed
himself to the devil to be tempted.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And
the devil said to him, If you are children of God, tell this stone to become
bread. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We learn
that there are three main javelins of the devil, which he is accustomed to arm
to injure the human soul: one of gluttony, the other of vanity, the third of
ambition. He begins where he has already conquered; so I begin to conquer in
Christ by which I was conquered in Adam: if, however, Christ, image of the
Father, is my model of virtue. So let's learn to keep gluttony, to keep us
sensual, because it's a javelin of the devil. The trap tends when one prepares
the table for a royal feast, which often bends the constancy of the soul. For
it is not only when we hear the words of the devil, but also when we see his
riches, that we must beware of his trap. So you have recognized the javelin of
the devil: take the shield of faith (Ephesians 6: 16), the breastplate of
abstinence. But what does this entry into matter mean: "If you are sons of
God", except that he knew that the Son of God would come? But he did not
think he had come in the weakness of this body. On the one hand he probes, on
the other he tries; he testifies to believe in God, and he strives to deceive
man. But see the weapons of Christ, thanks to whom He triumphed for you, not
for Him. For He showed that His majesty could change the stones into bread when
He transformed another nature; but He teaches you that you must do nothing at
the mercy of the devil, not even to show your strength. Learn at the same time,
in this very temptation, the artificial skill of the devil: he tries to probe,
he probes so as to try. In his turn the Lord plays it so as to overcome it, and
still triumphs so as to play it: for if he had made this change of nature, the
Creator would have betrayed himself; He therefore made an evasive answer,
saying, "It is written that man does not live by bread alone, but by every
word of God." You see what kind of weapons He employs, to defend man
against the onslaught of the perverse mind, fortifying it and removing it from
the temptations of gluttony. He does not use God as his power? what would it have
served me for? ? but as a man He has recourse to the common resource: to be
occupied with the nourishment of the divine reading to the point of neglecting
the hunger of the body, of acquiring the nourishment of the heavenly word.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Thus
occupied, Moses did not desire bread; so busy, Elijah did not feel hungry for
prolonged fasting. For it is not possible for him who follows the Word to
desire the bread of the earth, when he receives the substance of the bread of
heaven? There is no doubt that the divine is preferable to the human, the
spiritual to the corporeal. whoever desires the true life hopes for that bread
which, by its invisible substance, strengthens the hearts of men (Ps 103, 15).
At the same time, when He says, "Man does not live by bread only," He
shows that it is the man who has been tempted, that is, what he has taken from
us, and not his divinity. Then comes the arrow of vanity: it is easy to sin,
because in wishing to display their virtue, men abandon the post, the place of
their merits. "And he brought him, it is said, to Jerusalem, and he set
him on the top of the temple. This, indeed, is vanity; when one believes one to
rise higher, the desire to make brilliant actions precipitates to the abyss.
"And he said to him, If you are children of God, throw yourself down. A
truly diabolical word, which strives to precipitate the human soul from the
place where its merits have been raised! for is there anything more suitable to
the devil than to advise to throw oneself down? Learn, too, to defeat the
devil. The Spirit leads you, follow the Spirit. Do not be tempted by the
attraction of the flesh; filled with the Spirit, learn to despise pleasures;
fast, if you want to win. It is normal for the devil to attempt to tempt you by
a man; Christ, being stronger, is tempted in front, you by a man. And that's
the word of the devil, when they say to you, "You are strong: eat and
drink, and stay the same. Do not trust yourself; do not blush for needing help
that Christ did not need, and yet He did not neglect, to instruct you with
these words:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Take
heed that your heart does not dwell on wine and excess" (Lk 21:34). Paul
did not blush, he who says, "I strive, not beating the air," because
the Apostle did not beat the air, but he struck the powers of the air,
"but he says, "I chastise my body and enslave it, lest after
preaching to others I find myself reprobate" (1 Corinthians 9: 26ff.). At
the same time the devil shows his weakness and wickedness, for the devil can
harm only the one who rushes himself. He who renounces heaven to choose the
land deliberately makes his life fall into a sort of precipice.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> At
that moment, the devil seeing his blunt line, he who had subjected all men to
his power, began to judge that there was more than one man there. But once
again the Lord did not believe that he had to fulfill, at the mercy of the
devil, the very thing that had been prophesied about him: He held to the
authority of the deity who is his own to ward off his devices; so whoever
alleged examples of the scriptures would be conquered by examples of the
scriptures. For God has the power to overcome, but Scripture triumphs for me.
Here again learn that Satan is transfigured into an angel of light (II Cor.,
XI, 14) and often uses the Divine Scriptures themselves to set traps for the
faithful. This is how he makes the heretics, as he tears the faith, as he
attacks the rights of piety. Do not be seduced by the heretic because he can
draw some arguments from the Scriptures; and that he does not boast of what he
seems learned. The devil also uses testimonies of the Scriptures, not to teach
but to circumvent and deceive. He recognized that this is applied to religion,
renowned for its virtues, powerful in miracles and works: it gives him the trap
of vanity to inflate this man of pride, so he does not confide in the piety,
but in his vanity, and instead of attributing to God (the good), he will do
himself honor. So the Apostles commanded the demons not in their name, but in
the name of Christ, so as not to appear to attribute anything to them. Thus
Peter heals the paralytic by saying, "In the name of Jesus of Nazareth
arise and walk" (Acts 3: 6). Learn also from Paul to flee vanity: "I
know, he says, a man? was he in his body or out of his body, I do not know, God
knows? who was delighted in heaven, and heard ineffable words which men can not
utter. From this I will boast, but of me I will not boast, except for my
infirmities "(II Cor., XII, 3-5). So, this time again, the devil, having
recognized a fort, puts into practice vanity, which even abuses the strong
ones; but the Lord answered him, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
By which you know that Christ is Lord and God, and that the Father and the Son
have one power, as it is written, "I and the Father are one" (Jn, X,
30 ). And therefore, if the devil alleges this "one," expose him that
it is written, "I and my Father are one," and detach "one,"
so as not to divide power; detach "one" without separating the Father
and the Son.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And
the devil still led him to a very high mountain, and he showed him all the
kingdoms of the universe in a moment. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is only
right that in the space of a moment the things of the age and of the earth be
shown; because it does not indicate so much the speed of the vision as the
fragility of a power obsolete: in a moment all this happens, and often the
honors of the world go away before having arrived. What can there be in the
century of long duration, when even the centuries are not of long duration?
This teaches us to despise the breath of a vain ambition, since all secular
dignity is subject to the power of the devil, frail to those who use it and
empty of fruit. 29. But how is this the devil who gives power, when you read
elsewhere that "all power comes from God" (Rom., XIII, 1)? Can we
serve two masters (Matt. VI, 24) or two receive power? Is there a
contradiction? by no means; but see that everything comes from God. For,
without God, no world, since "the world was made by him" (Jn, I, 10);
but, though done by God, his works are evil, for "the world is plunged
into evil" (I Jn, V, 19): the establishment of the world is from God, the
works of the world are evil. In the same way also from God comes the
institution of the powers, the bad the ambition of the power. "There is
not, it is said, power which does not come from God; those that exist have been
instituted of God ": not given, but instituted; and "whoever resists
power, it is said, resists the institution of God" (Rom. XIII, 1). Here
too, while saying that he gives power, the devil does not deny that all this
has been abandoned to him for a time only. So He who has abandoned him has
ordained it, and the power is not bad, but he who uses evil of power. As well
"do you want to not fear power? Do good, and you will receive praise
"(Rom., XIII, 3). It is not power that is bad, but ambition. Moreover, the
institution of power comes from God so much that he who uses power is God's
minister: "He is minister of God, it is said, for your good" (Rom.,
XIII, 4). So it's not the function that can be at fault, but the minister; it
is not the institution of God that can displease, but the conduct of the one
who administers. For, in order to pass from heaven to earth in fact, an emperor
gives the honors and receives the glory: if anyone misuses these honors, it is
not the emperor who is at fault, but the judge; the culprit is bound by his
crimes, and it is not the power but the service that is in question. So ? it is
good to use power, to seek honors? Well if we receive them, no if we take them.
Yet it is necessary to distinguish in this very good: for another is the good
use according to the world, other than perfectly virtuous usage; it is good
that the application to know divinity should not be hindered by any occupation;
for if there are many things, eternal life is unique; but "eternal life is
to know you, the only true God, and the One whom you have sent, Jesus
Christ" (Jn, XVII, 3). So it is eternal life that gives the most fruit,
and God alone gives eternal life as a reward. Let us then adore our only God
and Lord and serve Him only, so that He alone gives us as a reward the most
abundant fruit; let's flee everything that is subject to the power of the devil,
So it is eternal life that gives the most fruit, and God alone gives eternal
life as a reward. Let us then adore our only God and Lord and serve Him only,
so that He alone gives us as a reward the most abundant fruit; let us flee all
that is subject to the power of the devil, lest, by wicked tyrant, he should
exercise cruelly over those whom he will find in his kingdom, the power he has
received. The power does not come from the devil, but is exposed to the
pitfalls of the devil. It does not follow, however, that the institution of
powers is bad because powers are exposed to evil; for it is good to seek God,
but in this very search can slip deviation and error: if the one who seeks is
diverted to sacrilege by a tortuous interpretation, the stumbling block of this
researcher has worse results than he had not sought; yet the fault lies not
with research, but with the researcher, and it is not research that exposes to
evil, but the dispositions of the researcher. But if he who seeks God is often
tempted by the weakness of the flesh and the limits of intelligence, how much
more is he who seeks the age exposed! And the great danger of ambition is that
it is caressing to capture dignities; and often of those whom no vice has been
able to charm, no lust to move, no avarice to shake, ambition makes criminals.
It procures the favor of the outside, the danger within, and, to dominate the
others, begins by being a slave; she gives herself up in bowing to receive
honors, and, wishing to be at the pinnacle, takes her turn: for in the very
power, what matters is foreign; we make the law, we are our own slave.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It may be
said that only the one who did the evil is fearful. Yet he who sails on the sea
fears more, and on the other hand, when one is securely settled on the
mainland, one is not accustomed to fear sinking; but if one embarks on the
moving element, one is exposed to more frequent dangers. Flee the sea of ​​the
century: you will not fear the sinking. Even though the treetops are often
beaten by the breath of the wild winds, their roots are firm and they do not
fall; but when on the sea the winds are raging, if all are not shipwrecked, all
are at risk. Likewise, against the breath of evil spirits, no one is safe on
the sand (see Matt. VII, 27) or at sea, and "the ships of Tharsis are
often broken by the violence of the wind" (Ps. 47, 8).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This in
the moral sense. Moreover, from the mystical point of view, you can see that
the links of ancient misery have been unearthed step by step: it is first the
lakes of gluttony, then that of presumption, thirdly that of ambition that is
loosened. For Adam was tempted by the food and, entering with presumptuous
assurance in the place where the forbidden tree was, he incurred moreover the
reproach of reckless ambition by aiming at the divine likeness. So the Lord
first loosed the knots of the ancient iniquity, that once we had shaken off the
yoke of captivity, we would learn to triumph over sins with the help of
Scripture. But if the Lord Jesus did not desire what belonged to Him, why seek
the good of others? If the Creator of all things has despised the glory of the
world to courageously embrace poverty, why, in your house, this disgust of your
birth, this aspiration to what is not due to you? why beg for what you can not
long use, what will be your torture for a long time? Avoid pitfalls, avoid
fraud. And since, to bring down man, the devil moves the whole world by his
artificial trick, which he fights with all the attractions of the century, take
all the more care in his caresses. Eve had not been moved by a food, nor left
to herself by the oblivion of the commandments, but the attractive ambition of
the honor promised her had deceived her. If she had wanted to adore only the
Lord, she would not have sought what was not due to him. So you are given the
remedy by which you will blunt the line of ambition: serve the Lord alone;
there is no ambition in religious devotion.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And,
all the temptation finished, the devil departed from him until his hour. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
shown that almost all faults have their source in these three species of vices:
for the Scripture would not have said that all temptation was completed, if
these three points contained all the matter of sins, whose seeds must be
monitored from the beginning. Thus the end of temptations is the end of
covetousness, because the causes of temptations are the causes of desires. Now
the causes of covetousness are the pleasure of the flesh, the mirage of glory,
the greed of power. How pious it seems not to discard cohabitation with a
Christian woman! but here are frequent temptations; if the devil sees you
attentive to God, he makes you misleading suggestions; but you, so confident
that you are in your resolution, beware of temptation, knowing your nature.
These are the three things, if you remember, that Paul also prescribed to avoid
when he indicates the three kinds of sin that you need to be free to rely on
the crown of righteousness: "We do not have, he says, worn with flattering
words, or yielded to greed, God is witness of it; and we have not sought glory
from men "(I Thess., II, 5): so he overcame the devil, sought the crown
(II Tim., IV, 8). You see, then, that the devil has no persevering effort; he
usually yields to real courage, and, without ceasing to be jealous, he dreads
to insist, for he dislikes him to be too often conquered.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Having
therefore heard the name of God, he said, "It is said, even unto his
hour," for later he came, not to tempt, but to fight uncovered.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> Divine
Scripture teaches you, therefore, that you are not fighting against flesh and
blood, but against the snares of a spirit (Ephesians 6: 12). You see the
nobility of the Christian who fights against the masters of the world and,
while dwelling on earth, displays his strength of soul against the evil spirits
who are in heaven. It is not an earthly issue, for which we would fight on
earth; but since we are offered spiritual rewards, the kingdom of God, and the
inheritance of Christ, it is necessary first to overcome spiritual obstacles. A
crown is offered, you have to accept the fight. No one can be crowned unless he
has conquered; no one can conquer if he did not fight at first (see II Tim.,
II, 5). And then the crown is more fruitful when the penalty is greater:
"Narrow and narrow is the way that leads to life, wide and spacious that
leads to death" (Matt, VII, 13). So one must never fear the test: it is an
occasion of victory, a matter of triumphs. The rich man, who has not felt the
test in this world, is in suffering in hell; poor Lazarus, who was afflicted
and overwhelmed by poverty and suffering to the point that his ulcers were
licked by dogs, has by the sufferings of this miserable life earned the crown
of eternal glory (Lk. XVI, 19 ff.) ; for "many are the tribulations",
not of anyone, but "of the righteous" (Ps. 33, 20). As well as those
whom the Lord loves, He often chastises them (Heb, xii, 6, see Prov., III, 12).
Peter was tempted to deny, he denied to cry. And what about others? Job was
foolproof in the eyes of God, but though he was not a winner at all times; his
devotion was tested, but he did not have the reward due to courage: so he is
put in front of temptation, to be made more glorious. In this fight there is
also reason to consider gradation. The devil does not have but one arrow: he
multiplies the features, to triumph either by the offer, or by lassitude. It
hurts firstly in desires, secondly in affections, and thirdly in health; for it
attacks by the ulcers of the soul as of the body. Moreover, the variety of
events corresponds to the variety of wrestlers. The rich are harassed by the
wrong done to his greed, the father by the loss of his children, the man by the
pains, the body by the ulcers. What traits! That is why the Lord did not want
to have anything to lose, and if he came poor in this world, it was so that the
devil had nothing to take from him. Do you want to know how true it is? Listen
to the Lord himself: "This is coming," said he, "the prince of
this world, and he finds nothing in me" (Jn, XIV, 30). He did not want to
be the father of a small number, for the being of all - as for the ulcers of
the body, it would have been vain to test him there, he who despised all bodily
sufferings - and also for to show us that he had a right to a victory without
spot, which would triumph over the enemy of the body. But this one, like a man,
is tempted in his goods, this one in the sovereign domain; to one his heritage
is delighted, to the other the kingdom of the world is offered. And the devil
would not be complete without cunning: he fears to push the Son of God to the
end; he tempts that one with vexations, this one with offers. He, as a servant,
says, "The Lord has given, the Lord has taken back" (Job, I, 21); The
latter, conscious of his nature and his dignity, laughs at being offered what
is his. But, to return to the other episode, he arrives messenger on messenger;
they accumulate the wounds, and yet the courageous athlete has no troubled
soul. The woman is made to be the instrument of the first error (the one born
of a virgin had no woman who was accessible to error); friends are summoned to
crush their resistance under their bad advice. But "among all that happened
to him Job never sinned in words in the sight of God" (Job, II, 10). For
if he cursed the day by saying, "Perish the day that I was born" (Job
iii. 3), and, further down, "May he be cursed of him who cursed this day,
by whom a great monster must be crushed "(Job, III, 8), this belongs to
the prophecy, in that the devil, monster of this world of storms, was crushed
by Our Lord Jesus Christ; and if he desires to perish on the day of his birth
in the flesh, it is so that his day may count in regeneration: perish, says he,
the day of this world, so that the spiritual day may arise! Thus, in his
temptation, the holy man Job spoke of mysteries; for this conqueror of the
world saw Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

therefore, do not fear trials, but rather be proud of trials and say: "It
is in infirmity that we are powerful" (II Cor., XII, 10): it is then that
braids the crown of justice. But this one is the measure of Paul, while we,
since there are several crowns, must hope for some. In the world, the laurel is
crown, crown the shield. But you are promised a crown of delights, for "a
crown of delights will overshadow you" (Prov., IV, 9), and elsewhere:
"He will surround you with the shield of his benevolence" (Ps 5, 13,
cf. 90, 5); and the Lord "crowned with glory and honor" he whom he
loved (Ps 8, 6). So whoever wants to give the crown is tempted, and if you
happen to be tempted, know that the crown is preparing. Remove the struggles of
the martyrs, you remove their crowns; suppress their torments, you suppress
their beatitudes. Is not Joseph's temptation the consecration of his virtue? Is
not his unjust imprisonment the crowning of his chastity? How could he have
been associated with royalty in Egypt if he had not been sold by his brothers?
It was so by the will of God to test the righteous, as he shows when he says:
"How would it happen that today a large people had to eat" (Gen., L,

place is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: "The land of
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and the other inhabitants of the coast, those
of the seashore and beyond the Jordan, of the Galilee of Gentiles, people
sitting in the shadow of death, have seen a great light "(Is., IX, 1 sqq.)

took the book, to show that it was He who spoke in the prophets and cut short

Spirit of the Lord is upon me. You see the Trinity, co-eternal and perfect.
This same Jesus, the Scripture tells us that he is God and man, perfect on both
sides; she also speaks of the Father and the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit
is shown to be cooperating, when under the bodily appearance of a dove II
descends on Christ at the moment when the Son of God was baptized in the river,
where the Father spoke of heaven. What greater testimony to seek than this one,
when in his own voice He affirms to be the One who spoke in the prophets? He
receives the anointing of a spiritual oil and a heavenly force, to bathe the
poverty of human nature of the eternal treasure of the resurrection, to
separate the captivity of the soul, to illuminate the blindness of the Spirits,
to preach the year of the Lord, which extends over the endless times and can
not bring back the cycle of work, but grants to men the continuity of harvest
and rest. And He so bent over all the tasks that He did not even disdain the
office of reader, while we, ungodly, considered his body and refused to believe
in his divinity which must be deduced from his works miraculous.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is not
half that animosity betrays itself: forgetful of the love between compatriots,
it makes use to cruel hatreds motives to love. At the same time this trait,
like this word, proves that you wait in vain for the benefit of celestial mercy
if you want it to the fruits of the virtue of others; for God despises the
envious, and of those who persecute in others the divine benefits, He turns
away the wonders of his power. The acts of the Lord in his flesh are the
expression of his divinity, and what is invisible is shown to us by what is
visible (Rom., I, 20). It is therefore not without motive that the Lord
exculpates himself for not having performed miracles of his power in his
country, so that no one thinks that the love of the country must have for us
little He could not fail to love his fellow-citizens, loving all men; but it is
they who, by their hatred, have renounced this love of their country. Because
"love is not envious, do not swell" (I Cor., XIII, 4). And yet this
country has not been excluded from the divine benefits: what miracle greater
than the birth of Christ in her? See, then, what evils hatred brings: because
of his hatred, this country is judged unworthy that it operates in it as its
citizen, after having the dignity that the Son of God was born in her.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Truly,
I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elijah. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is not
that these days belonged to Elijah, but Elijah did his works there. Or again:
it was the day for those who, through his works, saw the light of spiritual
grace and turned to the Lord. This is why the sky opened when they saw the
eternal and divine mysteries; it was closed when there was famine for want of
the fertility of the knowledge of God. But of this we have written more fully
in our work on widows.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
there were many lepers in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was
healed except Naaman the Syrian. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
clear that this word of the Lord Savior forms and exhorts us to zeal to honor
God; it shows that no one is cured and delivered from the disease that stains
his flesh if he has not sought health with religious care: for it is not to
sleepers that the divine benefits are granted, but to the vigilant. And by a
well-chosen example and comparison, the arrogance of his envious compatriots is
confounded, and it is established that the Lord's conduct is in agreement with
the old scriptures.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">We read
indeed in the books of kings that a Gentile, Naaman, was, according to the word
of the Prophet, delivered from the stains of leprosy (II Kings, V, 14); Yet
many Jews were plagued by the leprosy of the body, and also by the soul: for
the four men who, being hungry, went first to the camp of the king of Syria,
were lepers, tells us the story (II Kings, VII, 3 ff.). Why, then, did the
Prophet not treat his brethren, treat his fellow-citizens, heal his own, heal
strangers, heal those who did not practice the law, and did not share not his
religion? Is it not that the remedy depends on the will, not the nation, and
that the divine blessing is conquered by desires, but is not granted by
birthright? Learn to crave what you want; the fruit of divine blessings does
not pursue indifferent people.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> But
even though this simple exposition can form the moral dispositions, the charm
of the mystery does not remain hidden. As the following follows from the
foregoing, so the foregoing is confirmed by the following. We have said in
another book that this widow to whom Elijah was sent prefigured the Church. It
is fitting that the people come after the Church. This people, gathered
together from among strangers, once a leper people, a people formerly defiled
before being baptized into the mysterious river, this same people, after the
mystery of baptism, washed away from the defilements of the body and the soul,
begins to be no more leprosy, but virgin without stain and without wrinkles
(Ephes., V, 25). It is therefore right to describe Naaman, grand in the eyes of
his master, and of admirable presence, since he is shown to us the figure of
salvation which will come for the Gentiles. The advice of a holy servant, who,
after the defeat of her country, had fallen captive to the power of the enemy,
warned her to wait for a prophet's salvation; he is healed not by the order of
a king of the earth, but by a liberality of divine mercy. Why is this mysterious
number of immersions prescribed to him? Why is the Jordan River chosen?
"Is he saying, Abana is not good, and Pharphar, these two rivers of
Damascus, rather than the Jordan? But it was in his mood that he preferred
them; on reflection, he chose the Jordan: for anger does not mean anything to
the mystery, faith knows it. Learn the benefit of baptism savior: leper when he
plunges, he emerges faithful.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Recognize
the figure of the spiritual mysteries: it is for the body that he asks for
healing, for the soul that he obtains it. Washing the body is the heart we
wash. For the leprosy of the body has not been, I see, purified more than that
of the soul, since after this baptism, purified from the defilement of its
former misguidance, it declares that it no longer wishes to offer to the
foreign gods the victims that he promises to the Lord. Learn also the laws of
virtue that is appropriate: he showed his faith, the one who refused the
presents. Learn at the double school of words and deeds what you need to imitate.
You have the precept of the Lord, the example of the prophet: to receive for
free, to give freely (Matt., X, 8), not to sell your ministry, but to offer it;
the grace of God must not be evaluated and taxed, and in the mysteries the
priest must seek not to be rich but to serve. Yet it is not enough not to seek
profit for yourself: you must still hold the hands of your servants. You are
not only asked to keep yourself alone and undefiled; for the Apostle did not
say, "Keep yourselves alone," but "you keep yourselves
clean" (I Tim., V, 22). It is therefore necessary not only your integrity
in the place of such traffics, but also that of your house; for "the
bishop must be without reproach, governing his house well, holding his children
in subjection and in all chastity. But if anyone can not govern his house, how
will he care for the Church "(I Tim. III, 2-5)?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So
instruct your servants; exhort it, watch it, and if a servant deceives you? I
do not exclude what is possible to man? if he is surprised, dismiss him, following
the example of the prophet. The shameful wages are soon followed by leprosy,
and ill-gotten money defiles the body and the soul. "You have received
money, it is said, and you will have a field, a vineyard and olivaies and
herds; and the leprosy of Naaman will be attached to you and to your seed
forever. See how the father's act has condemned the succession of his heirs;
for it is an inexpiable fault to sell the mysteries, and heavenly grace makes
its vengeance upon the descendants. Also "the Moabites" and others
"will not enter until the third and fourth generation" (Deut., XXIII,
3), that is to say, to interpret simply, until the fault ancestors have been
erased by successive generations. But as those who have sinned against God by
the misguidance of idolatry are chastised, we see it, until the fourth
generation, the hard sentence certainly seems the sentence of which the
authority of the prophet forever strikes the seed of Giézi to because of his
lust, especially since Our Lord Jesus Christ gave to all, through baptismal
regeneration, the forgiveness of sins; unless one thinks of the inheritance of
vices rather than that of race, just as those who are children of the promise
are counted as a good race, so also those who are the sons of error are judged
bad race. For the Jews have the devil as their father (Jn, VIII, 44), from whom
they descend not in the flesh but through their crimes. Thus all the covetous,
all the miseries possess the leprosy of Genzi with their riches, and by the
ill-gotten good they have amassed less a patrimony of riches than a treasure of
crimes for an eternal torment and a brief enjoyment. For while wealth is
perishable, punishment is endless, since neither the miser nor the drinker nor
the servant of idols will possess the Kingdom of God (I Cor. VI, 9).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
all those in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things;
and they got up and chased him out of the city. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
sacrileges of the Jews, which the Lord had predicted well in advance, and in a
verse of Psalm II had indicated what he should suffer when He was in his body:
"They were returning to me," said II. evil for good "(Ps 34:12)
- in Gospel II shows fulfillment. Then, indeed, that it spread its benefits
among the populations, them inflicted to them insults. It is not surprising
that they lost salvation by driving the Savior out of their territory. The Lord
settles on them: He has by his example taught his Apostles how to be all things
to all; He does not exclude good will nor compels recalcitrants; He does not
resist when he is hunted, nor does he fail to whom he is summoned. It is thus
that, elsewhere, the Gerasenians can not bear his miracles, he abandons them as
cripples and ungrateful (Lc, VIII, 37). At the same time understand that his
Passion in his body was not constrained, but voluntary; that he was not seized
by the Jews, but offered himself. When He wills, He is arrested; when He wills
it, He falls; when He wills it, He is crucified; when He wills, no one
restrains him. Here he had climbed to the summit of the mountain to be
precipitated; and behold, He comes down in their midst, having suddenly changed
or stunned the minds of those furious; for the hour had not yet come from his
Passion. And even He preferred to heal the Jews more than to lose them, so that
the ineffective result of their fury would make them renounce what they could
not accomplish. You see it then, here it is by his divinity that he acted, and
there it was voluntarily that he was arrested: how, indeed, would have been
seized by some, Him that a crowd could not seize? But he did not wish sacrilege
to be done by the great number, to place upon the authors of the crime the
odiousness of crucifixion: He would be crucified by some, but He would die for
the whole world.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

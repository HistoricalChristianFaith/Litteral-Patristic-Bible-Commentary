<i>And He said unto His disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a
steward, and they accused him of scattering his goods. And he called him, and
said unto him, What is this that I hear of you? Give up the account of your
stewardship: for you can be no longer steward. And the steward said within
himself What shall I do, for my lord takes away from me the stewardship? I
cannot dig: and to beg I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that when I am
removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. So he
called each one of his lord's debtors, and said unto the first; How much do you
owe unto my lord? And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said unto him,
Take your writing, and sit down, and write fifty quickly. And afterwards he
spoke to the second, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred cors </i></span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_10_sermons_99_109.htm#2" rel="nofollow"><i><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>2</u></span></sup></i></a><i><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> of wheat. And he said unto him, Take your writing, and
write eighty. And the lord praised the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the children of this world are wise in their generation more than
the children of light. And I say unto you, Make for yourselves friends of the
unrighteous mammon: that when it has failed, they may receive you into eternal
tabernacles. </span></i></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">OUR
Lord Jesus Christ, revealing His glory to the Jewish multitudes, or rather to
all those who have believed on Him, said; "I am the light of the
world:" and again, "I am come a light into this world." For He
fills the mind of those who fear Him with a divine and intellectual light, that
they may <a name="p507"><font color="#000000">|507</font></a> not wander from the right way by walking in
gloom and darkness; but may rather know how to advance uprightly in every good
work, and in whatsoever aids a man in leading a saintly life. He would have us
therefore to be good, and ready to communicate, loving one another, and
merciful, and adorned with the honours of charity. Most wisely therefore did He
prepare for us the present parable: which we being anxious to explain to the
best of our ability, of necessity speak as follows to those who love
instruction.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
parables then indirectly and figuratively explain to us much that is for our
edification, provided only we consider their meaning in a brief and summary
manner. For we are not to search into all the parts of the parable in a subtle
and prying way, lest the argument by its immoderate length weary with
superfluous matter even those most fond of hearing, and tire men with a crowd
of words. For if, for instance, any one were to undertake to explain, who is to
be regarded by us as the man who had a steward, who was accused unto him; or
who possibly it is that accused him; and who too those are who owed the debts,
and subtracted a portion from them; and for what reason one is said to have
owed oil, and the other wheat; he will render his discourse at once obscure and
redundant. All the parts of the parable therefore are not necessarily and in
every respect useful for the explanation of the things signified, but, so to
speak, have been taken to form an image of some important matter, which
figuratively sets forth some lesson for the profit of the hearers.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
sense therefore of the present parable is something like the following:
"The God of all wills that all men should be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth." For this reason "He also gave the law for a
help," according to the expression of the prophet. And the law in such
passages we say means, not of course that which was ministered by Moses, but
rather the whole inspired Scripture, by means of which we learn the path which
leads straight unto every good and saving thing. The Lord of all therefore
requires us to be thoroughly constant in our exertions after virtue, and to fix
our desires upon the better and holy life, setting ourselves free <a name="p508"><font color="#000000">|508</font></a>
from the distractions of the world, and from all love of riches, and of the
pleasure which wealth brings, that we may serve Him continually, and with
undivided affections. For He also says by the harp of the Psalmist; "Be
constant, and know that I am God." And further, by His own mouth, the
Saviour of all says to those who possess worldly riches, "Sell your
possessions, and give alms: make for you purses that grow not old: a treasure
for ever, unfailing in heaven." Now the commandment is indeed for our salvation,
but the mind of man is very weak, fixed constantly, so to speak, upon things
which are of earth chiefly, and unwilling to withdraw itself from the delight
of riches. It loves vain boasting; is soothed much by the praises of
flatterers; longs for beautiful equipments, and counts nothing better than
temporal honour. And knowing this, the Saviour has Himself somewhere said of
them, "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
God!" And further, "that it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle, than a rich man into the kingdom of God." For as long as
a man lives in wealth and pleasure, he is careless about piety to God. For
wealth renders men contemptuous, and sows in the minds of those that possess it
the seeds of all voluptuousness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Is
there then no way of salvation for the rich, and no means of making them
partakers of the hope of the saints? Have they fallen completely from God's
grace? Is hell and the fire necessarily prepared for them, such as is the
fitting lot of the devil and his angels? Not so: for lo! the Saviour has shown
them a means of salvation in the present parable. They have been entrusted with
worldly wealth by the merciful permission of Almighty God: according
nevertheless to His intention <a name="p509"><font color="#000000">|509</font></a> they have been appointed
stewards for the poor. But they discharge not their stewardship rightly, in
that they scatter, so to speak, what has been given them of the Lord: for they
waste it solely on their pleasures, and purchase temporal honours, not
remembering God, Who says, "You shall open wide your mercy unto your
brother, even to him that has need of you." Nor moreover Christ Himself,
the Saviour of us all, Who says, "Be you merciful, even as your Father Who
is in heaven is merciful.'' But they, as I said, make no account whatsoever of
showing mercy to their brethren, but study only their own pride. And this it is
which accuses them before the Lord of all. And of course upon the approach of
death they must cease from their stewardship, withdrawing them as it does from
human affairs. For the net of death no man can escape from. What therefore
would Christ have them to do? It is, that while they are yet in this world, if
they are unwilling to divide all their wealth among the poor, that at least
they should gain friends by a part of it; and numerous witnesses to their
charitableness, even those who have received well at their hands: that when
their earthly wealth fails them, they may gain a place in their tabernacles.
For it is impossible for love to the poor ever to remain unrewarded. Whether
therefore a man give away all his wealth, or but a part, he will certainly
benefit his soul.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is an act therefore that becomes the saints, and is worthy of perfect praises,
and that wins the crowns above, to set no store by earthly wealth, but
distributing it among those that are in need, to gather rather that which is in
heaven, and obtain purses that grow not old, and possess a treasure that fails
not: and next in order comes the employment of a sort of artifice, so as to
obtain those for friends who are especially near unto God, by giving them some
portion of their wealth, and comforting the many who are afflicted with
poverty, that so they may share what is theirs. And something of this sort the
very wise Paul also advises, saying unto those who love wealth: "Let your
abundance be for their want, that their abundance also may be for your
want."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

most distinguished and experienced teachers, when they wish to fix any
important doctrine deep in the minds of their disciples, omit no kind of
reasoning able to throw light upon the chief object of their thoughts; at one
time weaving arguments together, at another employing apposite examples, and so
gathering from every quarter whatever is serviceable for their use. And this we
find Christ also, Who is the Giver unto us of all wisdom, doing in many places.
For oftentimes He repeats the very same arguments upon the subject, whatever it
may be, that the mind of those who hear may be led on to an exact understanding
of His words. For look again, I pray, at the purport of the lessons set before
us: for so you will find our words to be true. "He that is faithful in
little," He says, "is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in
little, is unjust also in much."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Before,
however, I proceed further, I think it would be useful to consider, what was the
occasion of a discourse such as this, and from what root it sprung: for so the
sense of what is <a name="p512"><font color="#000000">|512</font></a> said will become very evident. Christ
then was teaching the rich to feel especial delight in showing kindness to the
poor, and in opening their hand to whoever are in need, so laying up treasures
in heaven, and taking forethought for the riches that are in store. For He
said, "Make for yourselves friends of the unrighteous mammon: that when it
has failed, they may receive you into eternal tabernacles." But as being
God by nature, He well knew the slothfulness of the human mind in every earnest
and good work. It escaped not His knowledge, that men, in their greediness
after wealth, giving up their mind to the love of lucre, and being tyrannized
over by this passion, become hard-hearted and unsympathizing with affliction,
and show no kindness whatsoever to the poor, even though they have heaped up
much wealth in their stores. That those therefore who are thus minded, have no
share in God's spiritual gifts, He shows by most evident examples, and says,
"He that is faithful in little, is faithful also in much: and he that is
unjust in little, is unjust also in much." O Lord, explain unto us the
meaning: open You the eye of our heart. Listen therefore while He explains
clearly and exactly what He said. "If therefore you have not been faithful
in the unrighteous mammon, who will give you the true? The little therefore is
the unrighteous mammon: that is, worldly wealth, gathered often by extortion
and covetousness. But those who know how to live virtuously, and thirst after
the hope that is in store, and withdraw their mind from earthly things, and
think rather of those things that are above, utterly disregard earthly wealth;
for it offers nothing but pleasures, and voluptuousness, and base carnal lusts,
and splendour that profits not, but is transitory and vain. And so one of the
holy apostles teaches us, saying, "That all that is in the world is the
lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world."
But such things as these are absolutely nothing to those who lead a sober and
virtuous life: for they are trifling, and temporary, and full of impurity, and
provocative of the fire and judgment, and scarcely reaching to the end of the
life of the body, even if they do not, when any danger suddenly befalls those
that possess them, unexpectedly depart away. Christ's disciple therefore
rebukes the rich, saying, "Come now, you rich men, weep, and lament over
the miseries <a name="p513"><font color="#000000">|513</font></a> that are coming upon you. Your wealth is
decayed, your garments are motheaten. Your gold and your silver are rusted, and
the rust of them shall be your testimony." How then are the gold and
silver rusted? By being stored up in excessive abundance; and this very thing
is the witness against them before the divine judgment seat, of their being
unmerciful. For having gathered into their treasuries a great and unnecessary
abundance, they made no account of those who were in need, although it was in
their power, had they so wished, to do good easily to many; but they were not
"faithful in the little."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
in what way men may become faithful, the Saviour Himself next taught us: and I
will explain how. A certain Pharisee besought Him to eat bread with him on the
sabbath day, and Christ consented: and having gone there, He sat down to meat:
and there were many others also feasting with them. And none of them by any
means resembled men who possessed nothing, but, on the contrary, they were all
persons of distinction, and great haughtiness, and lovers of the foremost
seats, and thirsting after vainglory, being clothed as it were in the pride of
wealth. What then said Christ to His inviter? "When you make a dinner or a
supper, call not your friends, nor your brethren, neither your kinsmen, nor
your rich neighbours, lest they also invite you again, and a re-compense be
made you. But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and
the blind. And you shall be blessed, because they cannot recompense you; for
you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." This then I
think is a man's being faithful in little, that he have pity upon those who are
in need, and distribute assistance from his means to such as are in extreme
distress. But we, despising a way thus glorious and sure of reward, choose one
dishonourable and without reward, by treating with contempt those who are in
utter poverty, and refusing even sometimes to admit their words into our ears;
while, on the other hand, we luxuriously provide a costly table, either for friends
who live in pomp, or for those whose habit it is to praise and flatter, making
our bounty an occasion for indulging our love of praise. But this was not God's
purpose in permitting us to possess wealth. If therefore we are unfaithful in
the little, by <a name="p514"><font color="#000000">|514</font></a> not conforming ourselves to the will of
God, and bestow the best portion of ourselves upon our pleasures and our
boasts, how can we receive from Him that which is true? And what is this? The
abundant bestowal of those divine gifts which adorn man's soul, and form in it
a godlike beauty. This is the spiritual wealth, not that fattens the flesh,
which is held by death, but rather that saves the soul, and makes it worthy of
emulation, and honourable before God, and that wins for it true praises.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
is our duty therefore to be faithful unto God, pure in heart, merciful and
kind, just and holy: for these things imprint in us the outlines of the divine
likeness, and perfect us as heirs of eternal life. And this then is that which
is true.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that this is the purport and view of the Saviour's words, any one may readily
learn from what follows. For He said, "If you have not been faithful in
that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?" And
again, we say that which is another's is the wealth we possess. For we were not
born with riches, but, on the contrary, naked; and can truly affirm in the
words of Scripture, "that we neither brought anything into the world, nor
can carry anything out. For the patient Job also has said something of this kind:
"Naked was I born from my mother's womb; naked also shall I go
onwards." It is therefore no man's own by right of nature that he is rich,
and lives in abundant wealth: but it is a thing added on from without, and is a
chance matter; and if it cease and perish, it in no respect whatsoever harms
the definitions of human nature. For it is not by virtue of our being rich that
wc are reasonable beings, and skilful in every good work: but it is the
property of our nature to be capable of these things. That therefore, as I
said, is another's which is not contained in the definitions of our nature,
but, on the contrary, is manifestly added to us from without. But it is our
own, and the property of human nature to be fitted for every good work: for as
the blessed Paul writes, "We have been created unto good works, which God
has before prepared, that we should walk in them."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
therefore any are unfaithful in that which is another's, in those things
namely, which are added unto them from without, how shall they receive that
which is their own? How, that is, shall they be made partakers of the good
things which God <a name="p515"><font color="#000000">|515</font></a> gives, which adorn the soul of man, and
imprint upon it a divine beauty, spiritually formed in it by righteousness and
holiness, and those upright deeds which are done in the fear of God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
such of us then as possess earthly wealth open our hearts to those who are in
need; let us show ourselves faithful and obedient to the laws of God, and
followers of our Lord's will in those things which are from without, and not
our own, that we may receive that which is our own, even that holy and
admirable beauty which God forms in the souls of men, fashioning them like unto
Himself, according to what we originally were.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that it is a thing impossible for one and the same person to divide himself
between contraries, and still be able to live blamelessly, He shows by saying,
"No man can serve two lords: for either he will hate the one, and love the
other, or he will honour the one, and despise the other." And this indeed
is a plain and evident example, and very suitable for the elucidation of the
subject before us. For that which follows is, so to speak, the conclusion of
the whole argument: "for you cannot serve God and mammon." For if, He
says, a man be a slave of two masters, of diverse and contrary wills, and whose
minds are irreconcilable with one another, how can he please them both? For
being divided in endeavouring to do that which each one approves, he is in
opposition to the will of both: and so the same person must inevitably appear
bad and good. If therefore, He says, he determine to be true to the one, he
will hate the other, and set him of course at nought. It is not therefore
possible to serve God and mammon. For the unrighteous mammon, by which wealth
is signified, is a thing given up to voluptuousness, and liable to every
reproach, engendering boasting, and the love of pleasure, making men
stiff-necked, the friends of the wicked, and contemptuous: yes, what base vice
does it not produce in them that possess it?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
the goodwill of God renders men gentle, and quiet, and lowly in their thoughts;
long-suffering, and merciful, and of exemplary patience, not loving lucre, nor
desirous of wealth, content with food only and raiment, and especially fleeing
from "the love of money, which is the root of all evils:" joyfully <a name="p516"><font color="#000000">|516</font></a> undertaking toils for piety's sake; fleeing from the love of
pleasure, and earnestly shunning all feeling of wearisomeness in good works,
while constantly they value, as that which wins them reward, the endeavour to
live uprightly, and the practice of all soberness. This is that which is our
own, and the true. This God will bestow on those who love poverty, and know how
to distribute to those who are in need that which is another's, and comes from
without, even their wealth, which also has the name of mammon.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">THE
love of money, my brethren, is a most wicked passion, and not easy to abandon.
For when Satan has planted this malady in a man's soul, he next proceeds to
blind him, nor does he permit him to listen to the words of exhortation, lest
there be found for us a way of healing, able to save from misery those who are
ensnared thereby. And observe again, I pray, how true my words upon this
subject are from the instance even of the Pharisees. For they were lovers of
riches, and enamoured of gain, and regarded a bare sufficiency with contempt.
For even, so to speak, throughout the whole of the divinely inspired Scripture,
one may see them blamed on this very account. For it is said by the voice of Isaiah
to the mother of the Jews, I mean, Jerusalem, "Your princes are
rebellious, the partners of thieves: loving bribes, pursuing after reward: they
judge not the fatherless, neither do they regard the widow's suit." And
the prophet Habbakuk also said, "How long, O Lord, shall I cry unto you,
and You wilt not hear? and shout unto You, being oppressed, and You will not
deliver? Judgment is before me, and the judge has taken a bribe: therefore is
the law of none avail, and judgment comes not forth unto completion: for the
wicked prevails over the righteous, therefore does judgment come forth
perverted." For as being lovers, as I said, of lucre, they repeatedly gave
judgment on the matters before them, <a name="p518"><font color="#000000">|518</font></a> not according to
what was agreeable to the laws of God, but, on the contrary, iniquitously, and
in opposition to God's will.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Moreover,
the Saviour Himself rebuked them, thus saying, "Woe unto you, Scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites: who tithe anise, and mint, and cummin; and have omitted
the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith." For as the
law had set apart for them the right of receiving tithes of every one, they
extended the exactness of the search after them down to the most insignificant
vegetables, while they made but slight account of the weightier matters of the
law, that is, of those commandments which were of necessary obligation and for
men's good.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"Because
therefore the Pharisees, it says, were lovers of money, they derided
Jesus," for directing them by His salutary doctrines to a praiseworthy
course of conduct, and rendering them desirous of saintly glories. For it was
their duty, He tells them, to sell their possessions, and make distribution to
the poor; so would they possess in heaven a treasure that could not be
plundered, and purses that could not be harmed, and wealth that would not have
to be abandoned. And why then did they deride Him? For certainly the doctrine
was salutary, a pathway of hope in things to come, and a door leading unto the
life incorruptible: for they were being taught by Him the manners of true
prosperity, and learning how they must seize the crown of the heavenly calling;
how too they might become partakers with the saints, and children of the city
that is above, the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and which is truly free, and
the mother of the free. For as the blessed Paul writes, "Jerusalem, which
is our mother and is above, is free." And why then did they mock Him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us see the cause of their wickedness. The passion of avarice had possession of
their heart, and their mind being tyrannized over by it was in subjection even
against its will; humbled under the power of wickedness, and bound as it were
by inevitable bonds. For so the writer of Proverbs somewhere says, "that
every man is bound by the cords of his sins." For as the more virulent
diseases of the body do not admit of the remedies of medicine, and flee away as
it were from healing; and if any one apply that which is naturally adapted to
do good, are irritated the more, and grow angry, however <a name="p519"><font color="#000000">|519</font></a>
gently treated by the art: so also those passions to which the souls of men are
liable, are sometimes obdurate, and refuse to listen to admonition, and will
not hear a single word that summons them to depart from evil, and directs them
into a better course. And as horses that are hard-mouthed and unmanageable, and
excessively spirited will not obey the reins; so also the mind of man when
under the influence of passion, and thoroughly inclined to turn aside unto
evil, is disobedient and intractable, and rejects with hatred the being healed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
therefore the Saviour of all had expended upon them many words, but saw that
they would not change from their crafty purposes and passions, but preferred
rather to abide in their innate folly, He betakes Himself at length to sterner
reproofs, the very occasion calling them thereto. He shows therefore that they
are hypocrites, and liers in wait among the altars, and eager after the glory
due to righteous and good men, without being such in reality: not being in
earnest in meriting the approval of God, but hunting on the contrary eagerly
after the honours which come from men. He said therefore, "You are they
which justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which
is high among men, is an abomination before God." This He is found also in
another place saying unto them; "How can you believe, who receive honour
one of another, and seek not the honour that comes from the one God." For
the God of all crowns with praises unto righteousness those who are truly good:
but those who love not virtue, but are hypocrites, steal perchance by their own
votes solely the reputation of being honourable. But no one, O worthy sirs,
some perchance may say, crowns himself; and the man is justly ridiculed, who
devises praises for himself: for it is written, "Let your neighbour praise
you, and not your own mouth: a stranger, and not your own lips." But
though hypocrites may be able possibly to remain undetected, and seize the
honours which men bestow, "yet God, He says, <a name="p520"><font color="#000000">|520</font></a> knows
your hearts." The Judge cannot be deceived; He sees the depth of our mind;
He knows who is the true combatant, and who steals by fraud the honour which
another truly deserves: and while He honours him who is truly just, He
"scatters the bones of the men-pleasers," according to the Psalmist's
expression. For the desire of pleasing men is constantly, so to speak, the
nurse, and head, and root of that accursed pride which is hated alike by God
and men. For he who is the victim of this passion lusts after honour and
praise: and this is hateful unto God: for He hates the proud, but accepts and
shows mercy to him who loves not glory, and is lowly in mind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
when Christ had crushed them with these reproofs He added thereto yet something
more; even that which they were about to suffer by reason of their disobedience
and wickedness; "For the law, He says, and the prophets were until John:
thenceforth the kingdom of God is preached, and every one takes it by force.
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one point of the
law to fall." Again does He conceal in obscurity that which would give
them pain, and veils, so to speak, the prediction of those things that were
about to happen to all who would not obey Him. For Moses, He says, and with him
the company of the holy prophets, before announced the import of My mystery to
the inhabitants of earth: both the law declaring by shadows and types that to
save the world I should even endure the death of the flesh, and abolish
corruption by rising from the dead; and the prophets also speaking words of the
same import as the writings of Moses. It is nothing strange therefore, He says,
or that was not known before, that you spurn My words, and despise everything
that would avail for your good. For the word of prophecy concerning Me, and
you, extends until the holy Baptist John: but ''from the days of John, the
kingdom of heaven is preached, and every one takes it by force." And by
the kingdom of heaven He here means justification by faith, the washing away of
sin by holy baptism, sanctification by the Spirit, worshipping in the Spirit,
the service that is superior to shadows and types, the honour of the adoption
of sons, and the hope of the glory about to be given to the saints.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
kingdom of heaven therefore, He says, is preached, for <a name="p521"><font color="#000000">|521</font></a>
the Baptist has stood forth in the midst saying, "Prepare you the way of
the Lord:" and has shown, that lo! He is already near, and as it were
within the doors, even the true Lamb of God, Who bears the sin of the world.
Whosoever therefore is a hearer and lover of the sacred message takes it by
force: by which is meant, that he uses all his earnestness and all his strength
in his desire to enter within the hope. For, as He says in another place,
"The kingdom of heaven is taken by violence and the violent seize upon
it."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"And
it is easier, He says, for heaven and earth to pass away, before the day that
God commands this to be, than for one point of the law to fall." Now
sometimes by the word <i>law </i>He signifies collectively the whole divinely
inspired Scripture, the writings, that is, of Moses and the prophets. What then
did it foretell, which must also necessarily reach its accomplishment? It
foretold, that by reason of their excessive unbelief and immorality, Israel
would fall from being of God's family, even though he be the eldest son: and
that Jerusalem would be thrust away from His indulgence and His love. For so He
spoke concerning it by the voice of Jeremiah, "Behold! I will hedge up her
way with stakes, and block up her ways, and she shall not find her path."
For the way of those who fear God is straight, nor is there any steep part
therein, but all is level and well beaten. But the path of the mother of the

that they were darkened in mind, and did not accept the light of the glory of
Christ,----for they knew Him not;----He before proclaimed saying unto the
multitude of the Jews; "I have likened your mother unto the night. My
people is like unto one that has no knowledge. Because you have rejected
knowledge, therefore will I reject you from being My priest. And you have
forgotten the law of your God, and I will forget your children." You hear
that the multitude of the disobedient are very justly compared unto darkness
and the night: for the intellectual day star, and the Sun of <a name="p522"><font color="#000000">|522</font></a>
righteousness arises and shines in the mind and heart of those who believe: but
the mind of those who treat with contumely a grace so splendid and worthy of
our possessing, is blackened in darkness, and intellectual gloom. And thus much
then concerning those things which the company of the holy prophets before
announced respecting Israel.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
unto those who have acknowledged the revelation of the glory of Christ the
Saviour of all, God the Father promised by one of the holy prophets, thus
saying; "And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and in the name
of their God they shall be established." And in accordance with this the
Psalmist also says in the Spirit unto our Lord Jesus Christ: "They shall
walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance: and in Your Name shall they
rejoice all the day. For you are the glory of their strength, and in Your
righteousness shall our horn be exalted." For we glory in Christ, and as
being justified by Him are exalted, having cast off the abasement of sin, and
living in the excellence of every virtue, we have been enriched also with the
exact and unadulterated knowledge of the doctrines of truth. For this God
promised us where He says by the voice of Isaiah, "And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not: and in paths which they have not known I
will make them walk. I will make their darkness to be light, and all their steep
places to be smooth." For we, who were once blind, have been enlightened,
and travel in an unwonted pathway of righteousness; while those who boasted of
the law as their schoolmaster, have become darkened. For as Christ Himself
said; "Darkness has blinded their eyes: and blindness in part has happened
unto Israel, that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not
hear." For they sinned against the holy prophets; and even ventured to
lift their hands against Him Who was calling them to salvation and life. Even
though therefore, He says, you be disobedient, and though you foolishly deride
My words, which would guide you in the attainment of that which is useful and
becoming, yet this conduct, He says, was not <a name="p523"><font color="#000000">|523</font></a> unforeknown,
but already had been declared by the law and the prophets. And it is a thing
impossible for the words of God to fail of their accomplishment: for He
declared that which He knew must altogether and necessarily happen.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>But there was a certain rich, man, and he was clothed in purple and fine
linen, feasting sumptuously every day. And a certain poor man whose name was
Lazarus had been laid at his gate, full of sores; and desiring to satisfy
himself with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs
came and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the poor man died, and the
angels carried him to Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died, and was
buried. And in Hades, having lifted up his eyes, being in torment, he saw
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue: for behold! I am tormented in this flame.
But Abraham said, Son, remember that you received your good things in your life
time; and Lazarus in like manner his evil things: but now he is comforted here,
and you are tormented. And besides all this, between us and you a great gulf is
placed, so that those who would pass from hence to you cannot; nor can those
pass who would come from thence unto us. And he said, I pray you, father, to
send him to my father's house: I have five brethren; that he may testify unto
them, lest they also come unto this place of torment. But Abraham said unto
him, They have Moses and the prophets: let them hear them. But he said, Nay,
father Abraham: but if one go unto them from the dead they will repent. But he
said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they would not be persuaded
even though one rose from the dead.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHEN
Solomon was offering up prayers in behalf of his kingdom, he somewhere said
unto God, "Give me wisdom, even that which abides by Your throne."
And God praised him for earnestly desiring such blessings as these; for there
is nothing better for men than sacred gifts: of which one worthy of our
acceptance, and that perfects in blessedness those who have been counted worthy
of it, is the wisdom which <a name="p525"><font color="#000000">|525</font></a> God bestows. For it is the
sight of the mind and heart, and the knowledge of every good and profitable
thing.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
it is our duty also to be enamoured of such gifts as these: that being counted
worthy thereof we may rightly and without error approach the Saviour's words.
For this is useful for us unto spiritual improvement, and leads unto a
praiseworthy and blameless life. Come therefore, that being made partakers of
the wisdom which is from above, we may examine the meaning of the parable now
set before us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
is necessary however, I think, in the first place to mention, what was the
occasion which led to His speaking of these things; or what Christ intended to
illustrate in so excellently sketching and describing the parable set before
us. The Saviour therefore was perfecting us in the art of well-doing, and commanding
us to walk uprightly in every good work, and to be in earnest in adorning
ourselves with the glories which arise from virtuous conduct. For He would have
us be lovers one of another, and ready to communicate: prompt to give, and
merciful, and careful of showing love to the poor, and manfully persisting in
the diligent discharge of this duty. And He especially admonished the rich in
this world to be careful in so doing, and to guide them into the way winch
altogether becomes the saints, He said, "Sell your possessions, and give
alms: make you purses that grow not old; a treasure that does not fail for ever
in heaven." Now the commandment indeed is beautiful, and good, and
salutary: but it did not escape His knowledge, that it is impossible for the majority
to practise it. For the mind of man has ever been, so to speak, infirm in the
discharge of those duties which are arduous and difficult: and to abandon
wealth and possessions and the enjoyment which they give, is not a thing very
acceptable to any, inasmuch as the mind is early clothed and entangled, as it
were, in indissoluble cords, which bind it to the desire of pleasure. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
being therefore good and loving unto men, He has provided for them a special
kind of help, lest eternal and never-ending poverty should follow upon wealth
here, and everlasting torment succeed to the pleasures of the present time.
"For make for yourselves friends, He says, of the unrighteous mammon: that
when it has failed, they may receive you into <a name="p526"><font color="#000000">|526</font></a> eternal
tabernacles.'" And this then is the advice of One providing them with
something which they can do. For if, He says, you cannot he persuaded to give
up this pleasure-loving wealth, and to sell your possessions, and make
distribution to those who are in need, at least be diligent in the practice of
inferior virtues." "Make for yourselves friends with the unrighteous
mammon:" that is, do not consider your riches as belonging to yourselves
alone; open wide your hand to those who are in need: assist those in poverty
and pain: comfort those who have fallen into extreme distress: condole with
those who are in sorrow, or oppressed with bodily maladies, and the want of
necessaries: and comfort also the saints who embrace a voluntary poverty that
they may serve God without distraction. Nor shall your so doing be unrewarded.
For when your earthly wealth abandons you, as you reach the end of your life,
then shall they make you partakers of their hope, and of the consolation given
them by God. For He being good and kind to man, will lovingly and bountifully
refresh those who have laboured in this world: and more especially such as have
wisely and humbly and soberly borne the heavy burden of poverty. And somewhat
similar advice the wise Paul also gives to those who live in wealth and abundance
respecting those in misery: "Your abundance shall be to supply their
falling short: in order that also their abundance may supply your falling
short." But this is the advice of one who enjoins that simply which Christ
spoke; "Make to yourselves friends of the unrighteous mammon:" so
that the commandment is well worthy of our admiration.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that our refusal so to act will cause our ruin, and bring us down to the
inextinguishable flame, and to an unavailing remorse, He plainly shows by
weaving for us the present parable. "For there was a certain rich man, He
says, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every
day. And a certain poor man whose name was Lazarus had been cast down at his
gate, full of sores."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Here
observe, I pray, and mark accurately the Saviour's words. For while it was easy
to have said, "That there was such and such a rich man whoever it might be

while He  <a name="p527"><font color="#000000">|527</font></a> mentions the poor man by name. What
conclusion therefore must we draw? That the rich man as being uncompassionate
was nameless in God's presence: for He has somewhere said by the voice of the
Psalmist, concerning those who do not fear Him, "I will not make mention
of their names with My lips:" while, as I said, the poor man is mentioned
by name by the tongue of God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
let us look at the pride of the rich man puffed up for things of no real
importance; "he was clothed, it says, in purple and fine linen," that
is, his study was to deck himself in beautiful attire, so that his raiment was
of great price, and he lived in never-ceasing banquetings; for such is the
meaning of his feasting every day: besides which it adds that he feasted
sumptuously, that is, prodigally. All the luxury therefore of that rich man
consisted in things of this sort: in clothing clean, delicate, and embroidered
with linen, and dyed with purple, so as to gratify the eyes of beholders. And what
is the result? Differing but little from the figures in statuary and painting,
the rich man is indeed admired by those who are destitute of sense, but his
heart is full of pride and haughtiness: he has high thoughts of himself and is
boastful, and while there is nothing of excellence in his mind, he makes
variously coloured hues a reason for his empty pride. His delight is in
expensive banquets; in music and revellings; he has numerous cooks, who labour
to provoke gluttony by carefully prepared meats: his cupbearers are beautifully
attired; he has singing men and singing women, and the voices of flatterers.
Such were the things in which the rich man lived; for the disciple of Christ
certifies us. saying, "that all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh,
and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Meanwhile
Lazarus, bound fast by sickness and poverty, was cast down, He says, at his
gate. For the rich man dwelt in lofty halls, and spacious mansions nobly built:
whereas the poor man was not so much laid as cast down, thrown there in
neglect, and not deemed worthy of any account. Cut off from compassion and
care, he would have liked, to satisfy his hunger, have gathered the worthless
morsels that fell from the rich man's table </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_11_sermons_110_123.htm#2" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>2</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">. He was tormented moreover by a severe and <a name="p528"><font color="#000000">|528</font></a>
incurable malady; "Yes, even the dogs, it says, licked his sores,"
and that, as it seems, not to injure him, but rather, so to speak, as
sympathizing with him, and tending him: for with their tongues they allay their
own sufferings, removing with them that which pains them, and gently soothing
the sore.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
the rich man was more cruel than the beasts; for he felt neither sympathy for
him nor compassion; but was full of all mercilessness. And what the result was,
the outline of the parable teaches us in what follows: but it is too long to
tell it now. For lest my discourse should prove more than sufficient for my
hearers, and a fatigue beyond due measure to him who speaks, stopping now from
a due regard for the good both of myself and you, I will speak to you again
upon these things at our next meeting, if Christ our common Saviour grant me
the ability so to do: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and

blessed prophet Isaiah has somewhere introduced those who by faith in Christ
have been won unto life, as calling out eagerly, so to speak, unto one another,
and saying; "Come, let us go up unto the mountain of the Lord, and unto
the house of the God of Jacob, and they shall teach us His way, and we will
walk in it." Now by the mountain here we affirm to be meant not any
earthly mountain; for to imagine this would be foolish: but rather the church
which Christ has rescued for Himself. For it is high and conspicuous to people
everywhere, and, so to say, exalted, because there is nothing in it which
brings men down to earth. For those who dwell within it care nothing for the
things of earth, but rather desire those things that are above: and, as the
Psalmist says, "They are exalted far above the earth;" as being
altogether brave and courageous, and practising uninterrupted endeavours after
all things whatsoever which please God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

such we believe you to be; and your earnest desire after instruction is a plain
proof thereof. For you have come of course to seek the fulfilment of the
promise given unto you: but neither have we forgotten what we promised, but pay
our debt, adding on to what has been already said that which is still wanting
to the parable of Lazarus and the rich man.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"For
it came to pass, He says, that Lazarus died, and was carried by angels to
Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried." Observe
carefully the Saviour's words. For of the poor man, He says, that he was
carried by angels to Abraham's bosom: but of the rich man there is nothing of
the sort, but only that he died and was buried. For those who have hope towards
God find in their departure from the world a deliverance from anguish and pain.
And something like this Solomon also has taught us, saying, "In the sight
of men they seemed to die, and their departure was considered an injury and
their going from among us a breaking to pieces: but they are at peace, and
their hope is full of <a name="p530"><font color="#000000">|530</font></a> immortality." For there is
given unto them a measure of consolation commensurate with their labours: or
even perhaps one which surpasses and exceeds their toils: for Christ has
somewhere said, that "good measure, pressed down, and heaped up, and
running over shall they give into your bosom." For like as ships that sail
upon the sea stand the shock of savage waves, and struggle with the violence of
mighty winds, but afterwards arriving at tranquil havens fit for their rest,
cease there from tossing; so in like manner I think that the souls of men, when
they emerge from the turbulence of earthly things, enter the mansions that are
above, as into a haven of salvation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

then, He says, was carried by the holy angels unto Abraham's bosom: but the
rich man died and was buried." For to that rich man who had shewn himself
harsh and unmerciful the separation from the body was death. For he was going
from pleasure to torment: from glory to shame: from light to darkness. Such
were the things that the rich man must suffer, who had been voluptuous, and
close-handed, and unready for mercy. And to torment him the more now that he
dwells in Hades, he beheld, it says, Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham: and made
supplication that he might be sent to drop a little water upon his tongue: for
he was tormented, it says, as in a fierce flame. And what reply does the
patriarch Abraham make? "Son, you received your good things in your life:
and Lazarus his evil things." You were enamoured, He says, of these temporal
things; you were clad in fine linen and purple </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_11_sermons_110_123.htm#4" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>IMPORTANT:

beheld the man suffering incurable misery, and a prey to intolerable griefs: for
two maladies at once possessed him, <a name="p531"><font color="#000000">|531</font></a> each worse than the
other, the cruel pain of his ulcers, and the want of the necessaries of life.
The very beasts soothed Lazarus, because he was in pain; "the dogs licked
his sores," but you were more hard-hearted than the beasts. "You have
received therefore, He says, your good things in your life, and Lazarus his
evil: and now here he is comforted, and you are tormented;" and, as the
sacred Scripture says, "they shall have judgment without mercy who have
wrought no mercy." You would have been a partner with Lazarus, and a

us therefore make for ourselves friends of the unrighteous mammon: let us
listen to Moses and the prophets calling us unto mutual love and brotherly
affection: let us not wait for any of those now in Hades to return hither to
tell us the torments there: the sacred Scripture is necessarily true: we have
heard, that "Christ shall sit upon the throne of His glory to judge the
world in righteousness, and that He shall set the sheep indeed on His right
hand, but the goats on His left. And to those on His right hand He shall say,
Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
before the foundations of the world: for I was hungry, and you gave Me to eat;
and thirsty also, and you gave Me to drink: I was naked, and you clothed Me; in
prison, and you came unto Me." But upon those upon the left hand He shall
lay a heavy condemnation, saying, "Go to the eternal fire prepared for the
devil and his angels." And the charge against them is, that they have done
the very opposite of that for which the saints were praised. "For I was
hungry, and you gave Me not to eat; and thirsty, and you gave Me not to drink:
for inasmuch as you did it not, He says, to one of these little ones, you did
it not to Me."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to this perhaps some one will object, that there are many kinds of well living;
for virtue is diversified, so to speak, and manifold: why therefore, having
omitted those other kinds, does He make mention only of love to the poor? To
this we reply, that the act is better than any other kind of <a name="p532"><font color="#000000">|532</font></a>
well doing: for it works in our souls a certain divine likeness which moulds
us, so to speak, after God's image. For Christ also has said, "Be you
merciful, as your Father also in heaven is merciful," He who is quick to
show mercy, and compassionate and kind, is ranked with the true worshippers;
for it is written, that "a pure and unpolluted sacrifice to God the Father
is this, to visit orphans and widows in their poverty, and that a man keep
himself unspotted from the world." And the wise Paul also has somewhere
written, "But alms and communication forget not: for with such sacrifices
God is content." For He loves not the incense of the legal worship, but
requires rather the pleasantness of the sweet spiritual savour. But the sweet
spiritual savour unto God is to show pity unto men, and to maintain love
towards them. This also Paul advises us, saying, "Owe no man anything, but
that you love one another:" and the daughter of love is pity for poverty.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

be the one who announces the Kingdom of God, the precepts of the Gospel
indicate it: without stick, without wallet, without shoe, without bread,
without money, that is to say, not seeking the help of the the resources of
this world, abandoned to faith, and counting that the less he seeks the
temporal goods, the more they may fall to him. We can, if we wish, hear all
this in the following sense: this passage would aim to form a spiritual state
of mind, which seems to have stripped the body as a garment, not only by
renouncing power and despising the riches, but even excluding the attractions
of the flesh. Above all, they are given a general recommendation of peace and
constancy: they will bring peace, keep the constancy, observe the rules of the
law of hospitality: it is not suitable for the preacher of the kingdom of
heaven, affirms to run from house to house, and to modify the inviolable laws
of hospitality. But just as it is supposed that they will be offered the
benefit of hospitality, so, if they are not received, they are ordered to shake
off the dust and leave the city; which teaches us that good hospitality is not
a small reward: not only do we provide peace to our guests, but if they are
covered with the light dust of faults, receiving the footsteps of the apostolic
preachers removes them. And it is not without reason that in Matthew the Apostles
are commanded to choose the house where they will enter, so that they have
nothing to change and to violate the rights of hospitality. It is not
recommended, however, the same precaution to the one who receives the host, for
fear that choosing the host will not restrict hospitality.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> But
if we have here, in the literal sense, the content of a venerable precept which
touches on the religious character of hospitality, the mysterious and spiritual
interpretation smiles upon us. When we choose a house, we look for a worthy
guest. Let us see then if it would not be the Church which is designated to our
preference, and Christ. Is it home more worthy to welcome apostolic preachers
than the holy Church? who, to be preferred to all, has more titles than Christ?
He is accustomed to washing his feet to his guests, and from the moment that he
receives in his house, he does not suffer to be sojourned with soiled feet,
but, however meager of life, II deign to clean them for the rest of the
journey. It is therefore He alone that no one must leave, of which no one must
change. He is rightly told, "Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words
of eternal life, and we believe "(Jn, VI, 69-70). Do you see how He
(Peter) executes the heavenly precepts? for not having changed hotels, he
deserved to have his share of celestial consecration. It is, therefore, first
and foremost to inquire into the faith of a Church: if Christ is its
inhabitant, it must certainly be chosen; but if a people of evil faith or a
heretical doctor disfigures the dwelling, it is ordered to avoid the communion
of heretics, to flee this synagogue. We must shake off the dust of the feet,
lest the drought of a bad and sterile faith defile, like an arid and sandy
soil, the march of your mind. 5. For if the preacher of the Gospel is to take
upon him the bodily infirmities of the faithful people, to take away and to
make disappear as they do their vain, dust-like actions - as it is written:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Who
is sick without me being ill? (II Cor., XI, 29) - He must also abandon any
Church that repels the faith and does not have the foundations of apostolic
preaching, for fear of being spattered and defiled by false faith. The Apostle,
in his turn, clearly states: "Avoid, he says, the heretic, after a single
warning" (Tit., III, 10).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

he said to them, Give them food for themselves, and they say, We have not more
than five loaves." What is the reason why, John's passion being told
below, right now Herod's words show him already dead (IX, 9)? perhaps because
after the end of the Law the food of the Gospel began to feed the hungry hearts
of peoples? Moreover, it is after the one who is the figure of the Church has
been healed of her blood loss, after the Apostles were sent to announce the
Kingdom of God, that the food of heavenly grace is distributed. But notice to
whom it is distributed: not to the nonchalant ones, not to those who live in
the city - as in the Synagogue or in the dignities of the century - but to
those who seek Christ in the desert; those who do not disgust themselves, these
are welcomed by Christ, and the Word of God converses with them, not of the
world, but of the kingdom of heaven; and if there are any that cover the ulcers
of a bodily malady, he willingly gives them his remedy. It was thus in order
that, having cured them of their painful wounds, He would deliver them from
hunger by spiritual foods. Thus no one receives the food of Christ unless he
has been healed first, and those who are invited to the feast are healed
beforehand by the invitation: was there a lame man, he received the means of to
walk to come; a man deprived of the light of his eyes, he was obviously able to
enter the house of the Lord only if he regained his sight. Everywhere,
therefore, a mysterious order is observed: first, the remission of sins is a
remedy for wounds, and the food of the celestial table is multiplied. Yet this
crowd is not yet nourished by the most substantial dishes; hearts that fast
with strong faith can not feast on the body and blood of Christ: "I made
you drink milk," he says, "not food: you were not yet able to, and
even now you are not yet "(I Cor. III, 2). The five loaves correspond to
the milk; solid food is the body of Christ, the generous beverage is the blood
of the Lord. It is not from the outset that we eat everything or drink all
things. "Drink this first," he says. So there is one thing, there is
a second to drink. There is also a first thing to eat, there is also a second,
there is a third. First there are five loaves, in the second place seven, in
the third the body of Christ. So let us not abandon such a Master at any price,
who deigns to distribute food to us according to the strength of each one, lest
the weak should be overwhelmed by food that is too solid, or that light food
should not satisfy the strong; for "he who is sick must eat
vegetables" (Rom. xiv. 2), and he who already seems to be escaping from
the shackles of infirmity will eat of these five loaves and two fishes. At
least, if he is afraid to ask for food, let him give up all his possessions and
hurry to the word of God: beginning to hear, he begins to be hungry; the
Apostles begin to see this hungry; Even though they do not yet understand what
he is hungry for, Christ understands him: He knows that he is not hungry for
material food, but for the food of Christ. Let him say, "I do not want to
send them away fasting, lest they fail on the way" (Matt. XV, 32). Good
master, He demands zeal, provides strength. If you would not, Lord Jesus, leave
them fasting with me, but feed them with the food you distribute, so that
strengthened by your food they may not fear the weakness of fasting! If you
said of us too, "I do not want to send them away on an empty stomach! Tell
me again why you do not want to send them away fasting; or rather, as you have
already said: the one you send back on a fasting day fails on the way, that is
to say, fails either in the course of this life, or before reaching the end of
the road, before reaching to the Father and to understand that Christ comes
from the Father, before understanding that Christ comes from heaven, to
understand that the Christ who descended from it is the same who ascended to it
(Ephesians 4: 10), lest Having learned that he was born of a Virgin, he does
not take the liberty of judging that his power is not divine, but human.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

they do not fail, "give them yourselves to eat," says II. But they
said, "We do not have more than five loaves and two fish unless we go and
buy food for the whole crowd. The Apostles had not yet understood that the food
of the believing people is not an object of sale. Christ knew it: He knew that
it was us rather that had to be redeemed, and that his feast was free. The
disciples did not yet have the food that could redeem us; they had already the
food that could satiate us, they had the food that could strengthen us, because
"the bread fortifies the heart of man" (Ps 103, 15). The Lord has
mercy, so that no one will fail on the way. If, therefore, anyone fails, it is
not because of the Lord Jesus, but by his doing to him that he fails, and you
have nothing to impute to the Lord, who "triumphs when he is judged"
(Ps. 50, 6). What will you say to Him who has given you all the strength of
your strength? Is it not He who begot you, who nourished you? his food is
strong, his food is courage. But if you, by your negligence, have wasted the
strength you have received, it is not the help of heavenly foods that you have
missed, but those of your soul. The Lord, just as He rains upon the just and
the unjust (Matt. V, 45), also nourishes the unjust and the just. Is it not on
the strength of the food that Elijah the saint, already failing on the way,
walked forty days (I Kings, XIX, 6 ff.)? and this food is an angel who gave it
to him. But you, if Christ feeds you, and if you keep the food thus received,
you will walk not for forty days and forty nights, but, I dare say it based on
the examples of Scripture, for forty years, from your out of the borders of
Egypt until you arrive in the land of abundance, in the land where milk and
honey flow, and which the Lord swore to give to our fathers (Ex., III, 8, XIII
, 5). It is the earth of which you must seek the resources, the one which the
sweetness possesses (Matth., XII, 43): not this earth, I say, which is
desiccated, but that which is enriched with the food of Christ, who, subject to
the authority of the eternal King, is inhabited by the crowd of saints. Christ
therefore shares the food. And He, no doubt, wants to give to all, do not deny
anyone, for He is the provider of all; but when He breaks the loaves and gives
them to the disciples, if you do not stretch out your hands to receive your
food, you will fail on the way. And you will not be able to blame him: He has
mercy and distributes; but He gives to those who dwell with Him, even in the
wilderness, who go neither the first nor the second nor the third day; for you
read elsewhere: "I have pity on this crowd, for it has been three days
since they continued to be with me" (Matt., XV, 32). What condescension,
what humanity is by him inspired to men! He does not want to let them go on an
empty stomach; He does not want it, lest they fail on the way. Do not fail then
under the correction of God; do not be weary of being taken back by Him; do not
get tired now, for fear of being tired later. What will you answer to Him, or
how will you excuse yourself, if you have let the strength of the food that he
provides loses? You can not say that he did not give food, since he gives it to
everyone. You can not say that he did not want you to do good, having proposed
good and evil, so that your good action would not be constrained, but voluntary
(Philém., 14). For there is a great difference between the one who acts by
constraint and in spite of himself, and the one who voluntarily chooses what is
good: "if I do it out of necessity, it is a charge entrusted to me; if it
is of my own free will, I will have a reward "(I Cor., IX, 17). Consider,
then, that we shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and that, if our
work burns (I Cor., III, 15), we shall have nothing to excuse ourselves; for he
will tell us what he said before by the Prophet: "My people, what have I
done to you, or what have I done to you? answer me "(Mich., VI, 3). He
will say to him who has fallen on the road: How did you come down on the road?
have I not made loaves, have I not blessed them, have I not given them to you?
but you, why did not you want to receive them? How many who are present here
will fail along the way, even after these discourses which, to be ours, must
nevertheless be considered as loaves, since "no one can name the Lord
Jesus except by the Holy Spirit" ( I Cor., XII, 3)! How many, I say, will
faint and go to the paths of the pagans by cross roads, fornicators! and please
God that there was only one, not a great number! But it is not Jesus who is the
cause of failure, even if such a failure: for He distributes to all those who
follow Him, that there are five thousand or four thousand. The number is not
indifferent, the order is not indifferent, the remains of those who eat are not
indifferent. Why in fact the most numerous, that is to say, five thousand, are
they satisfied with five loaves, or a smaller number, and the least numerous,
which are four thousand, are they fed with seven loaves of bread? that is, a
higher number? To hold on to the miraculous fact alone, the divine is more
visible if a lesser measure has been abundant for a greater number. Why then,
what is less, is it added to the greater, as if it carried it away? for we read
first that five thousand were satisfied with five loaves, and four thousand
with seven loaves. Let us seek, then, the mystery which prevails over the
miracle.180 Therefore, the five thousand seem to be, as the five senses of the
body, having received from Christ food still within the reach of the carnal; as
for the four thousand, although they are still in the body, and in this world
which is composed of four elements, it is however not without motive that they
received, it is said, the food of the mysterious rest they are already equal to
the world, they who will be above the world, for although they are in this
world, they are not yet shut up in the world. The food of the mysterious rest
is distributed to them: for in six days the world has been made, the seventh
has been a day of rest, and the Lord has sanctified it.2 Beyond the world is
rest, therefore, beyond the world also the fruit of rest. Also "happy are
the peaceful ones, for they are the ones who will be called children of
God" (Matt, V, 9). For God being above the world, no one can surely see
God if he does not go beyond the world by the spiritual gaze. Thus the seventh
bliss is for the pacified; there are also seven baskets of debris for the four
thousand. It is not a small thing that this bread of Sabbaths, hallowed bread,
bread of rest. And perhaps, if you start eating the five loaves with your
senses, I will dare to say: after the five loaves and the seven, in the third
place it is not on earth that you will eat the bread, but higher than the earth
you will eat eight loaves, as those who are in heaven; for as the seven loaves
are the bread of rest, so the eight loaves are the bread of the resurrection.
So those who were fed bread had persevered for three days, and perhaps obtained
the full faith and assurance of the coming resurrection. So it is the saints
who say, "We will walk three days, to feast with our God" (Ex., V,
3). But that will come in his place. As for the five loaves, St. John taught me
what I did not know, which Matthew did not teach me, nor did he teach me S.
Luke? because everyone has received a different grace? ; he taught me, I say,
that these five loaves were of barley. It was not unreasonable to say that this
food was within the reach of the carnal. Why in the first place barley bread?
because we must first feed milk, then meat, who comes to faith; because
"we could not yet" (see I Cor., III, 2-3), and perhaps many of us can
not yet; because as long as there are quarrels and disagreements among us, are
not we carnal and we lead in a human way? The food is adapted to the strength
of each: also the barley first, then the wheat is given to us in food, while in
the strongest? like Elijah (I Kings, XVII, 12)? a loaf of flour made of the
marrow of wheat is served, which sinners can not feed. It is not only with
regard to the bread, as to the number, but in the installation that there is a
difference: these are seated on the grass, these on the ground; the five
thousand on the grass, the four thousand on the ground. Fouling the earth is
more than being laid on the grass: those whose senses are still carnal like
softness and therefore sit on the grass? for all flesh is grass (Is., XL, 6);
for others, it is on the earth, producing wheat, wine, and olive, that they
obtain the food of grace. Some are seated, others are stretched out, for one
lies more extended. There are two fish here, we do not count: so many thought
that the grace of the Spirit to the seven gifts was determined in the loaves,
and that the fish of the two Testaments should be understood in fish. It does
not, therefore, repugnant to us to calculate that the four thousand, gathered
together from the four corners of the world and representing the Church,
receive the food of a greater grace, as it is written: "It will come from
the East. and from the west and from the north and from the south, and they
will sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven "</font></span><font face="Calibri" size="3">
</font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">(Matt., VIII, 11). This is
what Christ gives thanks to the Father, for it is not in vain that elsewhere
there is only blessing, here also thanksgiving (Jn, VI, 11). Yes, the Lord is
accustomed to give thanks to the Father for his Church, because he has revealed
to the little ones what he has hidden from the sages (Matt. XI, 25). The
blessing is therefore for us who are less elevated, the thanksgiving for those
who have triumphed over the weaknesses of their bodies by the holy martyr. We
have already touched on this point above: when seated by fifty, no doubt this
number is sacred, but it is determined; it seems that here we have the people
of a stronger Church, which takes place without determination of numbers.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> There
is still mystery in the fact that the people eat and are satisfied, and that
the Apostles do the service. For satiety indicates and shows hunger banished
forever, because one will not be hungry once received the food of Christ; and
service by the Apostles foresaw the distribution of the body and blood of the
Lord. But the divine is that the five loaves were sufficient, and beyond, for
five thousand people: for it is clear that it is not this small food, but its
multiplication, which has satisfied the people. You would have seen, as if by
an irreproachable irrigation, to yield in the hands of the distributors parcels
which they had not broken, and, without the fingers having touched them to
break them, the pieces to escape spontaneously. When one reads such things, how
can one be astonished at the perpetual motion of the waters, be astonished
that, from liquid sources, the waves follow each other incessantly, when the
bread itself overflows, and when a solid matter spreads in abundance? This has
been done to make us see the very things we do not see. By some He manifestly
manifested that he is also the author of others and the Creator of all material
nature, which, not found, as the philosophers want, but made, provides his
successive contributions to the production of all things. 86. This is
surprising: everything you draw from streams is not recorded and marked as an
expense; everything you take at the fountains is replaced by a movement of
income. But even the rivers themselves, if they seem to lose nothing, gain
nothing; and as for the fountains, if we see the waters accumulate there, so we
realize when the waters diminish. But this bread that breaks Jesus is, as to
the mystery, the word of God and the discourse on Christ: distributed, it
increases; for with a few speeches He has provided all the peoples with an
abundant food; He gave us speeches like loaves, and while we taste them they
multiply in our mouths. In the same way, visibly and unbelievably, this bread,
when broken, when it is distributed, when eaten, crams without any diminution.
And do not doubt that this food increases either in the hands that distribute
it, or in the mouths that eat it, since in all this the testimony of our
activity is invoked to strengthen our faith. It is thus that at the wedding the
waters take the color of the wine while the servants act, and even those who
filled the jars with water drew a wine which they had not brought (Jn, II, 6
sqq. .). Understand, if you can, such miraculous realities. Here, while the
crowds are eating, the pieces are increasing as they spend themselves, and from
five loaves more remains are gathered than the whole; here, the elements change
species, and nature does not suffer from diminution and does not recognize its
products, while recognizing its own uses. Moreover, the wine of transmutation
is of better quality than the natural wine, because it is in the power of the
Creator and to serve the species for the uses of his choice, and to give to the
beings to come their nature. See by what works He proves his work: while the
servant pours the water, the decadent bouquet intoxicates, the modified color
commands the claim, the flavor of the beverage is the height. That the
Gentiles, if they please, compare with the blessings of Christ not the deeds,
but the fictions of their gods! Their fables in fact report that there was a
king who changed into gold all that he touched; but the feasts themselves were
fatal to him: the napkins themselves, seized by his fingers, hardened, and the
food crunched in his mouth, giving him not food, but wounds, and the drink
clung to his throat, unable to neither penetrate nor retreat. Benefits worthy
of his desires! present worthy of such a solicitor! a gift worthy of the donor!
Such are the benefits of idols: when they seem to be of service, they are only
more harmful. On the contrary, the benefits of Christ seem small, and are very
great. It is not only to one, but to the crowds, that he grants them. The food
increased in the mouths of the eaters; and it seemed that it was nourishment
for the body, but it was taken for eternal salvation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> But
why is there more for the five thousand, less for the four thousand? Because
these four thousand spent three days with Christ, and therefore received more
from the heavenly food. And it is not without reason that the remnant of the
crowd are gathered by the disciples, because you will be able to find the
things of God more easily in the elect than in the crowds. Would it please God
to hear: Gather what remains!</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">If I hear
it, and if I do, I will have many things that the crowds, many things that
children and women could not eat. Happy who can collect what leave the learned
themselves! Let's see how he gathers. The Law said: You will not be adulterous.
Christ broke this bread, he shared this word, without adding to it, but
distributing his own. "To look," he says, "for a woman to covet
her, is to have already committed adultery on her" (Matt. V, 28): here is
a piece that comes from Him. He added, "If your right eye scandalizes you,
tear it off" (Matt, V, 29). Here is another: "If your right hand
scandalizes you, cut it off" (Ib., 30) and "to marry the one sent
back by her husband is to commit adultery" (Ib., 32). See how many
fragments with one! Moses said that Abraham had two sons, one of the servant
and the other of the free woman. (Gen., XXI, 2, 9). Paul said, "These are
the two Testaments" (Gal., IV, 24): He shared this word and found the
mystery. Happy then who gathers what Christ has shared! But why did Christ fill
twelve baskets? Is it not to put an end to this test of the Jewish people
"His hands have served with the basket" (Ps 80.7)? in other words,
the people who previously gathered the mud in the baskets now obtain the food
of the heavenly life by the cross of Christ, and collect the food of faith in
what contained the mire of pagan unbelief. And this is not the boon of a small
number, but of all; for by the twelve baskets it is like the strengthening of
each tribe in the faith which overflows, since "the bread strengthens the
heart of man" (Ps 103, 15).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

opinion of the crowd is not without interest: some believed in the resurrection
of Elijah, which they thought should come, the others of John, whom they knew
to be beheaded, or of one of the ancient prophets . But to seek that is above
us: it is for the thought of another, the prudence of another. For if it is
enough for the apostle Paul to know only Christ Jesus, and crucified (I Cor.,
II, 2), what do I have to wish to know in addition to Christ? in this name
alone is expressed the divinity, and the Incarnation, and the reality of the Passion.
Also, although the other apostles know it, Peter, however, responds, preferably
to all: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. He has therefore
embraced all things, expressing both nature and the name which summarizes the
virtues. Shall we raise questions about the generation of God, when Paul judged
that he knows nothing apart from Christ Jesus, and crucified, when Peter
thought he had to confess only the Son of God? we seek, with the eyes of human
weakness, when and how He was born, and what is His greatness. Paul recognized
in all this the pitfall of questions rather than a profit for edification, and
therefore decided to know nothing but Christ Jesus. Peter knew that in the Son
of God are all things, for "the Father gave everything to the Son"
(Jn, III, 35): if he gave all, he transmitted the eternity and the majesty he
possesses. But why leave me so far? the end of my faith is Christ, the end of
my faith is the Son of God; I am not allowed to know the process of his
generation, but I am not allowed to ignore the reality of his generation.
Believe, then, in the way that Peter believed, so that you too may be happy to
deserve to hear, "For it is not flesh and blood that has revealed it to
you, but my Father who is in heaven ". Indeed flesh and blood can only
reveal the earthly; on the other hand, he who speaks of mysteries in spirit
does not rely on the teaching of flesh and blood, but on divine inspiration. So
do not rest on flesh and blood, for fear of taking the orders of flesh and blood,
and becoming yourself blood and flesh. For who is attached to the flesh, is
flesh, and "who is attached to God is one spirit" (with Him) (I Cor.,
VI, 17). "My spirit," said He, "will never remain with these
men, because they are carnal" (Gen. VI, 3). But please God that those who
hear are not flesh and blood, but stranger to the lusts of flesh and blood,
everyone can say: I will not be afraid of what the flesh will do to me (Ps 55:
5)! Whoever has conquered the flesh is a foundation of the Church, and if he
can not match Peter, he can imitate him. For the gifts of God are great: not
only has He restored what was ours, but He has conceded to us that which is His
own.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> It
is interesting, however, to wonder why the crowds did not see in Him another
than Elijah, or Jeremiah, or John the Baptist. Elijah perhaps because he was
taken to heaven; but Christ is not Elijah: one is taken away, the other comes
back; one, I say, is taken away, the other did not think to take away his
equality with God (Phil., II, 6); one is avenged by the flames he calls (I
Kings, XVIII, 38), the other has preferred to heal his persecutors than to lose
them. But why did they believe Jeremiah? perhaps because he was sanctified from
the womb. But it's not about Jeremiah. One is sanctified, the other sanctifies;
the sanctification of one began with his body, the other is Saint of the Saint.
Why do the people still believe him John? would it not be because, being in the
bosom of his mother, he perceived the presence of the Lord? But this is not
John: one adored being in the womb, the other was worshiped; one was baptizing
in water, Christ in the Spirit; one counseled penance, the other forgave sins.
So Peter did not wait for the opinion of the people, but expressed his own,
saying: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. The one who is,
always is, did not begin to be, and never ceases to be. The goodness of Christ
is great: almost all his names, He gave them to his disciples. "I
am," he says, "the light of the world" (Jn, VIII, 12); and yet,
that name of which He glorifies Himself, He granted it to His disciples,
saying, "You are the light of the world" (Matt., V, 14). "I am
the living bread" (Jn, VI, 51); and "we are all one bread" (I
Cor., X, 17). "I am the true vine" (Jn, XV, I); and He says to you,
"I have planted you as a fruitful, all-true vine" (Jer., II, 21).
Christ is stone? "They drank the spiritual stone that accompanied them,
and the stone was Christ" (I Cor., X, 4)? Nor did he refuse the grace of
this name to his disciple, so much so that he is Peter too, because he will
have steadfastness, firmness in faith. Strive, therefore, to be a stone in your
turn: therefore seek the stone not outside, but in you. Your stone is your
action; your stone is your spirit. It is on this stone that your home is built
so that no storm of evil spirits can overthrow it. Your stone is faith; faith
is the foundation of the Church. If you are stone, you will be in the Church,
since the Church rests on stone. If you are in the Church, the gates of hell will
not triumph over you: the gates of hell are the gates of death, and the gates
of death can not be the gates of the Church. But what are the gates of death,
in other words the gates of hell, if not the various kinds of sins? If you
fornicate, you have passed the gates of death. If you hurt good faith, you have
gone through the gates of hell. If you have committed a mortal sin, you have
passed the gates of death. But God has the power to raise you from the gates of
death, so that you proclaim all his praise at the gates of the daughter of Zion
(Ps 9, 14). As for the gates of the Church, these are the gates of chastity,
the gates of justice, which the righteous have accustomed to cross: "Open
to me," he says, "the gates of justice, and, having crossed them I
will praise the Lord "(Psalm 117: 19). But as the door of death is the
door of hell, the door of justice is the door of God; for "Behold, the
gate of the Lord, the righteous will come in" (Ib., 20). So run away from
stubbornness in sin, so that the gates of hell can not triumph over you: for if
sin is master of you, the door of death has triumphed. Flee the quarrels, the
dissensions, the noisy and tumultuous discords, so as not to come to pass the
gates of death. For the Lord Jesus did not at first want to be published, to
cause no tumult: He enjoins his disciples to tell no one that "the Son of
man must suffer much, be reproved by the priests of priests. the elders and the
scribes, to be put to death and to rise again on the third day "(Lk. IX,
22). And perhaps the Lord added this because he knew how much trouble his
followers would have to believe in the Passion and the Resurrection; then He
preferred to affirm Himself His Passion and Resurrection, for the event to give
birth to faith, and not its announcement of disagreement. So Christ did not
want to boast, but He preferred to appear without glory to suffer; and you, who
are born without glory, do you boast? it is by the way in which Christ walked
that you must go forward. It is to recognize it, to imitate it in ignominy and
good renown (see II Cor., VI, 8), to glorify you by the Cross, as He Himself
boasted. Such was Paul's conduct, and he boasted of it: "For me,"
said he, "God forbid that I should boast other than the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ" (Gal. Vi. 14). .</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But let us
see why, according to Matthew (XVI, 20), we find that the disciples are warned
not to tell anyone that he is the Christ, whereas here it is enjoined, it is
written, to tell no one that he must suffer much and rise again. You see that
in the name of Christ alone there is everything. It is Christ who was born of a
Virgin, who did wonders before the people, who died for our sins and rose from
the dead. To cut off one of these things is to cut off your salvation. For even
the heretics seem to have Christ with them: no one denies the name of Christ;
but it is to deny Christ that he does not recognize all that belongs to Christ.
For many reasons, therefore, He commands his disciples to be silent: to deceive
the devil, to avoid ostentation, to teach humility, and also so that his
disciples, still rude and imperfect, are not crushed under the burden of a
complete announcement.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Let us now
examine for what motive He also commands impure spirits to be silent. But that
even Scripture has discovered to us, because "God says to the sinner: why
do you tell my righteousness" (Ps 49, 16)? lest by hearing him preach, one
should follow his bewilderment; for he is a bad master to the devil, and he
often mixes the false and the true, to cover his fraudulent testimony with the
appearances of the truth. Consider this again: is it now the first time he
recommends to the disciples to tell no one that he is the Christ? or did He
recommend it when He sent the Twelve Apostles and commanded them, "Do not
go in the direction of the Gentiles, and do not enter the cities of the
Samaritans; but go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, heal the sick,
cleanse the lepers, cast out demons "; and "inquire of a worthy
person, and dwell at home" (Matt. x. 5 ff.). Thus in this place, too, we
do not see that it is prescribed to preach Christ the Son of God. There is
therefore an order for discussion, an order for the exposition; and therefore
we, too, when Gentiles are called to the Church, must regulate the order of the
recommendations in such a way as to first teach that there is one God, the
author of the world and all things, who we live, exist and move, and of the
race of who we are (Acts, XVII, 28): so that we must love him not only for the
benefits of light and life, but also to because of a certain race kinship. Then
we will destroy the idea that they have idols, because the matter of gold,
silver or wood can not have in it a divine energy. Having convinced them of the
existence of a single God, you will be able to prove to Him that salvation has
been given to us by Christ, beginning with what he has accomplished in his body
and showing the divine character, so to show in Him more than a man, death
conquered by the strength of one, and this dead man risen from hell. It is,
indeed, little by little that faith grows: seeing that he is more than a man,
it is believed that he is God; for unless you prove that he could not
accomplish these things without a divine power, how can you demonstrate that
there was a divine energy in him? But we may be given little authority and no
credence: read the Apostle's address to the Athenians. If he had wanted to
destroy the idolatrous ceremonies from the outset, the pagan ears would have
rejected his word. He therefore begins with one God, the craftsman of the
world, saying, "God who made the world and all that is in it" (Act.
XVII, 24).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">They could
not deny that there was one craftsman in the world, one God, one Creator of all
things. He added that the Master of heaven and earth does not consent to dwell
in the works of our hands; then that it is not probable that human art
imprisoned in the vain matter of gold and silver the power of divinity; the
remedy for this error, he said, is zeal to repent. Then he comes to Christ; yet
he did not want to call it God rather than men "In the man, he said, he
has appointed to the faith of all men by raising him from the dead. Indeed, he
who discourses must have regard to the people who hear him, not to be mocked
before being heard. How the Athenians would they believed the Word was made
flesh, and a Virgin conceived of the Spirit, who mocked them when they had
heard about resurrection of the dead? Yet Dionysius the Areopagite believed,
and others believed this man to believe in God. What does the order in which
everyone believes matter? we do not ask for perfection from the beginning, but
from the beginning we arrive at perfection. He therefore instructed the
Athenians according to this principle, and this is the order we must keep with
the Gentiles. But when the Apostles addressed the Jews, they said that Christ
is the One who was promised to us by the oracles of the Prophets. They did not
call immediately and on their own authority Son of God, but one approved, a
just man, a man raised from the dead, the man he had said in the prophets:
"You are my Son; it is I who today have begotten you "(Ps 2, 7). So
you also, produce in support of difficult things to believe the authority of
God's word, and show that his coming was promised by the voices of the
prophets; teach that his resurrection was also affirmed, long beforehand, by
the testimonies of the Scriptures? not the one that is normal and common to
all? in order to obtain, by establishing his bodily resurrection, a testimony
of his divinity. Having been found that the bodies of others suffer corruption
after death, for the One whom it is said (Ps. 15, 10) you recognize the
exemption of human frailty, you find that it exceeds the characteristics of
human nature and must be closer to God rather than men. If it is a question of
teaching a catechumen who aspires to the sacraments of the faithful, it must be
said that there is one God, of whom are all things, and one Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things (I Cor., VIII, 6); that it is not necessary to speak of two
Lords; that the Father is perfect, perfect also the Son, but that the Father
and the Son have the same substance; that the eternal Word of God, a word not
uttered, but acting, is begotten of the Father, not produced by his word.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> It
is forbidden for the Apostles to announce him as the Son of God, so that they
may announce him crucified later. It is the splendor of faith, to really
understand the cross of Christ. The other crosses serve me nothing; only the
cross of Christ is useful to me, and really useful: through it "the world
was crucified for me, and I for the world" (Gal., VI, 14). If the world is
crucified for me, I know that it is dead: I do not love it; I know he is
passing: I do not covet him; I know that corruption will devour this world: I avoid
it as smelly, I flee like the plague, I desert it as being able to harm me.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But some
can not believe from the start that salvation has been given to the world by
the Cross. Establish by the history of the Greeks that this was possible. Thus
the Apostle himself occasionally persuades unbelievers, and does not retreat
before poets' verses to destroy the fables of poets. If we remember, in fact,
that legions and great nations have often been delivered by the sacrifice and
death of some, as Greek history asserts; if we remember that the daughter of a
chief was sacrificed to pass the armies of the Greeks; if we consider, in
ourselves, that the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sanctify
by its sprinkling to purify their flesh, as it is written to the Hebrews (IX,
13); if the plague, attracted to certain provinces by such sins of men, has
been conjured, it is said, by the death of a single one: all this, having
prevailed by reasoning or result of an arrangement, for one to believe more
easily to the cross of Christ, will create a slope such that not being able to
deny their history, they will acquiesce to ours. But as none of the men was big
enough to take away the sins of the whole world - neither Enoch, nor Abraham,
nor Isaac, who, though offering himself to death, was spared because he did not
could erase all sins: and what man was so great as to expel all sins from him?
Henceforth it is not one of the people, some one in the rank, but the Son of
God, who has been chosen by God the Father; being above all, He could offer
himself for all; He was to die, so that being stronger than death He would
deliver others, become among the dead free without help (Ps. 87, 5), free from
death without help from man or any creature, and truly free, since He rejected
slavery of lusts, ignored the bonds of death.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

I say to you truly, there are some of you here who will not taste death until
you have seen the Kingdom of God. While elevating to rewards for virtues and
teaching that it is useful to despise the things of the earth, the Lord still
upholds the weakness of the human spirit with restitution in the present. It is
certainly difficult to carry the cross and to ex pose one's soul to the
dangers, one's body to death, to give up what you are, when you wish to be what
you are not; and it is rare that even eminent virtue exchanges the present for
the future. Yes, it seems difficult for men to buy hope through perils, and to
acquire at the price of present goods the profit of a time to come. So the good
and humane Master so that no one is broken by despair or lassitude (for the
amiable charms of life soften even a constant heart), promises to his faithful
a life that will be endlessly prolonged. In fact, consolations are frozen under
the fear of death; and a great love of life can scarcely find in the caresses
of hope a compensation for his terror for the threatened salvation. Thus you
have no reason to complain, nor to excuse yourself: the Master of all things
has given virtue his reward, and weakness a remedy; he supports weakness with
present goods, virtue with future goods. If you are brave, despise death; if
you are weak, run away. But no one can flee death unless he follows life; your
life is Christ; it is life that can not die. If, therefore, we do not want to
fear death, let us keep in mind where Christ is, so that we too may say,
"Verily there are among them present who will not taste death. It is not
enough to be present if one is not present where Christ is; for the only ones
who can not taste death are those who can stand with Christ. Whence the very
choice of the expression allows us to conclude that there will not be the
slightest sensation of death for those who have obviously come to the society
of Christ. No doubt, body death will be touched, tasted; the life of the soul
will remain saved. But what is taste of death? Could life be a bread, and death
would be a bread? for there are those who eat "a bread of pain" (Ps
126: 2); there are also the peoples of Ethiopia who received the dragon for
food (Ps 73, 14). God forbid us to devour the venom of the dragon! for we have
the true bread, that bread that came down from heaven (Jn, VI, 51). We eat this
bread when we observe what is written.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">There are
some who will not taste death before seeing the Kingdom of God. There are also
those who will not see death, as it is written, "Who shall live, and shall
not see death" (Ps 88, 49)? But who is the man who will not die, since the
resurrection can take place only for a dead person? It is true that concerning
Enoch and Elijah we have not heard of bodily death, and that the Lord said of
John the Evangelist, "I want him to remain so until my coming (Jn, XXI,
22). But as at this moment we do not think that it is a question of the only
Jean, but of a general warning for a large number, it is not the death of the
body, but that of the soul, which is excluded here . There are dead who live,
as there are some who live by death, for example, who "alive is dead"
(I Tim., V, 6), as it is written, "Let death be upon them, and let them go
down to hell "(Ps 54, 16). So if we go down to hell? because by sin we
descend to hell, the abode of death? There is no doubt for whom the state of
life has not been interrupted even by the death of the body: such as Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, whom we know to be alive by the authority of the divine word;
for if there is a God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, "God is not God
of the dead, but of the living" (Matt. xxii. 32). He does not speak of
one, but of many: for Peter is not dead, since, according to the word of the
Lord, the door of hell could not triumph over him; James and John, the Sons of
Thunder, are not dead either, since having been admitted to the experience of
heavenly glory, the things of the earth do not prevail over them, but are at
their feet. So be you also Peter, devoted, faithful, peaceful, to open the
doors of the Church, to escape the gates of death. Be son of Thunder. You will
tell me: How can I be son of Thunder? You can be, if you rest not on earth, but
on the bosom of Christ; you may be sons of Thunder, if the things of the earth
do not stir you up, but if you yourself shake the things of the earth by the
force of your soul; let the earth tremble before you, do not hold back; that
the flesh fear the power of your soul, be cut down and tamed. You will be sons
of Thunder if you are sons of the Church; that from the gibbet of the Cross
Christ also tells you: "Behold your mother"; let him also say to the
Church, "Behold your son"; it is then that you will begin to be sons
of the Church when you see Christ triumphant on the Cross. For whoever sees a
scandal in the Cross is Jewish, he is not a son of the Church; he who sees in
the Cross a folly is Greek (see I Cor., I 23); but the son of the Church is the
one who sees in the Cross a triumph, which recognizes the voice of Christ
triumphant. So to let you know that Peter, John and James did not taste death,
they got to see the glory of the resurrection: for these are the only three
that, about eight days after these words, He took with Him and driven on the
mountain.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

sense does he say: "Eight days after these words? Is it not that whoever
hears and believes the words of Christ will see the glory of Christ at the time
of the resurrection? For it is the eighth day that the resurrection took place,
and that is why many psalms are entitled: for the octave. Or perhaps, having
said that to sacrifice one's life for the word of God is to save it, he wanted
to show that he would fulfill his promises to the resurrection. But Matthew and
Mark mention that they were taken away six days later. We could say: after six
thousand years, for a thousand years are in the sight of God as one day (Ps 89,
4); but we count more than six thousand years, and we prefer to hear these six
days as a symbol: all the work of the world having been created in six days,
mean by time the work, by the work the world; so is the resurrection, which
will take place when the duration of the world is fulfilled. Or the one who has
risen above the world and has passed the moments of this century will wait, as
established on the heights, the eternal fruit of the resurrection to come. Let
us go beyond the works of the world so that we can contemplate God face to
face. "Climb the mountain, you who give the good news to Zion" (Is.,
XL, 9). If one climbs the mountain to give the good news to Zion, how much more
to proclaim Christ, and Christ gloriously risen! Perhaps indeed many see him in
his body; for we are many who "knew Christ after the flesh, but do not
know him now" (II Cor., V, 16). We are very much acquainted with him,
because many have seen him - "we have seen him, and he had neither beauty
nor brightness" (Is., LII, 2) - but only three, and three chosen, are
driven on the mountain. I believe that in these three the human race is
mysteriously collected - since Noah's three sons descended the whole human race
- if I did not see that they were chosen. Or perhaps alone among all will
deserve to bring to the benefit of the resurrection those who have confessed
Christ; for "the wicked do not rise again for judgment" (Ps 1: 5),
but are punished by virtue of a judgment rendered.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So three
are chosen to climb the mountain, just as two are chosen to be seen with the
Lord: on both sides, consecrated number? perhaps for this reason that no one
can see the glory of the resurrection unless he has kept all the mystery of the
Trinity of an incorruptible, sincere faith. Peter ascends, who has received the
keys of the kingdom of heaven; John, to whom is entrusted the Mother; James,
who first took his place on the priestly throne (1). Then appear Moses and
Elijah, that is to say, the Law and the prophecy, with the Word: for the Law
can not exist without the Word, and one is prophet only if one prophesies the
Son of God. And doubtless the Sons of Thunder have contemplated Moses and
Elijah in their bodily splendor; but we also, every day, see Moses with the Son
of God, because we see the Law in the Gospel when we read, "You will love
the Lord your God"; we see Elijah with the Word of God when we read,
"Behold, a virgin will conceive in her bosom" (Is., vii., 14) 2. So
Luke added that they were talking about his death that he was to realize in
Jerusalem: for the mysteries teach you his death. Even today Moses teaches;
even today Elijah speaks; even today we can see Moses in greater brilliance.
Who could not, when the very people of the Jews could see it, much better saw
it? He saw the glorified face of Moses; but he took a veil, but he did not
climb the mountain, and as a result he went astray. Seeing only Moses, he could
not see at the same time the Word of God. Let us discover our face, so that
"contemplating with openly the glory of God, we are reformed to this same
image" (II Cor., III, 18). Let us climb the mountain, implore the Word of
God, that it may appear to us in its splendor and beauty, that it "be
strong, advance majestically and reign" (Ps. 44, 3ffq). All this is
mysterious and has a deeper meaning: because according to your capacity the
Word diminishes or grows for you; and if you do not climb the summit of a higher
prudence, Wisdom does not appear to you, the knowledge of mysteries does not
appear to you, it does not appear to you what splendor, what beauty there is in
the Word of God ; but the Word of God appears to you as in a body, having
neither its beauty nor its brightness (Is., LII, 2 ssq.); He appears as a man
all bruised, being able to suffer our infirmities; It appears to you as a word
born of man, wrapped in the garment of the letter, not resplendent with the
vigor of the Spirit. But if, in considering man, you believe him begotten of a
Virgin, so little faith tells you that he is born of the Spirit, you begin to
climb the mountain. If, when he is on the cross, you see him triumphing over
death and not annihilated, if you see that the earth has trembled, the sun has
shirked, darkness has invaded unbelievers' eyes, tombs have opened the dead are
risen, to presage that the people of the Gentiles, dead to God, are, so to
speak, the gaping tombs of his body, risen, bathed in the light of the Cross;
if you see this mystery, you have climbed the high mountain, you contemplate
another glory of the Word. His clothes are other down, others up there. And
perhaps the garments of the Word are the discourses of the Scriptures,
dressing, so to speak, the divine thought: for just as it appeared to Peter,
John and James in another aspect, and his garment shone with whiteness In the
same way, in the eyes of your mind, the meaning of the divine Scriptures is
already being clarified. The words of God therefore become like snow, the garments
of the Word extremely white, such as no fuller on earth can do (Mc, IX, 2).
Let's look for this fuller, look for this snow. We read that Isaiah went up to
the Farm of Foulon (Is., VII, 3). Who is this fuller, if not the One who wont
wash our faults? So it is He who said, "If your sins are like purple, I
will make them as white as snow" (Is., I, 18). Who is this fuller, if not
He Who, having washed away the bodily defilements, is accustomed to expose to
the divine sun the garments of our spirit, the garments of virtues? I also
heard? to borrow an argument from the opponents to refute them? compare the
eloquence of two sages to snow and bees 3. I found again that David said,
"How sweet are your words to my throat, more than the honeycomb to my mouth"
(Ps 118,103) ! and, further down, "Your word is a torch before my steps,
Lord, and a light on my path" (Ib., 105). The word of God is light, the
word of God is snow, the word of God still prevails over honey and its ray (Ps.
18, 11); for divine lips flow in speeches sweeter than honey, and his limpid
words fall, like snow, into soft formulas. There is really nothing to be
compared with the snow except that Word, sent from heaven to earth, fertilized
the altered fields of our hearts. This is not an arbitrary supposition, but a
deduction from the text of the Scripture, as God himself testifies with these
words: "Let my speech be waited like rain, and let my words go down like
dew, as the rain on the lawn and the snow on the grass "(Deut., XXXII, 2).
May my soul, Lord Jesus, be showered with your rain and green! may it please
you to spread the whiteness of this snow on my earth, that the glebs of my body
in spring may not be exhausted in premature heat, but rather that the seed of
the heavenly word, covered and brooded by the snow, make them fertile! When the
snow falls, the birds of the sky have no place to live, and, richer than usual,
the harvest of wheat is abundant.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

saw this grace; those who were with him also saw her, though they were
overwhelmed by sleep. For the incomprehensible brilliance of divinity crushes
the senses of our body. If the radiance of the sun can not be borne by the
flesh-eyed eyes that face it, how would the corruption of the human limbs
support the glory of God? that is why at the resurrection the body takes on a
purer and more subtle form, free from its thick defects. Perhaps they were
overwhelmed with sleep, in order to see the image of the resurrection after
rest. 4 And when they awoke, they saw his majesty: for one must be awake to see
the glory of Christ. Pierre was delighted: the attractions of this century did
not captivate him; the charm of the resurrection conquered him. "It's good
for us, he says, to be here"? like this other: "To dissolve myself
and to be with Christ is much better" (Phil. I, 23)? and not satisfied
with having praised, excelling not only in feeling but in actual devotion, this
laborious workman promises, in order to build three tents, the service of a
common obedience. And although he did not know what he said, he promised his
work, however: it was not thoughtless ardor, but devotion eager to multiply the
fruits of piety. His ignorance was of his condition; his promise was
dedication. But human nature is not able to build in this corruptible body, in
this mortal body, a tabernacle for God. Either in the soul, in the body, or in
some other place, avoid seeking what is not permitted to know. If Pierre did
not know, how can you know? If he did not know, he who promised, and whose
great soul was ignorant of the limits of the body, how can we know that a
certain torpor of the spirit is imprisoned by the barriers of the flesh? For
the rest, such devotion has pleased God. "And in the course of these words
a cloud came and covered them with his shadow. It is from the divine Spirit
that this shadow comes: it does not obscure the hearts of men, but reveals the
hidden things. It is found in another place, when the angel says, "And the
power of the Most High will make you a shadow" (Lk, I, 35). And his result
is shown when one hears the voice of God saying, "Here is my beloved Son, listen
to him "; in other words, it is not Elijah who is the Son, it is not Moses
who is the Son, but here is the Son, whom you see alone; because they had
withdrawn, as long as the Lord was going to be appointed. You see that the
perfect faith, not only for the beginners, but also for the perfect, and even
for those in heaven, is to know the Son of God (Jn, XVII, 3). But since we have
already said it before, learn that this cloud is not accumulated by the cloudy
humidity of the steaming mountains (Ps. 103, 32), nor dark vapors of the
condensed air, veiling the sky of frightful darkness, but a luminous cloud that
does not temperate us with torrential rains and downpours, but whose dew, sent
by the voice of Almighty God, has permeated the souls of men with faith.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

while there were three, there is only one. We see three at the beginning, one

asks this to his Father, that all of us be one (Jn, XVII, 22). And not only
Moses and Elijah are one in Christ, but we are also the only body of Christ
(Rom., XII, 5). They, then, are as absorbed in the body of Christ, because we
too will be but one in Christ Jesus; or again: the Law and the Prophets come
from the Word; Now what begins with the Word ends in the Word; because
"the end of the Law is Christ, for the justification of every
believer" (Rom., X, 4).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

not seem consistent with the reason to consider as simple and faithful the one
who is rejected from the favor of the Lord when he had promised obedience and
tireless service; but the Lord does not ask for the appearance of services, but
the purity of heart. As He says above (IX, 10): "Whoever has received this
child in my name. In this place the Lord teaches that simplicity must be
unpretentious, charity without envy, devotion without fury; for he advises to
take the mind of the child in an adult heart, since the child, attributing
nothing to himself, makes himself conformable to virtue, and, if he does not
know the reason, does not know the fault . However, since many consider not as
virtue, but as infirmity simplicity without reason, you are warned to take the
one that is true, that is to say to conquer by your application this gift of
nature. This is why He says, "Whoever receives this child in my name,
receives me; and to receive me is to receive Him who sent me. Indeed, who
receives the imitator of Christ receives Christ, and who receives the image of
God receives God. But since we could not see the image of God, the Incarnation

That's right, Lord; for even Joseph and Nicodemus, disciples who were hiding
for fear, did not refuse you their services when the time came. However, as you
have said elsewhere: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and who does
not harvest with me, dispels" (Lk, XI, 23), explain this to us, so that
has no appearance of contradiction. I think that, if we consider the One who
probes the spirits, we must not doubt that the act of each is distinguished
according to his spirit; as well He said to one, "Follow me," to the
other: "The foxes have their burrows. One is attracted, the other is
dismissed; you learn that dedication is welcomed, lack of dedication excluded.
That if he reproached the disciples for wanting to bring down fire on those who
had not received Christ, it shows us that we must not always chastise those who
have sinned; for sometimes clemency is more advantageous to you as to patience,
to the culprit to raise it up. Moreover, the Samaritans were quick to believe,
they of whom in this place the fire is removed. At the same time, learn that He
did not want to be received by those whom He knew could not be converted from a
simple soul: if He had wanted to, He would have made these non-devoted
devotees. Why did they not welcome him, even the Evangelist mentioned when he
said, "Because he had the appearance of one who goes to Jerusalem. For the
disciples, they wanted to be welcomed in Samaria; but God calls whom He pleases
and makes religious who He wills 7. The disciples are not at fault; they stick
to the law; they knew that Phinehas was reputed to have just killed the
sacrileges (Num., XXV, 7ff, PS.105, 30ffq), and that at Elijah's prayer the

vengeance is good for the one who fears; he who is not afraid does not seek
revenge. It also shows us that the Apostles had the privileges of the prophets,
since they count, as an acquired thing, on the same power that the great
Prophet had deserved. And they have reason to reckon that at their word fire
will come down from heaven, since they are the Sons of Thunder. But the Lord admirably
does all things: He does not welcome him who offers himself presumptuously, and
He is not moved against those who, without consideration, dismiss their own
Master; He wants to show that perfect virtue has no taste for vengeance, that
there is no anger in which there is fullness of charity, and that weakness must
not be rejected, but help. Far from religious souls anger, far from great souls
the avidity of revenge, far from the wise too inconsiderate friendship and
imprudent simplicity. So it says to him, "Foxes have burrows"; and
his services are not accepted because his zeal is not good. The hospitality of
the faith must be circumspect, lest by opening the intimacy of our dwelling to
the infidels, we should fall, by an improvident credulity, into the nets of the
bad faith of others. 2But we do not seem to have left this question aside, so
why does he declare here that we must not oppose those who can, by the laying
on of hands, command unclean spirits in the name of Jesus whereas in Matthew He
said to them, "I do not know you, remove you all from me, workers of
iniquity" (Matt. VII, 23)? We must remark that thought is not different
nor discordant words; but the doctrine is that in a cleric are required not
only the ministries, but the acts of virtue, and that the name of Christ is
such that it will be of little help to defend the saints, even if it serves
them exercise a gift. Thus no one should boast or attribute to himself the
blessing of having purified a man, since he is the power of an eternal name
which has operated, not any capacity of human weakness: the demon He is not
defeated by your merit, but by the hatred of which he is the object. What man
can do is show sincere faith and religiously keep the observance of the
commandments, so that he is not told: The foxes have burrows. For this
deceitful animal, always occupied with ambushes, exercises treachery by
trickery; he does not suffer that nothing is safe, nothing tranquil, nothing
assured, since it is in the very homes of men that he comes to seek his prey.
Now it is to the heretics that he compares the foxes: as well, while he calls
the Gentiles, He excludes the heretics. Because the fox is an animal full of
cunning, digging its burrow and eager to be always lurking in its burrow. Such
are the heretics: they do not know how to build a home, but try to deceive
others by circumventing them. Jacob lives in a house (see Gen. xxv. the heretic
is at the burrow; Like an astute fox, he incessantly prepares ambushes for the
hen of the Gospel, the one of which it is written: "How many times have I
wanted to gather your children, like the hen made of her chicks, and you did
not want to! Behold, your house is going to be abandoned "(Matt., XXIII,
27ff.). So it's just that they have burrows, having lost the house they had.
This animal never tames, so the Apostle says: "After a warning, avoid the
heretic" (Tit., III, 10); it is of no use, and can not serve as food, for
it is not from him that Christ said: "My food is to do the will of my
Father who is in heaven" ( Jn, IV, 34). Much better, He banishes them from
his crops: "Take us, he says, the foxes that ravage the vines"
(Cant., II, 15): that is to say, which can ravage the little vine, no the big
one. And if Samson tied torches in their tails and dropped them in the harvest
of the Philistines (Jug., XV, 4), it is because the heretics seek to burn the
crops of others. They have sound barking rather than chastised language? for
whoever denies the Word can not have a language? ; they are for the moment
undone, but when the end comes they will be bound, and the torches of their
tails announce their final fire. In the same way, the birds of the sky, which
are often interpreted as the figure of evil spirits, build their nests, so to
speak, in the hearts of perverts; so the Son of Man, in this overflow of
iniquity, has no place to rest his head: since the reign of deceit leaves no
room for simplicity, the divinity can not have a domain in the heart belongs to
nobody. The head of Christ is God (I Cor., XI, 3); and when He recognizes the
innocence of a soul, He restores, so to speak, the action of His majesty, which
seems to indicate that a more abundant grace is spreading to the heart of the
good.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">So, to
point out to you that God does not disdain homage, but fraud, having dismissed
the deceiver he chooses the innocent: "Follow me," he said. But he
said it to the one he knew the father was already dead? This father, no doubt,
of whom it was said to someone, "Forget the house of your father"
(Ps.44, 11). See how the Lord calls those whose mercy He has, even if they are
not careful; To him who asked leave to bury his father, he replied: "Let
the dead bury their dead; for you, go announce the Kingdom of God. ".
Since we know that burying is a work of religion, how is it forbidden for him
to bury even his father? Is it not to make you understand that the human passes
after the divine? This care is good, but the inconvenience prevails; to share
one's care is to distract one's affection; to divide his worries is to retard
his progress. We must therefore go first to the principal: for the Apostles, in
order not to hinder the work of preaching, established ministers for the poor;
and they, when the Lord sent them, received the order to salute no one on the
way: not that the regards of benevolence displeased them, but because the
application to continue their service pleased more.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> But
how can the dead bury the dead? Must we not here hear a double death, one of
nature, the other of sin? There is even a third death, by which we die to sin
and live for God, as Christ, who died to sin: "For by dying to sin He died
to sin once for all, living He lives for God (Rom., VI, 10) 1. There is
therefore a death by which the union of the body and the soul is dissolved: we
must not fear it, not fear it, since it has for us the appearance of a
departure, not of a punishment; it is not frightening for the strong, it is
desirable for the wise, desirable for the unfortunate, and from it it has been
said: "Men will seek death and will not find it" (Rev. IX, 6). ).
There is another, which puts an end to the voluptuousness of the world, where
it is not nature that dies, but faults. This death, we suffer, when at baptism
we are buried and died with Christ (Rom., VI, 4, Col., II, 12) to the elements
of this world, when we experience the forgetting of our primary activity . It
was from this death that Balaam wanted to die in order to live for God, when he
prophesied: "Let my soul die among the souls of the righteous, and let my
offspring be like their offspring" (Num., XXIII, 10) 8! . There is still a
third death, where we ignore Christ who is our life; to know Christ, on the
contrary, is eternal life (cf Jn., XVII, 3), which is now within the reach of
the just under the shadows, but in the future will be face to face; for the
spirit before our face is the Lord Christ, of whom it has been said, "We
shall live under his shadow among the nations" (Lam. IV, 20). In the
shadow of his wings David has hoped (Ps. 56, 2); the Church desired her shadow
and sat down there (Cant., II, 3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If your
shadow, Lord Jesus, is so profitable, that will give us your reality! As we
live, when we are no longer in the shadows, but in life itself! For now
"our life is hidden with Christ in God; but when Christ appears, our life,
then, it is said, we too will appear with Him in glory "(Col., III, 3ffq).
Kind is that life, which does not know death; for this bodily life knows death
by natural destiny, and often it is desired. Often the soul itself knows death
by the defilement of sin - for "the sinful soul will die" (Ez.,
XVIII, 4); but when, strengthened and strengthened by bliss, she will begin to
be no longer subject to sin, she will not be mortal, but will reap eternal
life. Let us hasten, then, my brothers, to this life, sad in this age, because
exiled from God (II Cor., V, 6) - for whoever is not exiled from his body is
exiled from God; but it is far better to be separated from one's body and to
adhere to God (Phil., II, 23) -to be one of us, too, in Almighty God and to see
the only Son of God, introduced by the glory of the resurrection in its state
of clarity, and, in an inviolable concord of souls, in an endless alliance,
imitating the unity of lasting peace: thus will be accomplished what the Son of
God has promised for us in his pray to his Father: "That they also may be
one, as we are one" (Jn, XVII, 21). He does not forbid crying and burying
a father, but he passes religious piety to God before family ties: one thing is
left to those who have the same fate, the other recommended to the elect. Or -
since the throat of the ungodly is a gaping sepulcher (Ps. 5, 10) - it is
prescribed to erase the memory of those whose value succumbs with their bodies;
and the son is not diverted from honoring his father, but the believer is
separated from the unbeliever's communion. For the righteous have, as it were,
a burial of their own, like the one of which it is said: "In pouring out
this perfume on my body, it did it for my burial" (Matt. XXVI, 12). Therefore
whoever, by a true faith, buries Christ in him to raise with him, must not bury
in him the bad faith of the devil. There is also, in the prophetic sense, the
burial which consists in depositing on the tombs of our elders what you know,
reader, what the infidel must not understand; it is not a question of
prescribing food or drink, but of revealing the venerable participation in the
sacred offering. 9 It is therefore not a matter of banning a present, but it is
a religious mystery that we we will not have fellowship with the dead pagans;
for if the sacraments are not for the dead, those are not dead who have life.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

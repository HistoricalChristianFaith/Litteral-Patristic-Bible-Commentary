clemency of the Lord Savior. He is not moved with indignation, nor offended by
crime, nor affected by injustice to the point of abandoning Judea; on the
contrary, forgetting wrongs, thinking only of clemency, sometimes teaching,
sometimes delivering, sometimes healing, He seeks to soften the heart of this
unfaithful people. And it is good that S. Luke first mentioned the man
delivered from the evil spirit, and then related the healing of a woman: for
the Lord had come to care for one and the other sex; it was necessary to heal first
the one who was created first, and not to leave aside the one who had sinned by
inconstancy of soul more than by perversity. It is a Saturday that the Lord
begins to perform healings, to signify that the new creation begins at the
point where the old had stopped, to mark on the premise that the Son of God is
not subject to the Law. but superior to the Law, that He does not destroy the
Law, but accomplishes it. It is not by the Law but by the Word that the world
has been made, as we read:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"By
the Word of the Lord the heavens have been made firm" (Ps 32,6). The Law
is not destroyed, but fulfilled, in order to renew the once fallen man. So the
Apostle says, "Destroy the old man, put on the new, which was created
according to Christ" (Col., III, 9 ff.). And it is right that he begins on
Saturday, to show that he is the Creator, bringing works into the fabric of
works, continuing the work he had once begun Himself. Like the worker who is
about to repair a house, he begins, not with the foundations but with the
roofs, to demolish the dilapidated one; so he puts his hand first to the point
where he had previously finished. Then it begins with the least to come to the
most considerable. Deliver from the devil, even men can? by the word of God it
is true; ? to command the dead to resurrect only belongs to the power of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Nazareth. It is not from him that Christ received this name: from heaven the
Angel brought it to the Virgin. It is his impudence to pretend to the primeur
of something among men and to present to men a so-called novelty, to inspire
the terror of his power. As well, in Genesis, is he the first to speak of God
to man; for you read, "And he said to the woman, Why then hath God told
you not to eat of any tree?" (Gen., III, 1)? So one and the other was
deceived by the devil, healed by Christ. Continue, continue, learn the
mysteries of the Gospel text, and in these two healings recognize the mystery of
common salvation. "In the same way, that all die in Adam, so all are
quickened in Christ" (I Cor. XV, 22).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Who is the
one who in the synagogue was possessed of an unclean spirit? Is it not the
Jewish people? As entwined by the rings of a serpent and caught in the nets of
the devil, he defiled his pretended body purity by the inner garbage of the
soul. And it is very true that there was in the synagogue a man possessed of
the foul spirit, because he had lost the Holy Spirit. The devil had entered the
place from which Christ had gone out. At the same time, we are shown that the
nature of the devil is not evil, that his works are iniquitous: for he who, by
virtue of his superior nature, recognizes him as Lord, by his works he denies
him. And what shows its malice and the depravity of the Jews is that it has
spread over this people such blindness, such infirmity of spirit, that this
people denies the one that the demons recognize. O disciples and heirs worse
than their master! He tempts the Lord in words, them by the fact; He said,
"Throw yourself," they begin to rush him. To weigh these things from
a deeper point of view, we must hear the health of the soul and the body: first
the soul, prey to the pitfalls of the serpent, is delivered; for the soul would
never be vanquished by the body, if at first it was not tempted by the devil.
From the moment, in fact, that the soul moves, vivifies, and leads the body,
how could it allow itself to be caught by its bait, if it were not itself
entwined by the bonds of some higher power? So Eve did not feel hunger until
tempted by the cunning of the serpent; and that is why the salutary remedy must
first act against the author of sin itself. Perhaps, too, represented by this
woman, mother-in-law of Simon and Andrew, was it our flesh that suffered divers
fevers of sins and burned excessive transports of various lusts. The fever of
love is not less, I would say, than that which warms. This fever burns the
soul, the other the body. For our fever is debauchery; lusts are hot; so the Apostle
says, "Let those who can not restrain themselves marry; it is better to
marry than to burn "(7 Cor., VII, 9). Our fever is luxury; our fever is
anger. Although they are vices of the flesh, they make their fire penetrate the
bones, they affect the mind, the soul and the senses. The soul is the first
solicited by the artifice of the devil: for a fertile field, a garment, a
jewel, all this is persuasion of the serpent. The attraction of honors, the
summit of power, the delights of feasts, the beauty of a courtesan, is the trap
of the devil; they are like the seductive remarks of the perverse mind, which,
by the seduction of the flesh, soon brings down an almost feminine lightness,
also precipitates and degrades the soul, because the beauty of a woman is not
coveted. first of all by the soul, but by the eyes of the body: what you do not
see, you do not like it; but as soon as the flesh has coveted, the soul becomes
enthralled with it, and sees its constancy fade, the spirit sharing this love
falters (they are two in the same body) (Gen., II, 24), and thus death
penetrates by the accomplished crime. The devil tempts, the flesh persuades.
Yet the fever of the soul is more violent than that of the body; It often
happens that the pleasure of the soul causes the health of the body to be
despised and not to avoid dangers. It is not out of place to recall the story
of Theotime here. He was suffering from a serious eye disease, he loved his
wife, the doctor had forbidden him the use of marriage. In the impatience of
desire, carried away by the ardor of passion, he could not moderate himself.
Knowing for sure that he would lose his sight, before approaching his wife, in
the very fire of his burning desire, everything being ready for this business,
"Farewell," he said, dear light. Like what passion is more ardent
than fever, cut down and consume more! But as soon as one returns from his
madness, the intimate conscience opens his eyes, then comes the repentance of
the act and everyone blushes with the infamy of his crime. Then God is afraid,
and the sinner would like to repent, but he can not; then we attack the flesh,
we accuse the devil: she as a middleman of vices, he as the artisan of
misguidance. The ugliness spreads out: for every secret is bare before God, and
it is not the leaves of the fig tree, that is to say, the garment of the body
or the worldly morgue which veil the secret vices. And everyone, the conscious
soul of his fault, trembles at the judgment of God and says "If the
mountains could fall on me! in what cracks in the rocks will I hide when He
comes to crush the earth? Then the flesh gives birth to the thorns and thorns,
that is to say, the quills of worries and preoccupations, and the fires of
which the soul is enveloped by the lust of the flesh. Yes, the soul is
crucified by the nails of the pleasures of the body, and once given to earthly
lusts where it plunges, it is difficult for it unless it is a divine favor, to
resume its flight to the heights of where She went down. Enlaced by the nets of
her actions, delivered to the charms of worldly pleasures, she is now captive.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So is the
Adam, like the Eve whom the Lord came to release: one was made in the image of
God, the other received his strength from his husband and, as long as it was
subjected to stronger that they had in one mind only a will, pleasing to God;
and, placed in the paradise of God, they took care of feeding their heavenly
life. But once the flesh began to give different advice and to no longer
observe its own law, they were exiled from paradise and deserved to fall back
into the abyss and abyss of this place of sin. And that no one judges it wrong
to regard Adam and Eve as figures of the soul and the body while they are
considered to represent the Church and Christ - for the Apostle, having said
that they are two in one flesh, added, "This is a great mystery, I mean as
to Christ and the Church" (Eph., V, 32) - so then there may be the mystery
of the sovereign God at strong reason that of our soul. But she is tied up,
nailed, captive, and consumed with the fevers of the body, suffering with the
flesh, she is sick. You have to look for a doctor. But who will be strong
enough to heal the wounds of the wounded soul? What man will be able to help
others when he can not help himself? Who can restore life to others when he can
not escape death himself? All died in Adam, for "sin has entered into this
world through one man, and through sin death; and it has passed to all men,
from the moment that all have sinned "(Rom., V, 12). So the fault of that
one is the death of all. As well, saints were sent, prophets were sent to
proclaim divine oracles; and they could not move anything forward. So let's
look for some doctor among angels or archangels. But how could they help me so
that I do not sin, since even an archangel could not abstain from sinning? How
can an angel bring me back to paradise, when Satan himself and his angels could
not keep the place they had received?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

going up into a boat which was at Simon, he begged him to depart a little from
the shore. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">From the
moment that the Lord accorded many cures of various kinds, neither time nor
place could contain the eagerness of the crowd to be healed. In the evening,
they followed him; the lake was there, they pressed him. That is why He goes up
in Peter's boat. This is the boat that we see in St. Matthew still agitated
(Matth., VIII, 24), in S. Luke filled with poests: you will thus recognize and
the troubled beginnings of the Church and, later, its fertility ; because fish
represent those who move in life. There Christ still sleeps among the
disciples, here He commands: He sleeps in the shakers, He is awake among the
perfect. But in what way does Christ sleep, you have heard him say by the
Prophet, "I sleep, and my heart watches" (Cant., V, 2). And St. Matthew
did well not to omit the manifestation of eternal power when He commands the
winds. This is not human science? as you hear it say to the Jews: "Of a
word II commands to the spirits"? but a mark of celestial majesty when the
agitated sea subsides, when the elements obey the order of the divine voice,
when insensible objects acquire the sense of obedience. The mystery of divine
grace is revealed when the waves of the world subside, when a word makes the
unclean mind cling to it; one does not contradict the other: the two things are
highlighted. You have a miracle in the elements, you have a teaching in the
mysteries. St. Matthew having thus taken his part, S. Luc has adjudged the boat
where Pierre had to fish. The one who has Peter is not agitated; The one who
has Judas is agitated: undoubtedly the many merits of the disciples were
embarked on it, but she was still agitated by the perfidy of the traitor. In
both there was Peter: but, solid in his merits, he is agitated by those of
others. Let us beware of the treacherous, let us beware of the traitor, lest
one put us all in danger. So no agitation for the boat where prudence leads,
from which is absent the perfidy, that pushes the faith. How could she be
agitated, having for pilot the one on whom the Church is founded? There is
therefore agitation when faith is weak; security when the charity is perfect.
So, if we command others to throw their nets, we say only to Peter: "Leads
off", that is to say in the high seas of controversy. Is there depth
comparable to the sight of deep riches (Rom., XI, 33), to the knowledge of the
Son of God, to the proclamation of his divine generation? This, the human mind
certainly can not grasp it and fully probe by reason; but the fullness of faith
reaches him. For if I am not allowed to know how He was born, I am not allowed
to ignore that He was born; I do not know the mode of his generation, but I
recognize the principle of his generation. We were not there when the Son of
God was born of the Father; but we were there when the Father declared him Son
of God. If we do not believe God, who to believe? All that we believe, we
believe as seen or heard: the sight is often wrong, the hearing is authentic.
Do you reject the personality of the witness? If good people spoke to us, we would
consider it a criminal offense not to believe them: God asserts, the Son shows,
the sun eclipses, the earth testifies with trembling. The Church is led by
Peter off controversies, to see on the one hand the risen Son of God, on the
other the spread of the Holy Spirit.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

what are the nets of the Apostles, which are ordered to cast? Is it not the
sequence of words, the folds of discourse, the depths of discussions, which do
not let those who have taken them escape? And it is good that the fishing instruments
of the Apostles are the nets, which do not destroy their catch, but keep it and
remove it from the abyss to the light, which carry those who floated from the
lowlands on the heights.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> He
is still for the Apostles a fishery of another kind; this kind of fishing, the
Lord only orders it to Peter alone: ​​"Throw the hook," said he,
"and take the first fish that will go up again" (Matt. XVII, 26).
Great and spiritual lesson, which teaches Christians submission to the
sovereign power, so that no one will allow himself to break the edicts of a
king of the earth. If the Son of God has paid tribute, are you tall enough,
you, to feel that you have not to pay it? Even He, who possessed nothing, paid
tribute; and you, who seek the profits of this world, why not recognize the
burdens of this world? why judge you above the world, in the arrogance of your
soul, when you are subject to the world by your miserable cupidity? Thus the
didrachm is paid: it was the price of our redemption and of our body, promised
in the Law (II Kings, XII, 4), paid in the Gospel and found not without reason
in the mouth of a fish: for "it is by your mouth that you will be
justified" (Matt. xii. 37). The price of immortality for us is our
testimony; for, as it is written, "The mouth testifies for salvation"
(Rom., X, 10). Perhaps this first fish is the first martyr: it has in its mouth
the didrachm, that is to say, the amount of the tax; our didrachm is Christ. So
the first martyr, who is Stephen, had this treasure in his mouth when he spoke
of Christ in his passion (Act., VII, 55 ff.).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> But
let us return to the text that we have discussed, and learn the humility of the
Apostle. "Master," said he, "we have toiled all night without
taking anything; but on your word I will throw the net. I too, Lord, know that
for me it is night when you do not order. No one has signed up yet, it's still
night for me. I laid the trap of speech at Epiphany, and I have not taken
anything yet. I asked it during the day; I am waiting for your order; on your
word I will throw the nets. O vain presumption! O fruitful humility! they had
taken nothing until then; at the voice of the Lord they capture a great
multitude of fish. It is not the work of human eloquence but the benefit of the
heavenly call. Truce to human arguments: it is by his faith that the people
believe. The nets break and the fish does not escape. We call to the rescue the
companions who were in the other boat. What is this boat? perhaps Judea, in
which John and James were chosen? for "Judea became her sanctuary"
(Ps 113: 2). These, therefore, come from the synagogue to Peter's boat, that is
to say, to the Church, in order to fill the two nacelles. For all bend the knee
in the name of Jesus (Philip II, 10), either the Jew or the Greek: "Christ
is all, and in all" (Col. III, 11). But for me, I dread this piling up,
and so filled the boats are not about to sink: for there must be heresies (I
Cor., XI, 19), for the test of the good. We can, however, recognize yet another
church in the boat of another; because of the unique Church several are born.
This is one more worry for Pierre, that his taking already preoccupied. But
being perfect he knows how to keep those he has gathered, since he knows how to
take those who are scattered; those he takes on a word, he gives them to the
Word; it is not, he says, his capture, it is not his doing. "Depart from
me, Lord," he said; because I am a sinful man. He was surprised at divine
gifts, and the more he had obtained, the less he flattered himself. Say, you too:
"Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinner," so that the Lord may
answer you: "Do not be afraid. To the forgiving Lord confess your sin. Do
not be afraid to tell the Lord even what is yours, since he has given us what
is his. "He does not know how to envy, He does not know how to delight, He
does not know how to remove, See how good the Lord is to have given men the
power to give life.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

as He was in a city, behold, a leprous man prostrating himself on the ground
implored him, saying, Lord, if you wish, you may cleanse, and He stretched out
his hand and touched him. saying, I want it, be cleansed. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is good
that for this cure of the leper one does not expressly designate any locality,
to show that it is not the only people of a special city, but the peoples of
the universe who have been healed. It is also good that, in St. Luke, this
healing is the fourth prodigy since the arrival of the Lord at Capernaum; for
if on the fourth day he gave the light of the sun and made it brighter than the
other days, when the elements of the world appeared, we must also consider this
work as more brilliant. According to Matthew, it is presented to us as the
first healed by the Lord after the Beatitudes (Matt., VIII, 3): thus, the Lord
having said: "I did not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it"
(Matt, V, 17), this man who was excluded by the Law, if he intended to be
purified by the power of the Lord, judged that grace does not come from the Law
but is above the Law, since it can erase the stain of a leper. But just as in
the Lord power and authority, so appears in this man the constancy of faith. He
prostrates himself face down, which is humility and confusion, so that everyone
blushes with the defilements of his life. But restraint did not stifle the
confession: he showed his wound, he asked for the remedy, and his confession is
full of religion and faith: "If you want it," he said, "you can
cleanse me . At the will of the Lord he attributes power; as to the will of the
Lord, he doubted it for lack of believing in his goodness, but, conscious of
his defilement, he did not discount it. And the Lord, with this customary
dignity, answers him: "I want it, be purified. ". "And
immediately his leprosy left him. For there is no interval between the work of
God and his order: the order itself includes the work. As well "He said,
and it was done" (Ps 32, 9). As you can see, there is no doubt that for
God's will, it is power. If, therefore, in Him will is power, those who affirm
the unity of will in the Trinity certainly affirm the unity of power. Thus
leprosy immediately withdrew: recognize the will to heal, which has followed
the action of the realization. So, according to Mark, the Lord had mercy on
him: it is good that it should be noted. Many similar traits have been noted by
the evangelists, who wanted to strengthen us on two points: they described the
marks of power for the sake of faith; they mentioned virtuous works for
imitation. That is why He touches him without disgust; He commands without
hesitation: for it is a mark of his power that, having the power to heal and
the authority to ordain, He has not disdained the testimony of his activity. So
He says, "I want," because of Photin; He orders, because of Arius; He
touches because of the Manichean.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And there
is not only one whose leprosy is healed; there are all those to whom it is
said: "You are now pure, thanks to the word that I have spoken to
you" (Jn, XV, 3). If, therefore, the remedy of leprosy is speech, the
scorn of speech is assuredly the leprosy of the soul. But so that leprosy does
not pass to the doctor, each one, taking model on the humility of the Lord,
must avoid gloriole. Why, in fact, recommend not to tell anyone about it,
except to teach us not to divulge our benefits, but to hide them, so as to
exclude wages, not only money, but favor? Perhaps the reason for prescribing
silence is a preference for those who will believe by spontaneous faith rather
than by the hope of benefit. But it is prescribed to him, according to the law,
to present himself to the priest, not to bring a foreign victim, but to offer
himself to God as a spiritual sacrifice, so that the defilement of his past
actions being erased, it is consecrated to God as a pleasant victim through the
knowledge of faith and the education of wisdom; for "every victim shall be
seasoned with salt" (Mk. IX, 48). In this regard Paul says again: "I
beg you, my brothers, by the mercy of God, to offer your bodies as a victim
acceptable and acceptable to God" (Rom., XII, 7).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> This
at the same time is admirable, that he has healed according to the mode of the
request. "If you want, you can cleanse me. - I want it, be purified. You
see here his will, you see also his disposition of tenderness. "And
extending his hand, he touched him. The Law forbids touching lepers (Lev.,
XIII, 3); but he who is the ruler of the law does not follow the law, but does
the law. So he touched, not because he could not heal, but to prove that he was
not subject to the Law and that he did not fear contagion like men, but could
not to be contaminated, He who delivered others, and on the contrary the touch
of the Lord drove leprosy, which usually contaminated anyone who touched. He is
commanded to show himself to the priest and make an offering for his
purification; if he presents himself thus to the priest, the priest will
understand that he has not been healed according to legal procedure, but by the
grace of God superior to the law; then, by prescribing a sacrifice as Moses
commanded, the Lord showed that He did not destroy the Law but did it; He
behaved according to the Law, even though he was seen to heal, by going beyond
the Law, those whom the remedies of the Law had not healed. And he rightly
adds: "as Moses has prescribed"; because "the law is
spiritual" (Rom., VII, 14); so we see that he has prescribed a spiritual
sacrifice. He finally adds: "That this may be a testimony to you",
that is to say, if you believe in God, if the leprosy of impiety withdraws, if
the priest knows what is hidden, if he witness the purity of your feelings,
which would make one see the priest preferably in the One to whom no secret
escapes, to whom it is said: "You are a priest for eternity, according to
the order of Melchizedek" ( Ps. 109, 4).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

higher, so numb that it is by the weakness of the body. It is again through
their ministry that, fashioned to rise and fall, it will be placed before

not expect forgiveness for grave faults, turn to intercessors, turn to the

forgiveness that he may have refused you. And, although we must not neglect the
historical reality and believe that the body of this paralytic has really been
healed, however, recognize the healing of the inner man, to whom his sins are
forgiven. By asserting that only the Lord can deliver them, the Jews
necessarily recognize his divinity and their judgment betrays their bad faith,
since they exalt the work and deny the person. So the Son of God has gathered
their testimony about his work, without asking for their word to be accepted:
for bad faith can admit, it can not believe; therefore the testimony is not
lacking in divinity, faith lacks for salvation. For it is a greater help for
faith than this involuntary testimony; and it is a more disastrous mistake to
deny when one is convinced by one's own affirmations. It is therefore a great
misguidance that this unbelieving people, having recognized that God alone is
to remit sins, do not believe in this God when He remits sins. As for the Lord,
who wants to save sinners, He demonstrates his divinity and his knowledge of
secrets and the wonders of his actions; He adds: "Which is the easiest?
say: your sins are given to you, or say: get up and walk? ". In this place
He shows a complete picture of the resurrection, since, healing the wounds of
soul and body, He remits the sins of souls, he drives out the infirmity of the
body: it means that the whole man is healed. Still, how great it is to give men
their sins - for "who can forgive sins save God alone," who also
remits them by those to whom He has given the power to deliver? Yet it is much
more divine to give resurrection to bodies, since the Lord himself is the
resurrection.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

David, as we read: "I wash my bed every night; from my tears I watered my
bed "(Ps 6: 7). It is the bed of suffering in which our soul lay in prey
to the painful torments of his conscience. But when one behaves according to
the precepts of Christ, it is no longer a bed of suffering, but of rest. The
mercy of the Lord has changed in rest what was dead: it is He who for us has

the mysterious vocation of the publican. He orders him to follow him not with

until then had eagerly drawn his profit from merchandise, with the harshness of
the fatigues and perils of the seamen, on a word of appeal, has left his
property, he who stole the property of others; and, leaving this infamous
bench, he walked after the Lord with all the ardor of his soul. Moreover, he
unfolds the apparatus of a great feast: for he who receives Christ in his
interior dwelling is satiated with the immense delights of superabundant joys.
Yes, the Lord willingly enters and rests in the love of the one who believed.
But here is rekindling the malevolence of the unbelievers, and the image of
their retribution to come is figuratively beforehand. While the faithful will
feast and rest in the kingdom of heaven, unbelief will fast and be tortured. At
the same time there is the difference between the disciples of the Law and of
grace: those who follow the Law will suffer in their fasting soul an eternal
hunger; those who have received the Word in the intimacy of the soul, renewed
by the abundance of food and the eternal fountain, can not be hungry and
thirsty. Therefore those whose fasting souls were murmuring, "Why,"
said they, "does he eat and drink with publicans and sinners? ". This
is the word of the serpent; so was it the first word the serpent uttered when
he said to Eve, "Why did God say, Do not eat every tree? So they spread
the venom of their father, when they say, "Why then does he eat and drink
with the publicans and the sinners? As long as the Lord eats with the
publicans, He does not forbid us to have a meal even with Gentiles: He says:
"It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but those who go wrong.
". It is a new remedy that the new Master has brought; it is not a product
of the earth; every creature ignores the art of making it. Come, all of you who
have contracted various diseases of sins; use this unusual remedy which
eliminates the venom of the snake, which has not only removed the scar from
wounds, but removed the cause of the cruel wound. This remedy does not involve
diet, but provides nourishment for the soul: for "the Son of Man has come,
eating and drinking, and it is said, He is possessed" (Lk 7:34). So our
soul is not hungry; hungry, those whose Christ is absent and who lack the
provisions of good merits. On the contrary, he who possesses the delights of
his virtue, who receives Christ in his house, offers a great feast, that is to
say, the spiritual feast of good works, of which the people of the rich are
deprived, where the poor is satiated. And that is why, says He, the sons of the
Bridegroom can not fast while the Bridegroom is with them. "But there will
come days when the Bridegroom will be delighted. ". What are those days
when Christ will be delighted, especially when He Himself said, "I will be
with you until the end of time" (Matt., XXVIII, 20), that He Himself said,
"I will not leave you orphans" (Jn, XIV, 18)? For it is certain that
if he forsakes us, we can not be saved. Nobody can steal Christ from you if you
do not hide from Him. May your vanity not conceal you, may the presumption not
conceal you. And do not prevail of the Law; because "He did not come to
call the righteous, but the sinners".</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">How, then,
does God love righteousness (Psalm 10: 8) and did not David see the righteous
man left behind (Psalm 36:25)? What is this equity that abandons the righteous
and calls the sinner to himself? Unless he hears those who claim the law to be
righteous and do not seek the grace of the gospel: but no one is justified by
the law, but one is redeemed by grace. Justice is therefore in the law, but
justice is not by the law; for the Apostle himself says, "Hebrew and son
of Hebrews, as to the law, Pharisee, concerning the righteousness of the law,
living without reproach" (Phil., III, 5-6); He who boasted of the Law
said: "These advantages I have considered, with regard to Christ, as a
detriment" (Ib., 7); which means that he rejected the justice and glory of
the Law; for the righteousness of the law without Christ is empty, since the
fullness of the law is Christ. So that justice is in the law, justice is not by
the law; for "if righteousness is by the law, then Christ died without
reason" (Gal. ii. 21), since Christ died to fulfill justice; as well, when
John says to him: "It is I who must be baptized by you, and it is you who
come to me", II replies: "Let it go: that is how it befits us to
accomplish all righteousness "(Matt., III, 14-15). So Christ is not dead
without reason, but for us, so that the righteous may shine like the sun in the
Kingdom of his Father (Matt. XIII, 43). But the Jews are not righteous, and
they are told, "When ye see the righteous enter into the kingdom of
heaven" (Lk 13:28). Those are just who do not give up, who love their
enemy. Failing to hear it thus, we discover a contradiction in "I did not
come to call the just"; but He does not call those who call themselves
righteous, because "ignorant of God, and seeking to establish their own
righteousness, they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God"
(Rom. x. 3). Therefore, those who claim justice are not called to grace: for if
grace comes from repentance, it is clear that to repent repentance is to
renounce grace. They were thirsty as wounded, those who call themselves saints:
to those the Bridegroom will be delighted. But to us neither Caiaphas nor
Pilate has delighted Christ and we can not fast, since we have Christ and are
nourished by the flesh and blood of Christ. How to appear fasting if one is not
hungry? How to appear on an empty stomach if one is not thirsty? And how to be
thirsty when one drinks Christ, since Himself said: "He who drinks of the
water that I will give, will never thirst" (Jn, IV, 13). Besides, it is the
fasting of the soul, it is what shows also the continuation; For he says to
them this parable: No one shall put on an old habit a piece of a new garment.
He had said that the sons of the Bridegroom, that is to say the sons of the
Word, brought up by the regeneration of baptism on the condition of the divine
race, as long as the Bridegroom is with them can not fast. It is certainly not
to proscribe fasting, which weakens the flesh and represses the sensuality of
the body: for this fasting is a recommendation to God. How would the Lord here
forbid fasting to his disciples, while he was fasting Himself, and when finally
He says that the worst minds are accustomed to yield only to fasts and prayers
(Matt., XVII, 20 )? In short, here again, it is fasting that he calls an old
garment: the one that the Apostle judged good to strip, when he said: "Get
rid of the old man with his activities," to put on the one which is
renewed by the sanctification of baptism (Col., III, 9, 10). The sequence of
precepts, therefore, agrees in the same teaching: not to mix the acts of the
old man and the new; for the first, carnal, performs the acts of the flesh; the
other, the interior, the reborn, must not present the variegation of old and
new actions, but, bearing the color of Christ, apply his soul to imitate Him
for whom he has taken a new birth at baptism. Far from us then, these
multicolored veils of the soul, which displease the Bridegroom;</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">He does
not like anyone who does not have the wedding dress. And what can please the
Bridegroom if not the peace of the soul, the purity of the heart, the charity
of the spirit? The good Bridegroom is the Lord Jesus. He inaugurated a life
that comes from a new birth. The one who married her is delivered from the
corruptions of the flesh; she does not look for mortal children? she does not
like herself in Eve's pains? nor a husband subject to sin, nor the inheritance
of a condemned father. She saw the ulcers of this flesh that she previously
desired; she has taken care that it is not true beauty that is disfigured by
vices. So what do you have to do with such a husband, O woman? Look carefully,
and all over this body you will find sores. Recognize rather another
Bridegroom, who is surrounded by light, whose beauty can not perish. This one,
carry it in your soul, consecrate it in your temple; carry it in your body, as
it is written, "Carry the Lord in your body" (I Cor. VI, 20). Enter
into his new bed, contemplate his unaccustomed beauty, clothe him, see him at
the right hand of the Father, and rejoice at having such a Bridegroom; He will
bless you, lest the tears of sin be hurt. Let us preserve the garment of which
the Lord has clothed us on leaving the holy water. This garment is quickly torn
if the actions are not related; he is quickly eaten from the fleshy moths and
defiled the old man's wanderings.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Here,
therefore, we are forbidden to associate the new and the old; in the Apostle,
even to put the old on the old: we must strip the old, put on the new, to find
ourselves stripped, but not naked (II Cor., V, 2-4). We stripped ourselves for
the best; we are laid bare when the garment is taken from us by the trick of
another, instead of being left of our own free will.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
nobody puts new wine in old bottles. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
fragility of human nature is exposed when our bodies are compared to the
remains of dead animals. And please God that we can fulfill the office of good
wineskins: to preserve the mystery we have received. The art of avoiding damage
is to entrust the renewed wine to new wineskins. We must always keep these full
bottles: empty, ringworm and rust gnaw quickly; grace keeps them filled.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> There
is a fine correspondence between this work and such precepts: for it is the
sixth work that this sort of new form gives to the physiognomy of Levi. Now it
is the sixth day that man was created; it is by the sixth work of Christ that
the old creature is reformed, but a new one, and an unusual form. Also, as a
new creature, he offers a feast to Christ, because Christ delights in him and
he himself deserves to have his share of delights with Christ. It is therefore
to form him that Christ gives precepts. He followed him now, happy, cheerful,
transported: "I no longer look like a publican," he said; I no longer
wear Levi; I robbed Levi by putting on Christ. I hate my race, I flee my life
first; I am only you, Lord Jesus, who heal my wounds. Who would separate me
from the love of God, who is in you? the tribulation? anxiety? hunger ? (Rom.,
VIII, 35). I am attached as by the nails of faith, I am restrained by the good
hindrances of love. All your commandments will be like a cautery that I will
keep applied; the cautery of the command burns, but it is the decay of the
flesh that it burns, so that the contagion does not gain the life; the remedy
bites, but it removes the infection from the ulcer. Take away, Lord Jesus, by
your mighty sword the decay of my sins; while you hold me bound by the bonds of
love, trim all that is spoiled. Come quickly to discover hidden, secret and
varied passions; debride the wound, lest the unhealthy mood spreads. Purify any
infection with the new bath. Listen to me, earthly men, whose thoughts are
intoxicated by your sins. I too, Levi, was hurt by such passions; I found a
doctor who lives in heaven and spreads his remedies on earth. He alone can heal
my wounds, for He does not know them; He can take from his heart his pain, his
soul from his pallor, for he knows the secrets."</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

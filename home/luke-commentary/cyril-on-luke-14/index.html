<i>And it came to pass, when He had gone into the house of one of the chief
Pharisees on the sabbath day to eat bread, that they watched Him. And behold
there was a certain man before Him who had the dropsy. And Jesus answered and
spoke unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying; Is it lawful to heal on the
sabbath day or no? And they were silent. And He took him, and healed him, and
sent him away. And He answered them, saying; Which of you shall have a son or
an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out on the sabbath
day? And they could not return Him an answer to these things.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the Lord works miracles, and exercising a divine and supreme power, performs
His accustomed acts, and manifests His glory. He benefits then in more ways
than one the intractable and contentious Pharisee. For just as maladies of more
than usual violence will not yield to the skill of physicians, but require the
main force of persons of blunter feelings: so also the human mind, that has
turned aside to wickedness, rejects all that could benefit it, directly that it
has once become the victim of an uncontrollable tendency to disobedience, being
brought into this state by unreproved departures from the right path. </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_10_sermons_99_109.htm#1" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>1</u></span></sup></a></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that this is undeniably true, any one may see who will give his attention to
the lessons here set before us. For a Pharisee, of higher rank than usual,
invited Jesus to a banquet: and He, although He knew their malice, went with
him, and dined in their company. And He submitted to this act of condescension,
not to honour His inviter, but rather to benefit those in whose company He was,
by such words and miraculous deeds as might lead them to the acknowledgment of
the true service, even that which is taught us by the gospel. For He <a name="p472"><font color="#000000">|472</font></a> know that even against their will He would make them
eyewitnesses both of His power, and of His more than human glory, if perchance
even so they might believe that He is God and the Son of God, Who assumed
indeed our likeness, but continued unchanged, nor ceased to be that which He
had been.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
became the guest then of His inviters, to fulfil, as I said, a necessary duty:
"but they, it says, watched Him." And for what reason did they watch
Him, and on what account? To see forsooth whether He would disregard the honour
due to the law, and so do something or other forbidden on the sabbath day. But,
O senseless Jew, understand that the law was a shadow and type, waiting for the
truth: and the truth was Christ, and His commandments. Why then do you arm the typo
against the truth? why do you set the shadow in array against the spiritual
interpretation? Keep your sabbath rationally: but if you will not consent so to
do, then art you cut off from that sabbath keeping which is well pleasing to
God, and know not the true rest, which He requires of us Who of old spoke the
law of Moses. Let us cease from our sins; let us rest from our offences; let us
wash away our stains; let us abandon the impure love of the flesh; let us flee
far from covetousness and extortion; and from disgraceful gains, and the love
of lucre. Let us first gather provisions for our souls for the way, the meat
that will suffice us in the world to come: and let us apply ourselves to holy
works, thereby keeping the sabbath rationally. Those whose office it was to
minister among you according to the law used to offer unto God the appointed
sacrifices, even upon the sabbath: they slew the victims in the temple, and
performed those acts of service which were laid upon them: and no man rebuked
them, and the law itself was silent. It did not therefore forbid men
ministering upon the sabbath. This then was a type for us: for, as I said, it
is our duty, keeping the sabbath in a rational manner, to please God by a sweet
spiritual savour. And, as I have already before said, we render this when
ceasing from sins, we offer unto God as a sacred oblation a life holy and
worthy of admiration, steadily advancing unto all virtue. For this is the
spiritual sacrifice well pleasing unto God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
if, having nought of this in your mind, you cleave <a name="p473"><font color="#000000">|473</font></a> solely
to the grossness of the legal Scripture, abandoning the truth as something you
can not attain to, listen unto God, Who tells you by the voice of the prophet
Isaiah; "The heart of this people is waxed gross, their eyes they have
closed, and made their ears heavy, lest they should see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted,
and I should heal them." For how were not they heavy and without
understanding, and of a mind past helping, who when they might have perceived
that He was the Christ by His teaching being superior to the law, and by the
wonderful works that He wrought, were obdurate, and regarded only their own
preconceived idea of what was right: or rather that only which brought them
down to the pit of destruction?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
what was the miracle of which they were spectators? There was a certain man
before Him who had the dropsy: the Lord therefore asks the lawyers and
Pharisees, whether it is lawful to heal on the sabbath day or not? "But
they, it says, were silent." But why, O lawyer, were you silent? Quote
something from the scriptures; show that the law of Moses ever blamed the doing
good on the sabbath: prove to us that it wishes us to be hardhearted and
unmerciful, because of the rest for our bodies;----that it forbids kindness, in
order that we may honour the sabbath. But this you can not prove from any part
of it. And as they were silent from malice, Christ refutes their immitigable
shamelessness by the convincing arguments which He uses. For "whose son of
yours," He says, "or whose ox shall fall into a pit, and he will not
immediately draw him out on the sabbath day?" If the law forbids the
showing mercy on the sabbath, why do you yourself take compassion on that which
has fallen into the pit? Trouble not yourself about your son's danger upon the
sabbath; rebuke the sting of natural affection, which incites you to feel a
father's love. Commit your child with joy to the grave, that you may honour the
Giver of the law, as knowing that He <a name="p474"><font color="#000000">|474</font></a> is harsh and
unmerciful. Let your friend be in danger, but pay not you the slightest heed
thereto: nay though you hear a young child weeping, and asking for help, say to
it, Die: such is the will of the law. But you will not assent to such
reasonings; you will stretch out your hand to one who is distressed, esteeming
him of more account than the honour due to the law, or rather than a senseless
rest, even if you will not as yet acknowledge that the sabbath ought to be kept
in a spiritual manner. The God of all ceases not to be kind: He is good and
loving unto men: He instituted not the law of Moses as the mediator of
harshness, nor appointed it as a teacher of cruelty, but rather to lead you on
to the love of your neighbour. How you was it fitting that a commandment thus
venerable and worthy of admiration should by the will of God lose its force
upon the sabbath day? Why therefore were you silent, O lawyer? Confessedly
because you had nothing to say. For the force of truth is something great, and
invincible, able to confound the envious mind, and to muzzle the faultfinding
tongue.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

then no further heed to the envyings of the Jews, He delivers from his malady
the man afflicted with the dropsy, and tyrannized over by an incurable disease.
You have seen O Jew, the miracle: extol then the Worker of it. Understand His
might, and the gloriousness of His dominion: acknowledge that He is God: offer
Him your faith: be not obdurate; but as the prophet Jeremiah says, "Rend
your hearts, and not your garments." Expand your mind: open the eye of
yours heart: understand that the acts which He works are those of Deity, even
though in appearance He be a man like unto us. Recognize therefore Him Who for
our sakes bore our likeness, but even so was far above us: or rather far above
all creation by His ineffable generation from God the Father. For He is the Son
of Him Who transcends all, but though He was Lord He <a name="p475"><font color="#000000">|475</font></a> took
the form of the slave, that He might make the slave like unto Himself: yet He
did not cease to be God, but remains the Same, Whom angels worship, and
principalities, and thrones, and lordships. The Seraphim praise Him: and let us
also serve Him in faith, mounting upward by His aid to the lot of the saints;
by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion with the Holy
Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p476"><font color="#000000">|476</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And He spoke a parable unto them which were bidden preventing how they chose

yourself at the head of the seat, lest a more honourable man than you be bidden
of him; and when he that bade you and him comes, he say to you, Give this man

bidden, go seat yourself in the lowest place, that when he that bade you comes,

does the Saviour cease from doing some act or other replete with benefit, guiding
by admonitions and counsels all who draw near unto Him into propriety of
conduct, and teaching them that sobriety which becomes saints, that as Paul
says, "the man of God may be perfect, complete unto every good work."
Seizing therefore every opportunity, however slight, for His words, He wove for
us admonitions well worthy of our attention, therein resembling an active
husbandman; for whatsoever is liable to blame and reprehension, and covers with
utter infamy those who are guilty of it, this He cuts away from our minds, and
plants, so to speak, every fruit of virtue: for "we, as Scripture says,
are God's husbandry."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

benefit then He has here too discovered for us, we learn from the passage now

special request. <a name="p477"><font color="#000000">|477</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

his purpose in so doing, and motive we explained unto you when last we met
together. But inasmuch as He saw certain of those who were invited foolishly
seizing the uppermost seats as a thing of importance, and worth the taking, and
that they were eager after vainglory, for the benefit both of them and us He
utters an urgent warning, saying; "When you are bidden of any one, seat
not yourself at the head of the seat, lest a more honourable man than you be
bidden of him, and when he that bade you and him comes, he say unto you, Give
this man place; and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

such things may seem perchance to some to be but trifling matters, and not
worthy of much attention. But when any one fixes upon them the eye of his mind,
he will then learn, from what blame they deliver a man, and how great
orderliness they produce in him. For in the first place to hurry
inconsiderately after honours neither suitable,, nor due to us, shows us to be
foolish, rude, and arrogant, seizing what is not fitting for us, but for others
rather, who are greater than and superior to ourselves. Whoever he is that thus
acts, is hated, and often too becomes an object of ridicule, when he has to
restore to others, and that often against his will, the honour which in no
respect belongs unto him. "For when, He says, a more honourable man than
you comes, he that bade you and him will say, Give this man place." O!
what great ignominy is there in having so to do! It is like a theft, so to
speak, and the restitution of the stolen goods. He must restore what he has
seized; for he had no right to take it. But the modest and praiseworthy man,
who might without fear of blame have claimed the dignity of sitting among the foremost,
seeks it not, but yields to others what might be called his own, that he may
not even seem to be overcome by vainglory; and such an one shall receive honour
as his due: for he shall hear, He says, him who bade him say, "Come up
hither."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">A
modest mind therefore is a great and surpassing good: for it delivers those who
possess it from blame and contempt, and from the charge of vaingloriousness.
'But yes! says the lover of vainglory, I wish to be illustrious and renowned,
and not despised and neglected, and numbered among the <a name="p478"><font color="#000000">|478</font></a> 
unknown.' If however you desire this transitory and human glory, you are
wandering away from the right path, by which you might become truly
illustrious, and attain to such praise as is worthy of emulation. For it is
written, "All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of
grass." And the prophet David also blames those who love temporal honours;
for he also thus spoke of them, "Let them be as the grass upon the
housetops, which withers before it is plucked up." For just as the grass
that springs up upon the housetops has no deep fixed root, and for this reason
is easily parched up; so he who values worldly honour, after he has been for a
short time conspicuous, and, so to speak, in flower, sinks at last into nothingness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">If
then any one wish to be set above others, let him win it by the decree of
heaven, and be crowned by those honours which God bestows. Let him surpass the
many by having the testimony of glorious virtues; but the rule of virtue is a
lowly mind that loves not boasting: yes! it is humility. And this the blessed
Paul also counted worthy of all esteem: for he writes to such as are eagerly
desirous of saintly pursuits, "Love humility." And' the disciple of
Christ praises it, thus writing; "Let the poor brother glory in his
exaltation: and the rich in his humiliation, because as the flower of the grass
he passes away." For the moderate and bridled mind is exalted with God:
for "God, it says, will not despise the contrite and abased heart."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
whosoever thinks great things of himself, and is supercilious, and elate in
mind, and prides himself on an empty loftiness, is rejected and accursed. He
follows a course the contrary of Christ's, Who said; "Learn of Me, for I
am meek and lowly in heart." "For the Lord, it says, resists the
proud, but gives grace to the humble." The wise Solomon also shows in many
places the safety of the humble mind; at one time saying, "Exalt not
yourself, that you fall not:" and at another time, he figuratively declares
the same thing; "He that makes his house high, seeks an overthrow."
Such a one is hated of God, and very justly, as having mistaken himself, and
senselessly aimed above the limits of his nature. For upon what ground, I pray,
does man upon earth think great things of himself? For certainly his mind is
weak, and <a name="p479"><font color="#000000">|479</font></a> easily led into base pleasures: his body is
tyrannized over by corruption and death: and the duration of his life is short
and limited. Nor is this all, for naked were we born, and therefore riches, and
wealth, and worldly honour come to us from without, and are not really ours:
for they belong not to the properties of our nature. For what reason therefore
is the mind of man puffed up? What is there to exalt it to superciliousness and
boasting? Were any one but to regard his state with understanding eyes, he
would then become like Abraham, who mistook not his nature, and called himself
"dust and ashes." And like another also who says; "Quit man who
is rottenness, and the son of man who is a worm." But he who is a worm and
rottenness; this dust and ashes: this very nothingness becomes great and
admirable and honourable before God, by knowing himself; for so he is crowned
by God with honour and praise: for the Saviour of all and Lord gives grace to
the humble: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion,
with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p480"><font color="#000000">|480</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

indeed is the beauty of the mind of man: and it shows itself in various ways,
and is conspicuous in a diversity of manners. For just as those who are skilled
in delineating forms in pictures cannot by one colour attain to perfect beauty
in their painting, but rather use various and many kinds of hues; so also the
God of all, Who is the Giver and Teacher of spiritual beauty, adorns our souls
with that manifold virtue which consists in all saintlike excellence of living,
in order to complete in us His likeness. For in His rational creatures the best
and most excellent beauty is the likeness of God, which is wrought in us by the
exact vision of God, and by virtue perfected by active exertion. Consider
therefore how our Lord Jesus Christ makes our souls beautiful by every
spiritual adornment. For here He had commanded the Pharisees and lawyers, or
rather, the Scribes, to think lowly of themselves, and to cultivate a mind free
from the love of vainglory, bidding them not to seize upon the foremost seats.
For He was dining with them, that being in their company He might benefit them
even against their will. And after them He next addressed him who had invited
them, and assembled them to the entertainment, saying, "When you make a
dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brethren, neither your
kinsmen nor your rich neighbours: but rather the lame, and the blind, and the
maimed."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

He then produce in us a morose state of mind? Is it His will that we be
unsociable, and unloving, so as not even to deem our friends and relatives
worthy of that affection which <a name="p481"><font color="#000000">|481</font></a> especially is fitting and
due to them? Are we to pay no regard to those who are near us in affection and
love? Does He forbid the rights of hospitality? But how is it not absurd and
ignorant to imagine that He contradicts His own laws? What then does He wish to
teach? Something perhaps like what follows; Those who possess great store of
wealth make much account, so to speak, of a constant display and ostentation.
For oftentimes they bring men to banquet with them, and make entertainments at
vast cost, with curiously prepared viands, and such as do not escape the blame
of prodigality. And this it is their custom to do, in order to gain the praises
and applause of their guests. And in receiving the praises of their flatterers,
as the wages, so to speak, of their extravagance, they rejoice greatly, as
though they had gained something of value. For it is the habit of flatterers to
praise oven those things which deserve blame.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
what good is there in such prodigal abundance beyond what necessity requires?
For as Christ Himself somewhere said, "Few things are needful, or
one," for the necessary appeasing of the wants of the body. That we may
escape therefore the danger of losing the reward of our outlay, by expending
our wealth in such pursuits as will bear good fruit, He has commanded us to
invite the poor, and the maimed, and the blind, and those who are suffering
under other bodily maladies; that by our liberality in so doing, we may attain
to the hope that comes from above from God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
lesson therefore which He teaches us is love unto the poor, which is a thing
precious in the sight of God. Do you feel pleasure in being praised when you
have any friends of relatives feasting with you? I tell you of something far
better: angels shall praise your bounty, and the rational powers above, and
holy men as well: and He too shall accept it Who transcends all, and Who loves
mercy and is kind. Lend unto Him fearing nothing, and you shall receive with
usury whatever you gave: "for he, it says, who has pity on the poor lends
unto God." He acknowledged the loan, and promises repayment. "For
when the Son of man, He says, shall come in the glory of His Father, with the
holy angels, and shall sit upon the throne of His glory, He shall set the sheep
upon His right hand, and the goats upon His left. <a name="p482"><font color="#000000">|482</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

He shall say to them on His right hand, Come you blessed of My Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world: for I was
hungry and you gave Me meat: I was thirsty and you gave Me drink: I was naked
and you covered Me: sick and you visited Me: in prison, and you came unto Me.
And to this He added, Verily I say unto you, that whatsoever you have done to
one of these little ones, you have done unto Me." The outlay therefore is
not unfruitful: rather shall compassion upon the poor make your wealth breathe
forth a sweet savour. Purchase the grace that comes from God; buy for your
friend the Lord of heaven and earth: for verily we oftentimes purchase men's
friendship with large sums of gold, and if those of high rank are reconciled
unto us, we feel great joy in offering them presents even beyond what we can
afford, because of the honour which accrues to us from them. And yet these
things are but transitory, and quickly fade away, and are like the phantasies
of dreams.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
to be members of God's household, must we not count that as a thing worth the
gaining; and esteem it as of the highest importance? For certainly after the
resurrection from the dead we must stand in Christ's presence; and there a
recompense shall of necessity be made to the compassionate and merciful: but a
condemnation commensurate with their deeds shall be the lot of those who were
harsh and without mutual love; for it is written, "that there is judgment
without mercy for those who have showed no mercy." And if so, how is it
not the proof and perfection of a sound mind, that before we descend to the pit
of torment we should take forethought for our life? For come, and let us
discuss this among ourselves. Suppose that for some cause or other which the
law condemned they had dragged us before the judges, and so a sentence such as
our offences deserved had been passed upon us after our conviction; should we
not with pleasure offer up our wealth to escape from all torment and
punishment? And how can there be any doubt of this? For oneself is better than
possessions, and life than wealth. Now we are guilty of many sins, and must
give an account to the Judge of whatsoever we have done; and why then do we not
deliver ourselves from judgment and the everlasting fire while time permits?
And the <a name="p483"><font color="#000000">|483</font></a> way in which to deliver ourselves is to live in
virtue;----to comfort the brethren who are grieved with poverty, and open our
hand wide to all who are in need, and to sympathize with the sick.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
tell me what is harder than poverty, that implacable beast of prey, that bane
which no admonition can charm away, that worst of maladies, or rather more
cruel than any malady? We therefore must give a helping hand to those who are
suffering under it: we must open wide to them our heart, and not pass by their
lamentation. For suppose a savage beast of prey had sprung upon some wayfarer,
would not any one who witnessed the occurrence seize up any thing that came to
hand, a stone for instance, or stick, and drive away the beast that was
mercilessly rending and tearing the man fallen beneath its blow? Who is so
hardhearted and full of hatred to mankind as to pass by one thus miserably
perishing? And must not you own, that poverty, as I said, is more cruel than
any beast of prey? Aid therefore those who are fallen under it: incline yours
ear to the poor, and listen to him, as it is written, "For he, it says,
who stops his ears that he may not hear the feeble, he also shall cry, and
there shall be none to listen." Give that you may receive: hear that you
may be heard: sow your little that you may reap much. And besides, the pleasure
of the body is short and temporary, and ends in rottenness: but almsgiving and
charity to the poor crown those who practise them with glory from God, and lead
them to that incorruptible happiness which Christ bestows on those who love
Him: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the

the purport of the lessons laid before us obliges me to say, that the fruit of
good works is praiseworthy. For not unrewarded is the toil of the saints, as
they strenuously labour to lead that life which is truly worthy of admiration
both with God and men. For the wise Paul writes, "For God is not
unrighteous to forget your labour and your love, which you have showed unto His
Name." And again in another place he uses similar words, "For the lightness,
he says, of our present affliction works for us abundantly and in a higher
degree an eternal greatness of glory, when we look not at the things which are
seen, but at those which are not seen; for the things which are seen are those
of time, but the things which are not seen are for eternity." For the
things of time are those of <a name="p485"><font color="#000000">|485</font></a> earth; and these we say are
what are here called "the things which are seen:" but those which are
to come, and which at present are not seen, but consist in those hopes which,

who they are for whom these things are prepared, and unto whom they will be
given, the Saviour has here shown, portraying as in a picture by the parable

Lord then was feasting at a certain Pharisee's, in company with many others
assembled there, the friends of him who had bidden them to the entertainment,
and the sharers of his sentiments. There again the Saviour of all, to benefit
those who were gathered there,----for He loves mercy rather, and not honour and
vainglory;----perfected him that invited them, by not permitting him to make
lavish expense, or aim at what was beyond his means, to gain the praise of men.
For He said, "When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends,
nor your brethren, nor further, any others who are rich and your neighbours: but
rather the poor, and the maimed, and the blind. For those, He said, who so act
shall be blessed at the resurrection of the just." Upon which one of those
who were reclining with them at meat, on hearing words thus excellent, said,
"Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God." Probably
however this man was not as yet spiritual, but rather animal, nor fitted to
understand correctly what was spoken by Christ: for he was not one of those who
believed, nor had he as yet been baptized. For he supposed that the rewards of
the saints, for their mutual labours of love, would be in things pertaining to
the body. Because then they were too dull in heart to comprehend a precise
idea, Christ frames for them a parable which with sufficient appositeness sets
forth the nature of the dispensation about to be instituted for their sakes:
and says, "A certain man made a great supper, and bade many. And he sent

invite to the supper; and who also is the inviter, and who in fine they are who
were invited, but despised the summons.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">By
the man therefore is to be understood God the Father. For similitudes are
formed to represent the truth, and are by no means the truth themselves. He
therefore, the Creator of the universe, and the Father of glory, made a great
supper, that is, a festival for the whole world, in honour of Christ. In the
last times then of the world, and. so to speak, at this our world's setting,
the Son arose for us: at which time also He suffered death for our sakes, and
gave us His flesh to eat, as being the bread from heaven, Which gives life to
the world. Towards evening also, and by the light of torches, the lamb was
sacrificed, according to the law of Moses. And therefore with good reason the invitation
that is by Christ is called a supper.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
next, who is he that was sent, and who it also says was a slave? Perchance
Christ Himself: for though God the Word is by nature God, and the very Son of
God the Father, from Whom He was manifested, yet He emptied Himself, to take
the form of a slave. As being therefore God of God He is Lord of all; but one
may justly apply the appellation of a slave to the limits of His humanity. Yet
though He had taken, as I said, the form of a slave, He was even so Lord as
being God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
when was He sent? At supper time, it says. For it was not at the commencement
of this world that the only-begotten Word of the Father descended from heaven,
and was in form like unto us; but rather when the Omnipotent Himself willed it,
even in these latter times, as also we have already said.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
what was the nature of the invitation? "Come: for lo! all things are
ready." For God the Father has prepared in Christ for the inhabitants of
earth those gifts which are bestowed upon the world through Him, even the
forgiveness of sins, the cleansing away of all defilement, the communion of the
Holy Spirit, the glorious adoption as sons, and the kingdom of heaven. Unto
these blessings Christ invited by the commandments of the gospel Israel before all
others. For somewhere He has even said by the voice of the Psalmist; "But
I have been set as a king by Him; that is, by God the Father; <a name="p487"><font color="#000000">|487</font></a>
upon Zion His holy mount, to preach the commandment of the Lord." And
again, "I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
Israel."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
their determination then, was it for their own good? Did they regard with
admiration the gentleness of Him Who bade them, and the office of Him Who
ministered the call? Not so: for "they began, it says, all of them at once
to make excuse:" that is, as with one purpose, without any delay, they
made excuse. "For the first said, I have bought a field, and I must needs
go to see it: I pray you, permit me to be excused. And another said, I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them: I pray you, permit me to be
excused. And another said, I have taken a wife, and therefore I cannot
come." You perceive that by senselessly giving themselves up to these
earthly matters, they cannot see things spiritual; for being overcome by the
love of the flesh, they are far from holiness, and are covetous and greedy
after wealth. They seek those things which are below, but make no account, no
not in the slightest degree, of those hopes which are stored up with God. Far
better would it have been instead of earthly fields to gain the joys of
paradise: and instead of transitory tillage, for this was the object of the
yokes of oxen, to gather the fruits of righteousness. For it is written,
"Sow for yourselves righteousness; gather as vintage the fruit of
life." Was it not their duty rather, instead of the carnal procreation of
children, to have chosen spiritual fruitfulness? For the one is subject unto
death and corruption: the other is an eternal and abiding; affluence for the
saints.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
then the householder heard their refusal, he was angry, it says; and commanded
that from the streets and marketplaces of the city there should be gathered the
poor, and the maimed, and the blind, and the lame. And who then are to be
understood by those who for the sake, as I said, of lands, and tillage, and the
carnal procreation of children, refused to come? Certainly it must be those,
who stood at the head of the Jewish synagogue; men with wealthy purses, the
slaves of covetousness, with their mind set on lucre, on which they lavished
all their earnestness. For so to speak throughout <a name="p488"><font color="#000000">|488</font></a> the
whole of inspired Scripture, one may see them blamed for this very thing.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Those
then who were superior in station to the mass of the common people did not
submit themselves to Christ, when, saying unto them, "Take My yoke upon
you:" they rejected the invitation: they did not accept the faith; they
remained away from the feast; and scorned the great supper by their hardened
disobedience. For that the scribes and Pharisees did not believe in Christ, is
manifest by what He says unto them, "You have taken away the key of
knowledge: you enter not in yourselves: and those that are entering you have
hindered." In their stead therefore those were called who were in the
streets and market-places, who belonged, that is, to the Jewish common people,
whose mind was sickly, and infirm, and dark, and halting: for such one may
consider to be blind and lame. But they became strong and whole in Christ: they
learnt to walk uprightly, and received the divine light into their mind. And
that a multitude of the Jews not easy to number believed, one may learn from
the Acts of the Apostles.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
then those, it says, who were in the streets had been called, he whose office
it was to bid them to the supper said to the householder, "Still there is
room. And the lord said to his servant. Go out into the highways and hedges,
and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. For I say unto you,
that no one of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Here
observe, I pray, the calling of the Gentiles after that the Israelites had
entered by faith.. For in old time the Gentiles were boorish in mind, and
uncultivated in understanding, and so to say, outside the city, as living in
lawlessness, and more like cattle than men, and with little use of reason. And
on this account he who invites to the supper is sent unto the highways, outside
the city, and to the hedges in the fields: <a name="p489"><font color="#000000">|489</font></a> moreover he is
commanded by him who seat him not merely to invite, and offer them exhortation
only, but even to compel them. And yet in all men faith is a voluntary act, and
by attaining unto it of their own free will, men are acceptable unto God, and
largely endowed with His gifts. How then are men compelled? Yes, this also was
said advisedly. For it was necessary, absolutely necessary for the Gentiles, as
being fettered by an intolerable tyranny, and fallen under the yoke of the
devil, and caught, so to speak, in the indissoluble meshes of their sins, and
utterly ignorant of Him Who by nature and verily is God, that their calling
should be very urgent, resembling the use of force, that they might be able to
look up unto God, and taste the sacred doctrines, and leave off their former
error, and spring away as it were from the hand of Satan. For Christ also said,
"No man can come unto Me except My Father Who sent Me drag him." But
dragging implies that the calling is an act of power such as God only can
exercise. And the blessed David is also found addressing God in similar terms
respecting them, "With bridle and bit shall You restrain the jaws of those
that draw not near unto You." You see how the God of all as with a bridle
turns unto Himself those who fiercely have departed from Him: for He is good and
loving unto mankind, and wills that all men should be saved, and come unto the
knowledge of the truth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
chiefs therefore of the Israelitish populace remained aloof from the supper, as
being obdurate and proud and disobedient, and scorned so surpassing an invitation,
because they had turned aside to earthly things, and fixed their mind upon the
vain distractions of this world. But the vulgar multitude was called in, and
after them immediately and without delay the Gentiles. For when our Lord Jesus
Christ arose from the dead, He cried out unto the holy apostles saying, "
All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth: go make disciples of all
nations, baptizing you them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit: and teaching you them to observe all those things that I have
commanded you: and lo! I am with you every day even unto the end of the
world." <a name="p490"><font color="#000000">|490</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And great multitudes went with Him: and He turned and said unto them;
Whosoever cometh unto Me, and hates not his father and his mother, and his
wife, and his children, and his brethren, and his sisters: yes, and his own
self also, he cannot be My disciple. And whosoever does not bear his cross, and
come after Me, cannot be My disciple. For which of you, that wishes to build a
tower, sits not down first, and counts the cost, to see whether he have
sufficient to finish it? Lest when he has laid the foundation, and is not able
to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to
build, and was not able to finish. Or what king going to make war with another
king, sits not down first and consider, whether he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand? And if he be not, while
the other is yet afar off, he sends ambasssadors, and asks conditions of peace.
So therefore every one of you that forsakes not all his possessions, cannot be
My disciple. Halt therefore is good: but if the salt have no savour, with what
shall it be seasoned? It is useful neither for the land, nor yet for the
dunghill: they cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

who command warlike armies, and have won for themselves martial glory, whenever
the time for battle has arrived, instruct the troops under their orders in what
way, arraying themselves manfully against the phalanxes of the enemy, they will
gain a triumphant victory. And the Saviour of all, imitating the skilfulness of
those here mentioned, very clearly shows unto all who would follow Him, the
pathway of spiritual manfulness: that advancing with unrestrainable impetuosity
unto every triumph of piety, and exerting a stern and irresistible earnestness,
they may win by a just decree the right of being with Him, and following Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">This
lesson then clearly teaches us, what sort of persons He <a name="p491"><font color="#000000">|491</font></a>
would have us to be. "For whosoever comes unto Me, He says, and hates not
his father and his mother, and his wife and his children, and his brethren, and
his sisters, yes, and his own self also, cannot be My disciple." 'What
then, O Lord, some perchance may say, do You despise the laws of natural
affection? Do You command us to hate one another, and to disregard the love
that is due to fathers from their sons, to wives from their husbands, to
brethren from their brethren? Shall we make those enemies who are members of
the same household; and those, whom it is our duty rather to love, must we
count as foes, in order that we may be with you, and be able to follow you?'</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">This
is not what the Saviour means. Away with so vain a a thought. For He Who
commands even those who are violent enemies to be gentle, and forgiving to all
who would do them wrong: for, "Love, He says, your enemies: and pray for
them that spoil you:" how could He wish us to hate those who are born of
the same family, and to disregard the honour due to parents, and think nothing
of despising our brethren; yes! and our own children also, and even our own
self? For He, Who has pronounced condemnation even upon those who disregard the
law of mutual love, could not wish His friends to cherish a savage, and so to
speak, a desperate state of minds. What however He does wish to teach in these
commands is plain to those who can understand from what is said in another
place expressly upon the same subject. "For he that loves, He says, father
or mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me: and he that loves son or daughter
more Me, is not worthy of Me." By adding then "more than Me," it
is plain that He permits us to love, but not more than we do Him. For He
demands for Himself our chief affection; and that very justly: for the love of
God in those who are perfect in mind has something in it superior both to <a name="p492"><font color="#000000">|492</font></a> the honour due to parents, and to the natural affection felt
for children.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"We
must explain however what the occasion was which directed our Lord's words to
this subject. The passage then read from the Gospel at our last meeting
described the celebration of a great supper, unto which many were invited by
him who gave the feast. But they were men indifferent to it: for "they
made excuse, it says, with one accord, and said, one that he had bought a
field, and must needs go to see it: and another, that he had bought five yoke
of oxen: and a third again, that he had married a wife:" and by employing
these feigned excuses, they vexed him who invited them. We are therefore given
most clearly to understand, that when God calls us unto Him, to make us
partakers of His bounty, we must disregard the lusts that are of the flesh, and
minister to the flesh, and set no value whatsoever upon the things of this
world, but exerting all our force must advance unto those things which will
never have to be abandoned, and which fill us with all blessedness, as God
bestows with bounteous hand upon us His gifts, and like one welcoming us to a
costly banquet, admits us to the right of rejoicing with the rest of the saints
in the hope of future blessings. For the things of earth, are but of little
value and last only for a time, and belong to the flesh solely, which is the
victim of corruption: but those things which are divine and spiritual
constantly and without ceasing accompany those who have once been counted
worthy of receiving them, and reach onwards to unending worlds. What value
therefore will men of sense set upon earthly farms, or the love of carnal
pleasure, or the respect due to kinsmen in the flesh, if it be laid down that
for love's sake unto Christ, we must disregard all these things that have been
named? For many instances have there been of men desirous of a blameless life,
who even after touching, so to speak, the dust of the palaestra, and making
trial of the combats therein, and all but attaining to the right of receiving
the crown of the heavenly calling, have been drawn backward, as it were, either
from regard to relatives, or from being too weak to bear a struggle of
endurance, or from being entangled in the snares of carnality, and foolishly
preferring present pleasure to the <a name="p493"><font color="#000000">|493</font></a> blessings laid up in
hope. Many too the feav of death has terrified, and when the season called them
unto persecutions, that being proved they might receive the crown of
incorruption, they have denied the faith, have avoided, that is, the duty of
suffering patiently, and having shown themselves weak and cowardly, have fallen
from their steadfastness. To work in us therefore a mind incapable of being
broken, and make us careless of every worldly matter for our love of Him, He
commands us to hate even our relatives according to the flesh, and our own self
also, if, as I have just said, the season call us thereto.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
next He uses two examples, to encourage unto an invincible fortitude those who
are His friends, and to establish in an unwavering zeal those whose desire it
is to attain to honours by patience and endurance. "For if, says He, any
one wish to build a tower, he reckons first if he have means sufficient to
finish it, lest when he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it,
men laugh at him." For those whose choice it is to lead a glorious and
blameless life ought to store up beforehand in their mind a zeal sufficient
thereunto, and to remember him who says, "My son, if you draw near to
serve the Lord, prepare yourself for every temptation: make your heart
straight, and endure.'" But those who have no such zeal, how will they be
able to reach the mark that is set before them?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"Or
what king, He says, wishing to make war with another king, does not consider
with himself, whether with his ten thousand he can prevail over one who is more
mighty than himself?" And what does this mean? "Our wrestle is not
against blood and flesh, but against governments; against empires; against the
worldholders of this darkness; against wicked spirits in the heavenly
regions." We have too a crowd, as it were, of other enemies, the carnal
mind, the law that rages in our members, passions of many kinds, the lust of
pleasure, the lust of the flesh, the lust of wealth, and others: with these we
must wrestle; this is our savage troop of enemies. How therefore shall we
conquer? By believing that "in God we shall do valiantly, as Scripture
says, and He shall bring to naught those that oppress us:" In this
confidence one of the holy prophets said, "Behold the Lord helps <a name="p494"><font color="#000000">|494</font></a> me: who shall make me ashamed?" And the divine David
also sings, "The Lord is my light, and my Saviour: whom shall I fear? The
Lord is the helper of my life, at whom shall I tremble?" For He is our
strength, and by Him we shall gain victory: for He has given unto us to tread
upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy. As therefore
He says, "Salt is good: but if the salt be tasteless, with what can it be
seasoned? It is cast out," He says. Let there be therefore, He proceeds,
salt in you," that is, the divine words which bring salvation: but which
if we despise, we become without savour, and foolish, and utterly useless. Such
things must the congregation of the saints cast out, by the gift unto them of
mercy and love from Christ, the Saviour of us all; by Whom and with Whom to God
the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever,
Amen. <a name="p495"><font color="#000000">|495</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

it came to pass that on the second-first Saturday, as He was passing through

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is not
only by the content of his words, but by the very practice and example of his
acts, that the Lord Jesus begins to strip man of the observance of the Old Law
and to put it on of the new garment of grace. So He is now taking the Sabbath
day through the cultures, that is, applying it to fruitful works. What does the
Sabbath mean, the harvest, the ears? It's not a little mystery. The field is
everyone present; the harvest of the field is, by the sowing of the human race,
the abundant harvest of the saints; the ears of the field, the fruits of the
Church, which the Apostles stirred by their activity, nourishing and feeding on
our progress. She was therefore on her feet, the rich harvest of virtues, with
many ears of corn, to which are compared the fruits of our merits; for like
them, bad weather spoils them, or the sun grows them, or the rains stifle them,
or the storms break them, or the reapers pile them up in the deposit of the
blessed granaries. The earth, therefore, had already received the word of God,
and, seeded by the grain of heaven, the field of nourishment had produced rich
harvests. The disciples were hungry for the salvation of men, and seemed to
extract from the hedge of bodies the fruit of souls, drawn to the light of
faith by the brilliant prodigies they were operating. But the Jews thought that
it was not allowed on the Sabbath; Christ, by a new blessing of grace,
emphasized the idleness of the Law, the action of grace.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> And
it is not, I think, without mystery that in Matthew and Mark the evangelist
simply mentioned the Sabbaths: for it is Sabbaths that endless recreation of
the eternal resurrection. So, either in this century, where the superstitions
of the Jews rest and go, or in the other, where we ourselves will celebrate the
holidays of an endless solemnity, we will eat the goods of the earth, according
as it is wrote, "They will eat, while you are hungry" (Is., LXV, 13).
It is remarkable, however, that in Luke the second-first Sabbath is spoken, not
the first-second: for it is written: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . It was necessary
to give the step to what is better. Second Sabbath, because a first came first
under the Law, where a punishment was prescribed for whoever would work; first,
because this Sabbath of the Law, which was first, was abolished, and this one
was the first that was instituted second. For since it is permissible to work
on the sabbath and to work without punishment, from the legal Sabbath which has
ceased to be in force, there is not even the name; since, however, he was the
first by the origin and the other as to the benefit, the latter is not less
because he is second. For Adam is also first and can not be compared to the
second Adam: "The first Adam, living soul; the last Adam, the life-giving
spirit "and" the first man, coming from the earth, is earthly; the
second man from heaven is heavenly "(I Cor. XV, 45, 47). Certainly the
second passes before the first: one causes death, the other life. In the same
way, we speak of a second-first Sabbath: second in numerical order, first in
the benefit realized; for it is better for the Sabbath where punishment is
handed over than for punishment. The Law is first, the Gospel second; yet fear
is inferior to grace. Or, perhaps, first in the determination of the design,
second in the execution of the decision. But it is good that the Lord, in this
passage again, shows in the Law the figure of the future and accuses the
defenders of the Law of ignoring the things of the Law: He quotes the example
of David who, having He hungered him and his companions, entered the house of
God, took the showbread, ate it and gave it to those who were with him (I Sam.,
XXI, 3-6). Great and truly prophetic example, where for the first time we are
shown that we must not attach ourselves to the emptiness of the Law, but to the
solid and the useful. Moreover, as David and his companions fled before King
Saul, this passage of the Law prefigured Christ, who with his Apostles was to
escape from the prince of the world. But how did this observer and advocate
himself eat bread and give it to those who were with him, when only priests
were allowed to eat? to eat, if not to show by this figure that the food of the
priests would be made available to the people, or that we must all imitate the
life of the priests, or that all the children of the Church are priests? We
receive the anointing for a holy priesthood, offering ourselves to God as
spiritual victims (I Peter, II, 5). On the Law therefore spreads the doctrine
of Christ: it does not destroy the Law but fills it, since it does not even
destroy the Sabbath. If the Sabbath was made for man, and if man's utility
demanded that the hungry man, who had long been deprived of the fruits of the
earth, avoid the fasting of the ancient hunger, certainly not destruction of
the law but fulfillment. How then to reproach as a grievance to the Lord what
in the servant is not deemed grievance? And what's more obvious than this
figure that comes back during the whole episode? David entered the house of
Ahimelech the priest; but, in the face of the danger of death, the soul of the
holy priest did not rob the host, nor did he avoid the outlaw. It is the beauty
of hospitality to willingly take upon ourselves the dangers of others. But what
is morality according to history is also prophecy in the mysterious sense: even
in the presence of their loss and death to suffer, the faithful priests would
not refuse the hospitality of their souls to the true David. And we are taught
not only that Christ will find shelter in the home of each priest, but also
that he will take figuratively the remains and weapons of the evil spirits:
because the one who gives hospitality to Christ stripped of his traits the
spiritual Goliath. And what is more clear than this: David, in the house of
Achimelech, asking for five loaves and receiving only one? This figure shows us
that the food of the faithful would be assured not by the Five Books but by the
body of Christ; that Christ would take a body so that none of the faithful
would be hungry. And Doech is not devoid of any figurative sense: he was
guardian of mules, because only the guardian of a sterile flock could realize
the symbol of the traitor Judas. As to the fact that, to have welcomed David,
the whole house of Achimelech was persecuted by Saul, except Abiathar, prince
of the priests of that time (I Sam., XXII, 20), it shows us prophetically that
no one can harm the true Prince of priests, who is the only Christ.</font></span></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></span></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>Luke, VI, 6-11.

So in this passage, the hand extended by Adam to gather the fruits of the forbidden tree, He impregnated it with the salutary sap of the good works, so that, parched by the fault, it was cured by the good works . On this occasion, Christ takes to heart the Jews, who by their false interpretations violated the precepts of the Law, judging that the Sabbath should be released even good works, while the Law prefigured in the present the physiognomy of the future, where surely the evil will not work, not the good. For if the works of this world are put to rest, it is not an act devoid of good work to rest in the praise of God. So you have heard the words of the Lord, "Extend your hand," said II. This is the common remedy, general. And you who believe you have a healthy hand, take care that the advance, take care that sacrilege does not contract it. Extend it often: extend it to the poor man who implores you; extend it to help the neighbor, to help the widow, to wrest from injustice the one whom you see subjected to an unjust vexation; extend it to God for your sins. This is how you extend your hand, as it heals itself. Thus Jeroboam, when he sacrificed to idols, had a contracted hand, and extended it (again) when he prayed to God (I Kings 13:46).<br /></font></span></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></span></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></span></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">

12-49. Sermon on the mountain.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
it came to pass in those days, that he went to the mountain to pray, and spent
the night praying to God." Those who pray do not all climb the mountain -
for it is a prayer that produces sin (Ps.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">7) - but
he who prays well, rising from earthly goods to superiors, climbs the summit of
solicitude from above. But this one does not climb the mountain which cares for
the riches of the world or honors; he does not climb the mountain, he who
covets the possession of the lands of others. He goes up who seeks God; this
one goes up who implores for his march the help of the Lord. All great souls,
all elevated souls ascend the mountain; for it is not on the first comer that
the Prophet says:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Lift
up the high mountain, you who give the good news to Zion; raise your voice with
strength, you who give the good news to Jerusalem "(Is., XL, 9). It is not
by the steps of your body but by high actions that you have to climb this
mountain. Follow Christ, so that you can be a mountain; for "mountains
surround him" (Psalm 124: 2). Look in the gospel, you will find that only
the disciples have climbed the mountain with the Lord.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The Lord
therefore prays: no to beg for Him, but to obtain for me; for although the
Father has placed all things at the disposal of the Son, the Son, however, to
fully realize his condition as a man, judges it opportune to implore the Father
for us: for He is our advocate. Do not set insidious ears, claiming that Christ
asks by weakness to obtain what He can not accomplish, He author of power:
master in obedience, He molds us by his example to the precepts of virtue.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"We
have, it is said, an advocate with the Father" (I Jn, II, 1): if he is a
lawyer, He must intervene for my sins. It is not by weakness, but by kindness,
that he implores. You want to know how much he wants, II can? He is both a
lawyer and a judge: in one is an office of compassion, in the other the badge
of power. "And he spent the night, it is said, praying to God. We give you
an example, we trace you the model that you will have to imitate. What do you
need to do for your salvation, when for you Christ spends the night in prayer?
What should you do when you wish to undertake some pious duty, when Christ, at
the moment of sending his Apostles, prayed and prayed alone? And nowhere else,
if I am not mistaken, we find that he prayed with the Apostles: everywhere He
implores alone. It is because the design of God can not be grasped by human
desires, and no one can share in the intimate thought of Christ. You want to know
how much it is for me, not for Him, that he prayed? "He called his
disciples, he said, and chose twelve of them," to send them, sowers of
faith, to spread the help and salvation of men throughout the universe. Notice
at the same time the heavenly plan: they are not wise, rich, or noble, but
sinners and publicans whom he has chosen to send them, lest they appear to have
been trained by the skill, redeemed by riches, attracted to his grace by the
prestige of power and notoriety; so that victory should remain with the
substance of truth, not with the charm of speech. Judas himself is chosen, not
inadvertently but knowingly. Greatness of the truth that even an enemy minister
can not weaken! What character trait of the Lord, that he preferred to
compromise in our eyes his judgment that his love! He had taken charge of human
weakness, and since then he has not refused this very aspect of human weakness.
He wanted abandonment, He wanted betrayal, He wanted the betrayal of his
apostle, so that you, if a companion abandons you, if a companion betrays you,
you take with calm, the error of your judgment, the waste of your benefit.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"And
he went down with them, it is said, and stopped on a plateau."</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Consider
all things carefully: how He ascends with the Apostles and descends to the
crowds. How, indeed, would the crowd see Christ, if not below? She does not
follow him on the heights, she does not rise to the summits. As soon as he goes
down, he finds the infirm, for the infirm can not be on the heights. Matthew
(VIII, 1) also tells us that the sick were healed in the plains: for each one
was healed, so that his forces progressing little by little, he could climb the
mountain; He also heals in the plain, that is to say, he avoids disorder, and
removes the disgrace of blindness. He descended to our wounds, in order to make
us, by his intimacy and his commerce, participate in his celestial nature. He
cured them, it is true, but leaving them below. "Seeing the crowds - you
read it - He climbs the mountain. And when He was sitting, His disciples went
up to him. "</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">At the
moment of evangelizing and drawing divine treasures the oracles of the
beatitudes, He begins to be higher. But even here, while in the plain, He
looked up. In the same way, during the resurrection of Lazarus, He shuddered in
his spirit (Jn, XI, 33); in the same way he raised his head when He forgave his
sins to the adulterous woman (Jn, VIII, 10). What to lift the eyes, if not open
the inner look? St. Matthew then says, "He opened his mouth," that
is, the treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge, opening the sanctuary of his
temple. He opened his mouth; so you too open your mouth; but beg first that it
opens. If indeed Paul asks for help to open his mouth (Ephesians 6: 19), it is
even more fitting for you to implore. The Prophet also shows you the key to the
science by which you must open your mouth, when he says: "Open your mouth
by the word of God" (Prov., XXXI, 9). The word of God is the key of your
mouth; the key to science is the key to your mouth, through which the chains of
silence once detached open the bars of ignorance.</span></p>

This bliss was first placed by both evangelists. It is indeed the first
according to order, and as mother and generator of virtues: for it is by
despising the goods of the world that the eternals will be deserved; and no one

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Come, Lord
Jesus; teach us the order of your beatitudes. For it is not without order that
you first said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, and secondly blessed are the
meek, and the third blessed are those who mourn. Although I know something
about it, I only know part of it; For if Paul knew in part (I Cor., XIII, 9),
what can I know? I am below Paul by my life, and just as much by the word: for
life produces and acquires speech; the word without life is not the word of
God. As Paul is wiser than me! He prides himself on perils (II Cor., XII, 5),
me successes; he prides himself on not being exalted by his revelations; if I
had any revelations, I would boast of it. But, however, God can bring forth
stones from men (Matt. III, 9), draw the word out of closed mouths, cause
speech to be produced to the dumb; If he has opened the eyes of the donkey so
that she may see the angel (Num. XXII, 27), He has the power to open our eyes
too, so that we may see the mystery of God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Blessed,"
said II, "the poor. The poor are not all blessed; because poverty is a
neutral thing: there can be good and bad poor people. Unless you hear that the
poor blessed is the one described by the Prophet saying that "better a
poor poor than a rich liar" (Prov., XIX, 22). Blessed is the poor man who
cried out and the Lord answered (Ps. 33: 7): poor of sin, poor of vices, poor
to whom the prince of the world has not found anything (Jn., Xiv. poor in
imitation of this poor man who, being rich, became poor for us (II Cor., VIII,
9). So Matthew gives the complete explanation: "Blessed," he said,
"the poor in spirit": for the poor in spirit does not swell, nor
exalt himself in his carnal mind. This is the first bliss. Having left all sin,
stripped all malignity, being content with my simplicity, devoid of harm, it
remains for me to moderate my character. What good is it for me to miss the
goods of the world if I am not gentle and tranquil? For to follow the right
path is, of course, to follow Him who says: "Learn from me that I am
gentle and humble of heart" (Matt., XI, 29). So leave all improbity, be devoid
of vices, in accordance with true poverty; soften your feelings, so as not to
irritate you or at least not to sin by irritating yourself, as it is written,
"Be angry, but sin not" (Ps 4: 5). It is glorious to calm emotion by
wisdom; and it is not reputed to be less virtuous to restrain his irritation,
to repress his indignation, than not to be angry at all: although generally the
former is considered calmer, the second braver. That done, remember that you
are a sinner: mourn your sins, mourn your faults. And it is good that the third
blessedness is for those who mourn their sins, for it is the Trinity who
forgives sins. Purify yourself with your tears and wash yourself with your
tears. If you cry about yourself, another one will not have to cry to you: for
if Saul had mourned his sins, Samuel would not have cried over him (I Sam. XV,
35). Everyone has his dead to cry. We are dead when we sin, when we are
satisfied with the bones of the dead. Death is the evil word that comes out of
the mouth: for it comes out of a bad tomb: "Their throat is a gaping
grave" (Ps. 5, 11). So the Apostle says, "Be my imitators" (I
Cor., IV, 16): He wants us to have the memory of our sins. Paul had nothing to
deplore from the moment he believed in Christ; and yet he mourned his past
life: "I am not worthy," said he, "to be called an apostle,
because I have persecuted the Church of God" (I Cor., XV, 9). He therefore
was a sinner before believing, but we sin, we, even after having believed. Let
him who is a sinner weep over him and rebuke himself, to become righteous; for
"the just accuses himself" (Prov., XVIII, 17).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Let us
continue in order, since it is written, "Command me in charity"
(Cant., II, 4). I have left sin, moderated my character, cried my faults: I
become hungry and thirsty for justice. When one is suffering, in the grip of a
serious illness, one is not hungry, because the pain of the evil excludes
hunger. But what is this hunger for justice? What are these loaves whose
righteousness is hungry? Would it not be the loaves of which it is said,
"I was young, and I have grown old, and have not seen the righteous left,
neither his offspring questing his bread" (Ps. 36:25) . Who is hungry, of
course, seeks to increase his strength; but is there comforting greater for
virtue than the rule of justice? After that, "blessed," said the
merciful ones, "for after justice comes mercy. So it is said, "He
distributed, given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever "(Psalm
111: 9). But he who has mercy loses his reward if he does not have a pure heart
in his mercy: for if he seeks to make himself worthy, it is without any fruit.
So purify the inmost of your soul, and when you have carefully purified the
secret of your heart, have compassion on those who have to fight, and understand
how many men, how many of your brothers are asking for your help. But if at
first you free your interior from all taint of sin, so that neither
disagreements nor disputes arise from your dispositions, you can not remedy
others. So begin with you the work of peace, so that once peaceful you
yourself, bring peace to others. How could you cleanse the hearts of others if
you did not purify yours first? You have done a service to others, you have
been helpful to many: hurry to reach the goal. While there were many ways out
of life, only one suited the Lord? because, being born according to the flesh,
He also had to die according to the flesh? He chose suffering, in order to die
for us. Also, concerning all that he has given you, say, "I will take the
chalice of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord" (Ps 115, 13),
which means suffering; so he said to those who wished to sit on his right or
left: "Can you drink the chalice that I have to drink? (Matt, XX, 22). He
leads you to the end, He accompanies you to martyrdom, and He makes it the palm
of the beatitudes.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So
see the order: you must become poor in spirit, because the humility of spirit,
it is the wealth in virtues? if you are poor, you will not be able to be
gentle? whoever is gentle can cry over the present? who weeps over inferior
goods may desire better ones? who seeks higher goods forsakes those from below,
so that he in turn may be helped by those above? who is compassionate purifies
his heart [what is it to purify his soul, if not to efface the defilement of
death? because "alms deliver from death" (Tob., IV, 11)]? as to
patience, is the completion of charity? and whoever suffers persecution,
engaged in the supreme combat, is tested by adversity, to be crowned after
having "fought according to the rules" (II Tim., II, 5).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">These are,
to the feeling of many, the degrees of the virtues by which we can ascend from
the lowest to the highest.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In the
same way, moreover, that there is an increase of virtues, there is also an
increase of rewards: to be son of God is more than to possess the earth and to
obtain consolation. But as long as the first reward is the Kingdom of Heaven,
and the last reward is the Kingdom of Heaven, is there an equal reward for the
beginners and for the perfect? Is it not a matter of teaching us that in the
mystical sense there is a first kingdom of heaven, that of the Apostle:
"Dissolve me and be with Christ? This is the first kingdom, where the
saints are delighted in the clouds to meet Christ in the air; for the multitude
of those who rest will rise, some for eternal life, others for shame (I Thess.,
IV, 17, Dan., XII, 2). So a first kingdom of heaven is promised to the saints
by the liberation of the body; the second kingdom of heaven is, after the
resurrection of bodies, to be with Christ. When you are in the Kingdom of
Heaven, then there is progression in the mansions: although the kingdom is
unique, yet there is diversity of rewards in the Kingdom of Heaven. After the
resurrection you will begin to own your land, being free from death; for he to
whom he says,</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"You
are earth, and in earth you will go" (Gen., III, 19) does not own his
land: one can not be a possessor if one does not collect the fruits. So
released by the cross of the Lord - if you find yourself under the yoke of the
Lord, you will find consolation in the very possession. Consolation is followed
by enjoyment; enjoyment, divine mercy; but he whose Lord hath pity, He calls
him; who is called sees him who calls him; who has seen God is admitted to the
rights of divine filiation: and then finally, as son of God, he enjoys the
riches of the kingdom of heaven. So one begins, the other is filled: for even
in this world many are part of the Roman Empire; but these derive greater
benefit from the Empire, which are closer to the Emperor.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Now let us
say how in four beatitudes S. Luke has enclosed eight beatitudes. Now we know
that there are four cardinal virtues: temperance, justice, prudence, strength.
Who is poor in spirit is not greedy. The one who weeps does not pride himself,
but is gentle and peaceful; who weeps humbles himself. He who is righteous does
not refuse what he knows to be given to all for common use. He who has mercy
gives of his good; who gives of his good does not seek the good of others and
does not set a trap for his neighbor. So there is a link and a link between the
virtues, so that if you have one, you will have several; the saints have their
own virtue, but the one that is more extended has a greater reward. What
hospitality in Abraham! what humility! what fidelity, when he delivers from the
enemy the son of his brother! and what disinterestedness, when he claims
nothing of booty! But as he did by faith, he deserved first of all to be first
by faith. So each one has several rewards, because there are many motives of
virtues; but what is richer in merit is also more rewarded.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Blessed
are the poor in spirit": here you have temperance, who abstains from sin,
tramples on the world, does not seek its attractions. "Blessed are those
who are hungry and thirsty": for when one is hungry one has compassion on
the hungry; having compassion is given; giving, one becomes righteous, for
"his righteousness remains forever" (Psalm 111: 9). So we recognize
in Matthew the spiritual thirst and hunger that makes the food or drink of
justice desire; for this virtue is like the substance of virtues, so that the
righteous puts himself at the level of his inferiors, forbids deception,
searches for the truth.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Blessed
are you who are crying now, for you will smile. Here is the prudence, to whom
is it to weep what passes and seek what is eternal; to cry over the things of
the world, who are making war; to seek the God of peace (Rom. xiv. 33), who
chose foolishness according to the world to confound the wise (I Cor., I, 27
ff.); and who destroys what is not, in order to be able to possess what is.
"Blessed are you when men hate you. You have strength here, but that
which, instead of inciting hatred by crime, suffers persecution by faith; for
it is thus that we come to the crown of suffering, disdaining the favor of men,
and pursuing that of God. As well, to let you know that the completion of the
force is suffering: "It is thus," he says, "that their fathers
treated the prophets"; because the Jews persecuted the prophets until they
killed their bodies. It is still the strength to overcome anger, to restrain
indignation; and in this way strength strengthens the soul and the body
together, and does not leave them to be disturbed by any fear or pain, of those
which often impress upon us like dishonest brokers. So temperance implies the
purity of heart and soul, justice, mercy, prudence, peace, strength and
gentleness.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">"Woe
to you, rich, who have your consolation! "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Although
the abundance of wealth contains many solicitations for evil, there is also
more than an invitation to virtue. Undoubtedly, virtue does not need resources,
and the contribution of the poor is more worthy of praise than the liberality
of the rich; yet those whom he condemns by the authority of the heavenly
sentence are not those who have riches, but those who do not know how to use
them. For if the poor man is more worthy of praise when he gives grace, and
does not allow himself to be stopped by the locks of famine in prospect, not
judging to be poor if he has enough for his condition; in the same way the rich
man is more reprehensible, for he must at least give thanks to God for what he
has received, not to keep hidden and useless a given good for the common good,
not to smear treasures buried in the ground. So it's not the fortune but the
feeling that is at fault. And although at length the miser ascends a guard
anxious, a miserable faction - torture that nothing surpasses - keeping in
anguished fear that will provide wastage of his heirs, however, since the care
of greed and the desire to amass are as if satisfied with a vain enjoyment,
having had the consolation of the present life, they have lost the eternal
reward. Here, however, we can recognize in the rich the Jewish people, or the
heretics, or even the philosophers of the world, who, indulging in the
abundance of words and in the pretentious dichotomy that serves them as
heritage, beyond the simplicity of faith real, amassed useless treasures. Does
such a heretic, when you hear him talk about the generation of the Lord in the
manner of the world, do not seem to you rich in words, poor in meaning? He
thinks he now has opulent wealth, but in the next life he will recognize the
indigence of his faith and, exhausted by the eternal famine of faith, will know
that the food of bad faith, which he belittled in the present time, is the
cause of such a great torture. A time will come when they will lament their
laughter, those who now laugh at our words. It is to them that it is rightly
said: "Woe to you when all men will congratulate you. Does this not seem
to you to appeal to those who, in the old days of the Council of Rimini, were
the architects of an unfair prevarication, seeking for the good graces of the
Emperor, lost the grace of God, in seeking to please the powerful ones indulged
in the eternal curse?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> So,
by means of rewards, Matthew has attracted the people to virtue and faith; this
one (Luke) has also diverted them from the crimes and the sins by the
announcement of the punishments to come; and it is not without reason that, following
his way through the remembrance of many divine deeds, he arrived later at the
point of the Beatitudes, in order to teach the peoples fortified by the divine
miracles to advance beyond from the path of the Law through the march of
virtues. Fear was in order as long as the still crippled people had a hesitant
heart: now it took the sound of the trumpet to awaken courage. This comes out
of the way in which the discourses of this book, those of the beginning, those
of the continuation of the sermon, develop. There those who are still infirm
are as watered from the milk of the Law and by the ways of the Law led to
grace: they hear the things of the Law, so that by following the Law they go
beyond the Law. Here the Church, more firmly established, is no longer watered
with milk, but nourished with food: for it is a solid food, charity. As well,
of these three summits, faith, hope, charity, the greatest is charity. Charity
is therefore ordered when it says, "Love your enemies"; Thus the word
of the Church, quoted above, is realized: "Order in me charity"
(Cant., II, 4): for charity is ordered when the precepts of charity are
formulated. See how He departs from the highest things, and pushes the Law back
from evangelical bliss. The law commands the revenge that avenges itself; the
Gospel gives to enmities charity, benevolence to hatred, wishes to curses, help
to the persecutors, spreads on the hungry patience and the grace of
beneficence. As the athlete is perfect, if he does not feel the insult! And in
order not to seem to destroy the Law, the Lord maintains for the benefits
reciprocity which he discards for insults. But yet, when He says, "As you
want men to do to you, do the same," the good made is more abundant, since
action is adjusted to desires. Virtue does not know how to measure its benefit:
not content to give back what it has received, it wants to increase on what it
has collected, for fear of being inferior in charity, even if the service is
equal.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
because the benefits are not limited by quantity, but by order and time; with
equal benefit, he prevails who first began; the benefactor is the one who has
begun to do well, the debtor the one who has returned. It is, therefore, a
blessing more than the initiative of beneficence: for whoever renders the money
does not pay the benefit, and remains the debtor of the benefit, even if he is
no longer the money; then why think that by rendering the benefit we can be
quit, since to render it testifies to have received it even more than to be
released? The Christian is therefore trained at this good school: not satisfied
with the right of nature, that he seeks delicacy. If all, even sinners, agree
to make affection, the one whose convictions are of a higher order must also
study more generously to virtue, to the point of loving those same who do not
do not like. For if the absence of titles to be loved prevents love from
exercising, it does not prevent virtue. In the same way that you would blush
not to pay back the one who loves you, and that the desire to render a blessing
gives birth to the love of the one you previously did not like; so in the one
who does not love you must love (the occasion of) virtue, so that by loving
virtue you begin to love the one you do not like. As thin and fragile is the
wages of love, eternal that of virtue. But what is so admirable as to stretch
the other cheek to whom you strike? Is not breaking all the impetus of the
indignant man, calm his anger? Will you not, by patience, strike harder the one
who strikes you, because of his regret? Thus will it happen that you will
repulse the insult and obtain the good graces. And often the greatest reasons
for friendship come from the patience rendered for insolence, the benefit for
insult. No doubt, I remember having heard him say, and we believe that at least
on this isolated point the morgue of philosophy has bowed, she has made a
division of justice into three parts: one to God which is called piety; the
other towards the parents and the rest of the human race; the third to the
dead, to render them just funerals. But the Lord Jesus, going beyond the
oracles of the Law and the summits of philosophy, has extended the benefit of
kindness to those who have hurt. And indeed, if the enemy who fought with you
by the arms of war gets by throwing down the arms the pity that saves him; so
often, for the sake of nature, or by virtue of the very law of war, one
consents to grant life to the vanquished, how much more must one consent from
the superior point of view of religion! Because if the warrior is not impressed
by the instinct of conservation, what should not the soldier of peace!</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> Thus
the text of the Apostle: "Charity is patient, benevolent, not envious ....
does not swell" (I Cor., XIII, 4) is shown in these precepts. If she is
patient, she owes patience to those who strike; if she is benevolent, she must
not answer curses; if she does not seek her own property, she must not resist
the thief; if she is not envious, she must not hate her enemy. And yet the
precepts of divine charity go beyond those of the Apostle: to give is more than
to yield; to love enemies is more than not to be envious. All this, the Lord
said it and did it, He who, outraged, did not render the outrage, struck did
not make the strokes, stripped did not resist, crucified asked for forgiveness
for his persecutors themselves, saying, "Father, forgive them this sin,
for they do not know what they do" (Lk. XXIII, 34). He excused from their
crime those who incriminated him. They were preparing the cross, He was giving
salvation and grace in return. And yet, as the application even to the virtues
dulls for lack of reward, He has provided us with the model and guaranteed a
salary from heaven, promising the condition of children of God to those who
would be his imitators. Whoever hastens to the reward should not resist the
example: the more excellent is the reward, the more eager must be the service.
And how great is this salary of mercy! To be admitted to the rights of divine
adoption! Imitate mercy for the benefit.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
benevolence of God unfolds widely: It rains on the ungrateful, the fertile
earth does not refuse its products to the wicked. The same sun of this world
also gives light to sacrilege and religious men. Or, to hear this in the
mystical sense, the Lord watered the people of the Jews with the rains of the
prophecies and shone the rays of the eternal sun for those who did not deserve
them. But since the dew of the world has soddened them, the Church of God is
invited to the heavenly light, though yet they too, if they believe, can expect
the benefit of mercy. He adds that one should not judge lightly, or, having
yourself aware of your fault, pronounce a sentence against another.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Great
lesson still of virtue! Do not wait for the fertility of what is barren, nor
expect a bountiful harvest of the uncultivated. Everyone is reaping the
benefits of what he cultivates. Among the thorns of this world we can not find
the fig tree, which, excelling by the fruitfulness of its fruits, is well
chosen to represent the resurrection: either because, as you have read,
"the fig trees have produced their figs unripe "(Cant., II, 13),
because the fruit first appeared without maturity, useless and obsolete, in the
Synagogue; or because our life is not ripe in this body, is timely in the resurrection.
So we must reject far from us the worries of the century, which gnaw the soul
and dry the mind, if we want to collect the ripe fruits of a diligent culture.
This we can not find in the wasteland of this world, because "we do not
pick the figs on thorns and we do not harvest the grapes on the brambles".
One relates to the world and the resurrection, the other to the soul and the
body: either because no one acquires by sins the fruit of his soul, which, like
the grapes, is spoiled near the earth, ripens up; or because no one can avoid
the damnation of the flesh unless he is redeemed by Christ who, like grapes,
has been suspended from the wood. Far from this flesh, which has been ordered
to sprout briars for the condemned man (Gen., III, 18), let us look up from the
soul, let us stretch out our hands to obtain the harvest of Christ. But He
teaches that the basis of all virtues is obedience to the heavenly precepts, by
which our present dwelling can not be shaken by the overflowing voluptuousness,
by the assault of evil spirits, or by the rain of the world. nor by the cloudy
discussions of heretics.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

"And on the morning of the Sabbath they came very early to the tomb.

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This text
gives rise to a great deal of uncertainty among many: for if we do not see that
the evangelists have contradicted themselves, they have spoken differently. The
latter, in fact, says that "in the morning, very early," Mark:
"In the morning," Matthew: "The evening of the Sabbath,"
John: "The day after the Sabbath, when it was still dark" , the women
came to the tomb. Then he mentions that we saw two men, Mark a young man
sitting, dressed in white, Matthew an angel, John two angels sitting, in white
clothes. Finally, what seems almost insoluble, John writes that it was said to
Mary Magdalene: "Do not touch me, because I have not yet gone back to my
Father"; Matthew wrote that the Lord introduced himself to Mary Magdalene
and another Mary, and described in great detail how they approached, took His
feet, and worshiped Him. What is the solution? Is it not to think that the four
evangelists have spoken of four different moments, and to suppose various
feminine characters and various apparitions? Some also come with perfumes the
day after the Sabbath, others without perfumes on the evening of the Sabbath;
we give the names of some, we mention that the others had followed the Lord
since Galilee.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> For
fear that such would be shocked to end here with the asperities of a thorny
exegesis, while perhaps expected sweet things, do you imagine that we carve the
sails of a speech close to end ; for we arrive at the port, and the vessel
which has traversed the seas of a rapid course, as soon as it begins to
approach the shore, slows down its march to dodge the hidden hulls. So to avoid
failing my speech, like a clumsy pilot, on the sands of the shore, sliding in
some way on the hidden bottomlands, I would rather slow down the march than
rush it, lest our speech should break and do not get swallowed up. It is
therefore necessary first of all to consider what this text means, that the Lord
is risen "on the evening of the Sabbath, while the day after the Sabbath
was coming". You read indeed that "on the Sabbath night Mary
Magdalene and another Mary came to see the tomb; and behold, there was a great
earthquake. So it is not the Sabbath day - for they remained inactive on the
sabbath day, according to the precept - but after the Sabbath day, in the
night, when He rose again. So, coming in the morning, very early, they learned
that the Lord had already risen. 151. It is therefore necessary to believe that
the Resurrection took place neither on Sunday morning, which is the day after
the Sabbath, nor on the Sabbath (for how would one arrive at three days?). It
is not the decline of the day, but the decline of the night, that he is
resurrected. As the Greek says: late, that is to say:? ? ? ? ; but
"late" also means the hour when the day declines, and the delay of
any thing: for example if you say: it was suggested to me late, that is to say
belatedly; he arrived late, that is, arrived after the agreed time. Even if he
arrived in the morning of the next day, it is late, since the time to act has
passed. Late, it is also the time of the deep night, for example when you say:
I got up late to work; it means: I got up not on the evening, but in the middle
of the night. This is what gives women every facility to approach the tomb, the
guards already resting - and why the guards themselves are more frightened, as
happens when one is awakened with a start. Finally the princes of the priests
themselves, in their meeting with the elders, confirm that the event happened
at night, when they say to the guards: "Say that his disciples came at
night and stole him during your stay. sleep "; for it is the hour, on
which the guards have informed them, which has suggested to them the
scaffolding of their deception. In the same way John notes that Mary Magdalene
came to him and to Peter "in the morning, when it was still dark," and
yet the watch unaware that the Resurrection is accomplished: certainly, if it
had taken place at the end of the day, it could have known it immediately. It's
morning, and Pierre does not know yet; Jean does not know. Would the Lord have
suffered that his disciples were tortured longer by the uncertainty of his
death, while immediately the angel, the Lord immediately sent them the women to
announce the event accomplished? And to show you it's night, some women do not
know, others know. They know, those who have kept watch day and night; they do
not know, those who have withdrawn. A Mary Magdalene does not know, according
to John; another Mary Magdalene knows, according to Matthew; because the same
could not know, then not know. So if there are several Marie, there may also be
several Madeleine: the first name is personal, the second is locality. Besides,
learn that it is another: one is allowed to hold the feet of the Lord, the
other forbids touching the Lord; one has deserved to see the angel, the other came
in the first place, did not see anyone: one announced to the disciples that the
Lord was resurrected, the other teaches them that it was removed; one is happy,
the other is crying; to that one Christ already presents himself glorified,
this one seeks him still dead; one saw the Lord and believed, the other could
not recognize him when she saw him; one adored in a sentiment of faith, the
other tormented himself in the uncertainty of his heart.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> It
is precisely that he is forbidden to touch the Lord: it is not by contact with
the body, but by faith, that we touch Christ. "For," said He, "I
am not yet ascended to my Father." which means: I have not yet ascended to
your eyes, since you seek the living among the dead. So she is sent to stronger
ones, whose example will teach her to believe, so that they preach her
resurrection. In the same way, at the beginning, the woman was the instigator
of sin for man, the man con-summing error; In the same way, now whoever had
tasted the first to death saw the first resurrection. According to the order of
the fault, she was the first to remedy; and in order not to suffer without end
before men the reproach of guilt, having transmitted the fault to man, it has
also transmitted grace to him; it compensates for the disaster of ancient decay
by the nuncio of the resurrection. The lips of the woman had formerly given way
to death; a woman's lips make life. But as she has too little constitence to
preach, as her sex is too weak to perform, it is to men that the function of
evangelizing is handed over. For if Jesus, not happy to destroy the fault of
women, multiplies their action, so that many are persuaded by the one who first
deceived one, the man also, who at first had steadily added faith had to
recover an increased gift, and, having once allowed himself to become
credulous, become fit to preach to others. But let us note the very terms of
the mandate: "Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father;
but go to my brethren, and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your
Father, my God and your God. How did you not go up, Lord Jesus? How were you
absent, who had put your spirit in the hands of the Father? When, besides, can
you be absent, always in the Father, always with the Father? As you yourself
have said, "If I go down to hell, you are there; if I spread my wings
before the day to live at the end of the seas, even there it is your hand that
will lead me "(Ps. 138, 8-10). Likewise, how do you climb, being
constantly everywhere? You have descended, it is true, as Son of man, and
descended without leaving the Father. But you have come down for us, so that
our eyes and souls may see you, so that we may believe in you. It is also for
us that you have come up, that we may follow you in spirit, unable to see you
with our eyes. You ascended for the Apostles, to whom you said, "Who saw
me, saw also the Father" (Jn, XIV, 9). John has known where to look for
you: it is with the Father that he has sought you and found you; so he wrote,
"And the Word was with God" (I, 1). You ascended for Paul, who, not
satisfied with following you alone, also taught us how to follow you and where
we could find you: "If then," he says, "you are resurrected with
Christ, look for things from high, where is Christ sitting at the right hand of
God "(Col., III, 1). And so that we do not make the function of the eyes
rather than that of hearts, he added: "Taste the things above, not those
of the earth" (Ib., 2). Therefore, it is not on earth, nor on the earth,
nor on the flesh, that we must seek you, if we wish to find you; for "now
we know no more the Christ according to the flesh" (II Cor., V, 16). And
Stephen did not seek you on earth, who saw you standing at the right hand of
God (Acts vi. 55ff), while Mary, who was looking for you on earth, could not
touch you. Stephen has reached you because he has sought you in heaven. Stephen
in the midst of the Jews saw you well, but absent; Mary among the angels did
not see you present. But why could she not touch you? The Evangelist herself
told us that she saw you well, but did not know it was you. For one reads,
"She turned around and saw Jesus standing; and she did not know it was
Jesus. It is fitting that she could not touch him, having not been able to see
him: for to see is to touch. Thus the Gospel text emphasizes the differences
between Mary and Mary. This one goes to meet Jesus to see him, she turns back;
this one is saluted, this one takes again. After all, you read: "Jesus
said to her, Woman. One who does not believe is a woman, and still designated
by the quality of her sex according to the body; for the one who believes comes
"to the perfect man, to the measure of the finished age of Christ"
(Ephesians IV, 13); it no longer has its name of the century, the sex of its
body, the mobility of youth, the chatter of old age. So Jesus said, "Woman,
why are you crying? As if to say: it is not just tears that God claims, but
faith; the true tears is to recognize Christ. "Who are you looking for? He
said; for the Lord condemns complicated delays. But He has just added:
"Who": not that he doubts, He who seeks, but because she herself does
not know who she seeks: for it is not Christ that she seeks, since she thinks
it is removed. Christ is there, what's the use of looking for him? It is the
misunderstanding to look for it, not to recognize it when one sees it. As well she
saw Christ and took him for a gardener. It is indeed what you read: "She,
believing that it was the gardener, said to him: Lord, if it is you who took it
away, tell me where you put it, and I take. If his faith is hesitant, his word
does not go astray; if she took him for a gardener, she nevertheless treated
him as the Son of God; if she does not believe yet, yet she desires to believe:
for it is He who has taken away the body, having raised it up. So this woman's
mistake is forgivable. Evidently, she should not have doubted that the body of
Christ had been raised by the glory of the Resurrection; yet she wishes to be
instructed by Christ, and already, in her devotion, she promises faith: she
will remove it from the earth, and seek it at the right hand of God. As a
result of these words, she is no longer called a woman, but Mary: the first
word is common to the crowd, the other is special to a person who follows
Christ. And it is sent to the disciples, without yet being in full possession
of his faith, at least as a messenger. But he is forbidden to touch it, because
she had not yet learned with Paul that the fullness of the divinity dwells in
the body of Christ; she had not yet stripped away the uncertainty of the age,
the doubts of the flesh; she had not yet lived the life of Christ. So she does
not adore the Lord and does not take her feet, like the other Mary: in the
latter, it is not so much the bodily homage as the movement of a plenary faith
which translates she believes the Christ man and God together; for it is God we
worship, the man we hug. The Lord is not reluctant to be touched by a woman,
since Mary rubbed her feet with perfume. He does not refuse contact, but He
teaches progress: for all can not touch the risen Christ whom they touched
during his stay in this life and in this body. Whoever wishes to touch Christ
must mortify his limbs, and, as destined to resurrect, to put on the bowels of
mercy (Col., III, 12), to renounce the earthly without hesitation. What does it
mean to say, "Do not touch me? Do not put your hand to big things; but go
to my brothers, that is to say the most perfect? for "whoever does the
will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, my sister, and my
mother" (Matt. xii. 50)? because the Resurrection can be easily grasped
only by the perfect. The prerogative of this faith is reserved for the better
established; "As for women, I do not allow them to teach in the church;
let them ask their husbands at home "(I Tim., II, 12). She is therefore
sent to those of the house; and she accepted the orders that were given to her.
We do not ignore the feeling of some on this passage: Christ would not have
wanted to be touched, because he had not yet received the image he had given to
the Father, and that could not touch him yet. "I ascend to your Father, my
God and your God. He made about distinction, talking to a woman; for we have no
common nature with Christ except by his human condition. The Father is such for
Him by true generation, for us by free adoption; for Him by nature, for us by
grace. He is God for Him in the unity of the mystery, for us by his heavenly
power.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

will say: How, then, did Thomas, while he did not believe yet, yet touch
Christ? But it seems he doubted not of the Resurrection of the Lord, but of the
mode of the Resurrection. And he had to teach me by touching him, as Paul also
taught me: "For this corruption must put on incorruptibility, and this
mortal body must put on immortality. (I Cor., XV, 53), so that the unbeliever
believes, and the hesitant can not nail; because we believe more easily what we
see. Now Thomas had reason to be astonished, when he saw, everything being
closed, a body slipping through impenetrable barriers to the bodies, without
any damage to their structure. Yes, it is wonderful that a bodily nature has
passed through an impenetrable body: we do not see it happen, we see its
presence; he was easy to touch, difficult to recognize. The troubled disciples,
too, thought they saw a spirit. This is why the Lord, to show us the character
of the resurrection: "Touch," he said, "and see: a spirit has
neither flesh nor bone as you see that I have them. So it is not an incorporeal
nature, but the state of his resurrected body, which has made him penetrate
normally impenetrable fences; because what is touching is body, what is felt is
body. But it is bodily that we are resurrected: for "the seed is a body of
flesh, whence raises up a spiritual body" (I Cor., XV, 44); one is subtle,
the other gross, being further thickened by the conditions of his earthly
infirmity. How, indeed, had there not been a body, while the marks of wounds,
traces of scars, which the Lord presented to be touched, remained? By this He
not only strengthens the faith, but He excites the devotion: the wounds
received for us, He preferred to take them to heaven, He did not want to erase
them, to show God the Father the price of our liberation . It is in this state
that the Father places him on his right, welcoming the trophies of our
salvation; such are the witnesses that the crown of his wounds has produced for
us.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> And
since our discourse has reached this point, let us consider how it is done that
according to John the Apostles have believed, since they have rejoiced, that
according to Luke they are taken back as incredulous; that here they have
received the Holy Spirit, where they are commanded to dwell in the city until
they are clothed with this gift from heaven. It seems to me that one, as an
apostle, has touched the highest and the highest, the other the next, closer to
the human; one has followed the details of the story, the other has summarized.
For there can be no doubt of him who testifies of deeds to which he himself has
witnessed, "and his testimony is true" (Jn, XXI, 24); As for the
person who deserves to be an evangelist, it is also appropriate to remove from
him all suspicion of negligence or men-dreaming. Thus we think that both are
true: they are not separated by the difference of thought or the diversity of
people. For if Luke says at first that they did not believe, later on he shows
that they believed. If we consider the beginning, there is opposition; for the
continuation, the agreement is assured. Let us consider the very words of the
text. John says, "And the disciples rejoiced at the sight of the Lord. So
he said to them again, Peace with you! As the Father sent me, I too send you.
Having thus spoken, He blew on them and said to them: Receive the Holy Spirit;
those to whom you will forgive their sins, they will be forgiven them; and
those to whom you will retain them, they will be retained "(Jn, XX,
20-23). As for Luke, he said, "... and how they recognized him at the
breaking of the bread. But while they were speaking in this way, he found
himself in the midst of them and said to them, Peace to you! It's me, do not be
afraid. Troubled and frightened, they thought they saw a spirit. It might seem
that here they were more numerous. But as it is here on the evening of the
Resurrection (for the two who, at the break of day, had entered to abide with
the Lord, are shown to us, once he has suddenly stolen, returning to the hour
to the disciples), and, as according to John, it is late, on this day after the
Sabbath, that we see him appear to the disciples and present his wounds to
their touch, it seemed to us that, to avoid any uncertainty, there is had to
look more carefully. He seems indeed to have shown himself apart from the
Eleven, as he had already shown himself to Ammaon85 and Cleopas on the evening;
and like these two, the Eleven could also come together to strengthen others.
"They were troubled," as you read according to Luke, and that is why
"He opened their minds to understand what is written." But there is
no doubt that he has written longer, the other more succinctly. How, indeed,
would they say that only Peter saw it, if it had appeared to all? But just as
among the women He appeared only to Mary and to the other Mary Magdalene, as
well as to Peter's men at daybreak. And Paul says, "I taught you first
that Christ died according to the scriptures, and was buried and resurrected on
the third day according to the scriptures, and appeared in Cephas "(I Cor.,
XV, 3-5). This is why Mark explicitly shows us the young man instructing the
women to tell Peter and the disciples (Mk. Xvi. 7) that the Lord is risen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> Peter
therefore saw the Lord alone. It was because his devotion was always ready and
willing to believe; so he was busy collecting more clues for his faith.
Sometimes with John, sometimes alone, everywhere, however, he runs with zeal;
everywhere he is either alone or first. Not content to have seen, he returns to
look at what he has seen, and, inflamed with the desire to seek the Lord, he is
not satisfied to see him. He sees him alone, he sees him with the Eleven, he
sees him with the seventy. He still sees it when Thomas has believed. He sees
it when he was fishing; but not satisfied to have seen it, in the impatience of
his desire, neglecting his catch, forgetful of the danger (without however
forgetting the respect: as soon as he saw the Lord on the shore he took his
garment), it seemed to him Too long to arrive with others while sailing.
Likewise, when the Lord walked on the sea, he ran to meet him on the waves of
the sea, forgetting his nature; so when the Lord was arrested by the Jews, he
was the only one to draw the sword against the troop. Likewise, here again,
when the Lord stands on the shore, by a dangerous shortcut he hastened the
homage of his religion. There is no doubt that Peter believed, that he believed
because he loved, because he loved because he believed. So he is pained that he
is asked three times: "Do you love me? Because we question whoever we
doubt. But the Lord does not doubt: He questioned, not to learn, but to
instruct him that at the moment of ascending into heaven He left us on earth as
the representative of his love. For you read: "Simon son of John, do you
love me? ? Yes, you know, Lord, that I love you. And Jesus said, Feed my lambs.
Having a good conscience of himself, Peter testifies of a disposition which he
did not take for the circumstance, but which God knows for a long time. Which
other could easily affirm it of oneself? Also, being alone among all to declare
oneself, it is preferred to all: for charity is greater than all (cf I Cor.,
XIII, 13). We must also consider with great care why, the Lord having said to
him: "Do you love me? He replied, "You know, Lord, that I love you.
It seems to me here that to cherish involves the charity of the spirit, to
love, a kind of warmth engendered by the ardor of body and soul; and Peter
marks, in my opinion, that not only his spirit, but his very body, was of fire
for the service of God. As well the third time the Lord asked him, either,
"Do you love me? But: "Do you love me? And I command him to graze, no
more, as the first time, the lambs that must be fed with milk, nor, as the
second time, the young sheep, but the sheep, so that being more perfect it will
govern the most perfect. That is why being perfect in every way, no longer
being able to be thrilled by the flesh to the glory of passion, the crown is
awarded to him. "When you were young," he said, "you put on your
belt and went where you wanted; but when you become old, you will stretch out
your hands, and another will tie you to lead you where you do not want to go.
Good old age! the prolongation of life did not render her powerless to use
herself, but the maturity of virtue prepared her for martyrdom. It represses
the thrust of the passions of the body, does not yield to lusts, flees sweets,
does not covet beauty. "For the flesh covets against the spirit"
(Gal., V, 17), and finds, to go wherever it wills, the cross paths of various
pleasures; but the good old age of the soul chooses not that which is agreeable
to the body, but that which is useful to the soul, and does not allow itself to
be taken up with the capricious wills of the body, but is retained, as in spite
of itself, by a brake who masters it. So Peter, while being ready in his heart
to undergo martyrdom, yet, when danger has arisen, let the firmness of his soul
falter. For the use of the heavenly gift captivates us by its sweetness; who
would not choose martyrdom, if he could die at his pleasure? So Peter himself
seems not to want, but is preparing to conquer86. And what a marvel if Peter
will not, when the Lord says, "Father, if it be possible, remove this
chalice from me; however, it is not my will that is done, but yours
"(Matt. XXVI, 39). Finally, after the experience of his presumption,
Pierre no longer dares to promise the perseverance of his will, but, as if to
be supported, seeks the company of another.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> So
many testimonies of virtue lead us to believe that Pierre could not doubt. That
John also believed when he saw the Lord is evident, since he believed as soon
as he saw the empty tomb of his body. Why does Luke mention that they were
troubled? Above all, because the opinion of the greatest number includes the opinion
of some; and then, because even having believed in the Resurrection, Peter
could be troubled, seeing that the Lord in his body was suddenly entering a
closed place of locked doors and solid walls. Luke has therefore followed every
detail in the historical order; the other considered the final, this one the
suc-cession; for, saying, "Then He opened their minds to understand what
is written," he admits, well, too, that the disciples believed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As for the
Holy Spirit, or He blew it on the Eleven as being more perfect, and promised to
give it to others later - or it's the same as he blew it here, there promised.
And there does not seem to be a contradiction, since "the gifts are
divided: to one is given the word of wisdom, to the other the discourse of science
by virtue of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit. to another
the gift of healing, to another the variety of tongues "(I Cor., XII, 4,
8-10). So he has blown an activity here, somewhere else He promises another.
For there has been granted grace to forgive sins, which seems more sovereign
(Jn, xx, 23); and it is blown out by Christ, to make you believe that it is the
Spirit of Christ, and to believe that the Spirit comes from God; for God alone
forgives sins. As for Luke, he describes the outpouring of the gift of tongues.
As you read in this place: "Receive the Holy Spirit; those whose sins you
will forgive, they will be given to them ", while in the Acts of the
Apostles you read:" And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and
they began to speak various languages, according as the Spirit gave to speak
"(II, 4). As for the variety of appearances, it signifies the multitude of
angels who serve him, as the Lord himself had promised in these terms:
"And you will see the angels come down and ascend to the Son of man"
( Jn, I, 51).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And it
pleases God that with the end of the Gospel our speech also ends!</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> Why,
according to Matthew (XXVI, 32) and Mark (XIV, 28), he asks the disciples:
"I will precede you in Galilee: this is where you will see me"?
while, according to Luke and John, He also offered himself to their eyes in the
Cenacle? And even He was seen frequently, and "to more than five hundred
brethren" (I Cor., XV, 5-7), and to Peter and James, as the testimony of
the Apostle proves to us. And Luke taught us in the Acts of the Apostles that
he showed himself alive to the disciples "by appearing to them after his
Passion many times and talking about the Kingdom of God" (Act, I, 3 ). So,
if it has appeared frequently, and to many, if Scripture does not assign to its
appearance in Galilee any definite and definite moment, while it expresses and
the day and the hour when He showed himself Jerusalem, it would be that they
were fearful when He visited them in the Cenacle; stronger, they will meet on
the mountain. Finally John shows the disciples gathered in the Cenacle, closed
doors. for fear of the Jews; Luke wrote that they were not eleven, but more
numerous. As for Matthew, it was not enough that only the Eleven gathered in
Galilee; for at last you read: "And the eleven disciples went to Galilee
on the mountain where Jesus had appointed them, and at his sight they worshiped
him; yet some doubted "and He gave them the power to teach and to baptize.
Mark also writes that in the end He appeared to the eleven disciples at table;
and it is then that he entrusts them with the same charge of preaching all over
the world. Here is what seems to me more plausible: the Lord told the disciples
well that they would see him in Galilee; but as fear made them stay in the
Cenacle, He first appeared to them; later, their souls firmed, the Eleven
gained Galilee. Or ? I see that such is the preference of diligent writers?
nothing prevents us from saying that they were less numerous in the Cenacle,
more numerous on the mountain.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

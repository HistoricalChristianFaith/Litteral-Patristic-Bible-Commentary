<i>Now all the publicans and sinners used to draw near unto Him to hear Him.
And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and
eats with them. And He spoke this parable unto them, saying, What man of you
having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety
and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it.
And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he
has come home, he calls together his friends and his neighbours, saying unto
them, Rejoice with me: for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto
you, that likewise there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more
than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. Or what woman
having ten drachms, if she lose one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep
the house, and search diligently till she find it. And when she has found it,
she calls her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me: for
I have found the drachm which I had lost. Likewise I say unto you, that there
is joy before the angels of God over one sinner that repents.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">YOU
have no doubt attended here also to what has been read; you have wondered with
me at the Saviour's words: have you also understood it thoroughly and
spiritually, and fixed the searching eye of the mind upon its profounder
interpretation? Has the sense of what has been said been caught by you? Or
possibly has the word, after having rung in your hearing, flown away, and
nothing settled there that would be to your profit. But as I imagine, in that
you are believers, and love instruction, the Saviour illumines your
understanding. For He it is "Who reveals the deep things of darkness, and
puts the light of understanding in the hearts of those that love Him."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
two parables then that follow close upon one another depict to us an image of
the divine gentleness, being both of <a name="p496"><font color="#000000">|496</font></a> similar meaning,
and, so to say, at concord with one another. But the senseless Jew is openly
reproved, for refusing in every way to understand the great and profound
mystery of the Incarnation. From him it was completely hidden, that God the
Father sent the Son from heaven, not "to judge the world," as He
Himself declares, but that the world might be saved through Him. In what manner
then was it fitting for the world to be saved, which had been caught in the
meshes of sin, and proved guilty of the charge of wickedness, and that was
subject to a cruel tyrant, even Satan? Was it by demanding of it punishment,
for having fallen into transgression and sin? Or was it not rather by helping
it, in that God is long-suffering, and ready, so to speak, to cover over in
forgetfulness those things wherein man had transgressed, and to renew unto
holiness of life those who know not how to live uprightly?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Tell
me therefore, O Pharisee, why you murmur, because Christ disdained not to be
with publicans and sinners, but purposely provided for them this means of
salvation? To save men He yielded Himself to emptiness, and became in fashion
like unto us, and clothed Himself in human poverty. And do you then blame the
dispensation of the Only-begotten in the flesh? Do you find fault with His
humbling Himself from above in heaven, Who transcends all? Nay, leave you not
the very Incarnation without censure? And yet the holy prophets wondered at the
beautiful skill of the mystery. For the prophet David in the Psalms declares,
"Sing you with understanding: God has set a King over all the
nations." And the prophet Habakkuk says, "That he heard His hearing,
and was afraid: and that he considered also His doings, and was
astonished." How therefore are you not ashamed of blaming those things
which you ought to have admired? Would you have the Lord of all stern and
inexorable, or good rather and kind to men? The family upon earth had gone
astray: it had wandered from the hand of the chief shepherd: and therefore He
Who feeds the flocks above in heaven, became like unto us, that He might make
us also dwell in His folds:----that He might unite us to those who had never
gone astray, and drive from us the beast of prey, and ward off like some
impious band of robbers those impure demons, who had led astray all beneath the
sky. <a name="p497"><font color="#000000">|497</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
sought therefore that which was lost: and, to show that the Jewish
fault-finding on this account was vain, He says unto them, "What man of
you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the
ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go to seek that which is lost. And if it
chance to be found, he rejoices in it, He says, more than in those that went
not astray." Understand from this, my beloved, the wide extent of the
Saviour's kingdom, and the multitude past numbering of His subjects, and the
skilful plan of the dispensation towards us. For the sheep, He says, are a
hundred, so making the number of His subjects mount up to a multitude complete
and altogether perfect. For constantly, so to speak, a hundred is a perfect
number, being composed of ten times ten. And we have learnt also from the
divinely-inspired Scripture, that a "thousand thousands minister to God,
and ten thousand times ten thousand stand around His lofty throne." The
sheep therefore are a hundred: and of them one has gone astray, even the family
upon earth; which also the chief Shepherd of all sought, having left in the
wilderness those ninety and nine. Was it therefore because He had no regard for
the many, that mercy was shown to the one only? No! not because He had no
regard for them; that were impossible: but because they are in security,
guarded by His Almighty hand. It was right therefore that mercy should rather
be shown to that which was lost, that evidently nothing might be wanting to
that other multitude, but the one being restored thereto, the hundred might
regain its beauty.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
search therefore after that which was lost was no act of contempt towards those
who had not erred, but one of grace and mercy and love to mankind fit for the
supreme and transcendent nature to bestow on His fallen creatures.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
come, and let us examine the matter by the help also of another example, in
order that we may at all times defend the incomparable gentleness of Christ,
the Saviour of us all. For let it be supposed that in one house there are many
inmates, of <a name="p498"><font color="#000000">|498</font></a> whom it so chances that one falls ill. For
whom then are those skilled in healing summoned? Is it not for him only who has
fallen ill? But it is not through any disregard of the many, that those who
have been called in to heal attend only to him who is sick, and give him the
benefit of their skill, as the time and his need require. In like manner
therefore it was worthy, right worthy of God, Who rules over all, to stretch
out His saving hand to that which had gone astray. The wild beast had seized
it: it had led the family upon earth astray from the pasture, and had hurried
it into all misery. The chief Shepherd saved it: for He sought that which had
wandered, and has established for us a fold, unassailable and impregnable
against wild boasts and robbers, even the Church; in admiration of which we may
say, in the words of the prophet, "Behold, we have a strong and secure
city: He will place (for us) a wall and rampart."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
the sense of the parable which immediately follows is exactly similar, in
which, He says, that 'a woman who had ten drachms lost one of them, and having
lit a lamp and found it, rejoiced greatly therein, and made it a reason for
special joy.' By the former parable therefore, in which the wandering sheep
signified the family upon earth, we learnt, that we are the property of God
over all, in that He it is Who brought into existence those things which
previously had no existence. For "He made us, and not we ourselves,"
as it is written. And "He is our God, and we are the people of His
pasture, and the sheep of His hand." And by this second parable, in which
that which was lost is compared to a drachma, and that again as one out of ten,
that is of a perfect number, and of a sum complete in the reckoning;----for the
number ten also is perfect, being the close of the series from the unit
upwards;----it is clearly shown, that we are in the royal likeness and image,
even that of God over all. For the drachma is, I suppose, the denarius, on
which is stamped the royal likeness, <a name="p499"><font color="#000000">|499</font></a> That we then who had
fallen, and, so to speak, been lost, have been found by Christ, and transformed
by holiness and righteousness into His image, how can any one doubt, when the
blessed Paul has thus written, "But we all, with open face beholding as in
a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to
glory, as of the Lord the Spirit." And he sends to the Galatians also in
these words, "My children, of whom I am again in labour, until Christ is
formed in you."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">A
search then was made for that which had fallen, for which purpose the woman
lighted a lamp. For we were found, as I said, by the wisdom of God the Father,
Which is the Son, when the divine and intellectual light shone upon us, and the
sun arose, and "the day star ascended, and the day dawned," according
to the Scripture. For God also has somewhere said by one of the holy prophets
of Christ the Saviour of us all, "My righteousness quickly approaches, and
My mercy to be revealed, and My salvation shall burn as a lamp." And He
says of Himself, at one time, "I am the light of the world:" and
again at another, "I am come a light into this world: he that follows Me
shall not walk in darkness, but shall possess the light of life." By the
light therefore that which was lost is saved, and there was joy thereby to the
powers above. For they rejoice even in one sinner that repents, as He has
taught us Who knows all things. If they then keep festival over one who is
saved, in unison altogether with the divine purpose, and laud with
never-ceasing praises the Saviour's gentleness, with how great joy must they be
filled, when all beneath the heaven is saved, and called by faith in Christ to
the acknowledgment of the truth, having put off the pollutions of sin, and
loosed its neck from the bonds of death, and escaped from blame, even the blame
of its wandering and fall! For all these things we gain in Christ: by Whom, and
with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion with, the Holy Spirit, for
ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p500"><font color="#000000">|500</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And He said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his
father, Father, give me the portion of your goods that comes to me. And he
divided unto them his substance. And not many days after, the younger son
gathered every thing together, and journeyed into a far country, and there
scattered his goods by riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a
mighty famine in that land, and he began to be in want. And he went and joined
himself to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed
swine. And he desired to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were
eating: and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself he said, How many
hired servants of my father have bread in abundance, and 1 perish here with
hunger. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and before you, and am no more 'worthy to be called your
son: make me as one of your hired servants. And he arose and went to his
father. And while He was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and his
bowels yearned, and he ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And his son
said unto him, My father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and am
no more worthy to be called your son. But his father said to his servants,
Bring forth quickly the chief robe, and clothe him: and put a ring on his hand,
and shoes on his feet. And bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and we will eat,
and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive: and was lost, and is
found. And they began to be merry.</i>----<i>Now his elder son was in the field,
and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard the sound of music and
rejoicing. And he called one of the servants, and asked him what these things
meant. And he said unto him, Your brother is come, and your father has killed
the fatted calf, because he has received him sound. And he was angry, and would
not go in: therefore came his father out, and besought him. But</i> <a name="p501"><font color="#000000">|501</font></a> <i>he answered and said to his father, Lo! all these years
do I serve you, and never have transgressed your commandment, and you never
gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But when this your son,
who has, eaten up your wealth with harlots, is come, you have killed for him
the fatted calf. And he said unto him, My son, you are ever with me: and all
that is mine is yours. But it was fitting to make merry and be glad: for this
your brother was dead, and is alive: and was lost, and is found.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">I
HEAR one of the holy prophets trying to win unto repentance those who are far
from God, and saying, "Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God: for you
have become weak in your iniquity. Take with you words, and return to the Lord
our God." What sort of words then did he, under the influence of the
Spirit, command them to take with them? Or were they not such as become those
who wish to repent; such namely, as would appease God, Who is gentle, and loves
mercy. For He even said by one of the holy prophets, "Return you returning
children, and I will heal your breaches." And yet again by the voice of
Ezekiel, "Return you altogether from your wickednesses, O house of Israel.
Cast away from you all your iniquities which you have committed, that they be
not to you for a punishment of iniquity. For I have no pleasure in the death of
the sinner, as that he should turn from his evil way and live." And the
same truth Christ here also teaches us, by this most beautifully composed
parable, which I will now to the best of my ability endeavour to discuss,
briefly gathering up its broad statements, and explaining and defending the
ideas which it contains.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
is the opinion then of some, that by the two sons are signified the holy
angels, and we the dwellers upon earth: and that the elder one, who lived
soberly, represents the company of the holy angels, while the younger and
profligate son is the human race. And there are some among us who give it a
different explanation, arguing that by the elder and well conducted son is
signified Israel after the flesh: while by the other, whose choice it was to
live in the lust of pleasures, and who removed far from his father, is depicted
the company of <a name="p502"><font color="#000000">|502</font></a> the Gentiles. With these explanations I do
not agree: but I would have him who loves instruction, search after that which
is true and unobjectionable. What then I say is as follows, "giving
occasions to the wise, and to the just offering knowledge," as Scripture
commands: for they will examine for a fitting meaning the explanations proposed
to them. If then we refer the upright son to the person of the holy angels, we
do not find him speaking such words as become them, nor sharing their feelings
towards repentant sinners, who turn from an impure life to that conduct which
is worthy of admiration. For the Saviour of all and Lord says, that "there
is joy in heaven before the holy angels over one sinner that repents." But
the son, who is described to us in the present parable as being acceptable unto
his father, and leading a blameless life, is represented as being angry, and as
even having proceeded so far in his unloving sentiments as to find fault with
his father for his natural affection for him who was saved. "For he would
not, it says, go into the house," being vexed at the reception of the
penitent almost before he had come to his senses, and because there had even
been slain the calf in his honour, and his father had made for him a feast. But
this, as I said, is at variance with the feelings of the holy angels: for they
rejoice and praise God when they see the inhabitants of the earth being saved.
For so when the Son submitted to be born in the flesh of a woman at Bethlehem,
they carried the joyful news to the shepherds, saying, "Fear you not: for
behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy that shall be to all the people,
that there is born to you today in the city of David a Saviour Who is Christ
the Lord." And crowning with lauds and praises Him Who was born, they
said, "Glory to God in the highest, and upon earth peace, and among men
good-will."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
if any one say, that Israel according to the flesh is meant by the virtuous and
sober son, we are again prevented from assenting to this opinion by the fact,
that in no way whatsoever is it fitting to say of Israel that he chose a
blameless life. For throughout the whole of the inspired Scripture, so to say,
we may see them accused of being rebels and disobedient. For they were told by
the voice of Jeremiah, "What fault have your fathers found in Me, that
they have <a name="p503"><font color="#000000">|503</font></a> wandered far from Me, and have gone after
vanities, and become vain?" And in similar terms God somewhere spoke by
the voice of Isaiah, "This people draws near unto Me; with their lips they
honour Me, but their heart is very far from Me: but in vain do they fear Me,
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." And how then can any one
apply to those who are thus blamed the words used in the parable of the
virtuous and sober son? For he said, "Lo! all these years do I serve you,
and never have I transgressed your commandment." But they would not have
been blamed for their mode of life, had it not been that transgressing the
divine commandments, they betook themselves to a careless and polluted mode of
life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
yet again,----for I think it right to mention this also,----some would refer to
the person of our Saviour that fatted calf which the father killed when his son
was called unto conversion. But how then could the virtuous son, who is
described as wise and prudent, and constant in his duty, and whom some even
refer to the person of the holy angels, treat it as a reason for anger and
vexation that the calf was slain? For one can find no proof of the powers above
being grieved when Christ endured death in the flesh, and, so to speak, was
slain in our behalf. Rather they rejoiced, as I said, in seeing the world saved
by His holy blood. And what reason too had the virtuous son for saying
"you never gave me a kid." For what blessing is wanting to the holy
angels, inasmuch as the Lord of all has bestowed upon them with bounteous hand
a plentiful supply of spiritual gifts? Or of what sacrifice stood they in need
as regards their own state? For there was no necessity for the Emmanuel to
suffer also in their behalf. But if any one imagine, as I have already said
before, that the carnal Israel is meant by the virtuous and sober son, how can
he say with truth "you never gave me a kid?" For whether we call it
calf or kid, Christ is to be understood as the sacrifice offered for sin. But
He was sacrificed, not for the Gentiles only, but that He might also redeem
Israel, who by reason of his frequent transgression of the law had brought upon
<a name="p504"><font color="#000000">|504</font></a> himself great blame. And the wise Paul bears witness to
this, saying, "For this reason Jesus also, that He might sanctify the
people by His blood, suffered outside the gate."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">What
then is the object of the parable? Let us examine the occasion which led to it;
for so we shall learn the truth. The blessed Luke therefore had himself said a
little before of Christ the Saviour of us all, "And all the publicans and
sinners drew near unto Him to hear Him. And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured
saying, This man receives sinners and eats " with them." As therefore
the Pharisees and Scribes made this outcry at His gentleness and love to man,
and wickedly and impiously blamed Him for receiving and teaching men whose
lives were impure, Christ very necessarily set before them the present parable,
to show them clearly this very thing, that the God of all requires even him who
is thoroughly steadfast, and firm, and who knows how to live holily, and has
attained to the highest praise for sobriety of conduct, to be earnest in
following His will, so that when any are called unto repentance, even if they
be men highly blameable, he must rejoice rather, and not give way to an
unloving vexation on their account.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
we also sometimes experience something of this sort. For some there are who
live a perfectly honourable and consistent life, practising every kind of
virtuous action, and abstaining from every thing disapproved by the law of God,
and crowning themselves with perfect praises in the sight of God and of men:
while another is perhaps weak and trodden down, and humbled unto every kind of
wickedness, guilty of base deeds, loving impurity, given to covetousness, and
stained with all evil. And yet such a one often in old age turns unto God, and
asks the forgiveness of his former offences: he prays for mercy, and putting
away from him his readiness to fall into sin, sets his affection on virtuous
deeds. Or even perhaps when about to close his mortal life, he is admitted to
divine baptism, and puts away his offences, God being merciful unto him. And
perhaps sometimes persons are indignant at <a name="p505"><font color="#000000">|505</font></a> this, and even
say, 'This man, who has been guilty of such and such actions, and has spoken
such and such words, has not paid unto the judge the retribution of his
conduct, but has been counted worthy of a grace thus noble and admirable: he
has been inscribed among the sons of God, and honoured with the glory of the
saints.' Such complaints men sometimes give utterance too from an empty
narrowness of mind, not conforming to the purpose of the universal Father. For
He greatly rejoices when He sees those who were lost obtaining salvation, and
raises them up again to that which they were in the beginning, giving them the
dress of freedom, and adorning them with the chief robe, and putting a ring
upon their hand, even the orderly behaviour which is pleasing to God and
suitable to the free.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
is our duty, therefore, to conform ourselves to that which God wills: for He
heals those who are sick; He raises those who are fallen; He gives a helping
hand to those who have stumbled; He brings back him who has wandered; He forms
anew unto a praiseworthy and blameless life those who were wallowing in the
mire of sin; He seeks those who were lost; He raises as from the dead those who
had suffered the spiritual death. Let us also rejoice: let us, in company with
the holy angels, praise Him as being good, and loving unto men; as gentle, and
not remembering evil. For if such is our state of mind, Christ will receive us,
by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion with the Holy
Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p506"><font color="#000000">|506</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

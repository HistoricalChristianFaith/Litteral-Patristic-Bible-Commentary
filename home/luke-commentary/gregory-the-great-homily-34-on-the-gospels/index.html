Grégoire was condemned all summer to silence by his state of health. So his
speech is lengthening today. He begins by commenting on the parables of the
sheep and the drachma lost and found again, read on this liturgical day, before
embarking on a long digression on the angels, which is probably inspired by the
feast of St. Michael. . Homily ends with an exhortation to vigilance and
penance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I- (1-6) The
Pharisees are angry with the goodness of Christ for sinners. To heal their
pride, Jesus tells them a parable: the Creator leaves his ninety-nine sheep in
the desert (the angels in Heaven) to seek and bring back the lost one (the
fallen man). The Pope explains why there is more joy in Heaven for the sinner
who repents than for a righteous man who has never fallen: the penitent is
excited to zeal by the memory of his sins to expiate; the righteous, he risks
falling into a false security. The ideal would be to be both fair and penitent.
The opinion expressed here by our orator is a commonplace of monastic
literature: Cassian, for example, also affirms that it is much easier to bring
a sinner to conversion than to bring out of his lukewarmness the monk. who has
not entered resolutely into the ways of perfection and let the fire of his
first fervor fade away in him "(Conferences 4, 19). From the lost and
found sheep, Gregory passes to the drachma, whose meaning is the same. Nine
drachms remain with the woman of the parable, since there are nine choirs of
angels: clever transition, which allows the preacher to approach his second
subject.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">II- (7-14)
While pretending to lose the thread of his speech, the Holy Pope gives us in
fact a real little treatise of angelology. He shows how Scripture distinguishes
nine choirs of angels, what the names of these choruses signify, and what moral
lesson to draw from them. He discusses an opinion of an author who is said to
be Dionysius the Areopagite.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

(15-18) Returning to the man and his weaknesses, the speaker commits his
listeners to take care not to fall if they are standing, and to rise quickly by
penance if they have fallen . On what he undertakes to define the components of
a real penance, an opportunity for him to resume his initial theme: the praise
of the mercy of God, this mercy that manifested itself in a striking way on the

tongue has remained silent that my charity has stopped burning. Each one of you
can see for yourself what I am saying here: it often happens that the embarrassment
of external occupations comes to prevent the effect of charity, which, while
continuing to burn without diminution in our heart, does not allow however,
more to see in our works, just like the sun hidden by the clouds, which one
does not see on the earth and which continues nevertheless to shine in the sky.
This is how our charity can be hindered: it continues to feel the ardor of its

have learned, my brethren, through the reading of the gospel, that sinners and
publicans have come to our Redeemer, and that he admits them not only to
converse with him, but also to share his meal. At this sight, the Pharisees
were indignant. You can conclude that true justice is full of compassion, the
false full of indignation. This does not mean that the righteous can not also
be rightly indignant against sinners. But one thing is to act out of pride and
arrogance, another to be moved by zeal for the moral law. The just are
indignant indeed, but as if they were not indignant; they despair of sinners,
but as if they did not despair; they take them to task, but out of love; for
even if they multiply reproaches out of concern for morality, they nevertheless
preserve sweetness for charity. In their hearts, they usually feel inferior to
those they correct, and even those they judge, they consider them better than
them. In so doing, they watch over both their flock by the moral law and over
themselves by humility.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

on the contrary, that a false opinion of their justice makes them swell with
pride, despise all others and do not show any mercy or condescension for the
weak, and they become all the more sinners that they imagine they do not not

for the reception he had reserved for sinners, they blamed the very source of
mercy with a withered heart.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

because they were sick to the point of knowing nothing about it, the Heavenly
Physician, wishing to bring them back to a proper knowledge of themselves,
undertakes to cure them by gentle remedies. He offers them a parable full of
good nature and compresses in their heart the tumor of the abscess that hurts
them. He said to them, "Which of you, if he has a hundred sheep and comes
to lose one, leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness to go after the one that
is is lost? "See how Truth, in its goodness, knows how to provide everything
while giving us such a comparison: man can recognize in itself the merits,
although it concerns more especially the Creator of men himself. even. Since a
hundred is the number of perfection, God had a hundred sheep when He created
the nature of angels and men. But a sheep was lost when the man, when sinning,
left the pasture of life. The Creator then left the ninety-nine sheep in the
desert, for he abandoned the very high choirs of the angels in Heaven.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But why is
heaven called desert, if not because desert means "abandoned"? It was
when the man sinned that he gave up Heaven. Ninety-nine sheep dwelt in the
desert, while the Lord sought only one on the earth: the rational creatures,
angels and men, all of whom had been created to contemplate God, indeed saw
their number diminished by the loss. of man, and the Lord, wishing to restore
to Heaven the complete number of his sheep, sought on earth the man who had
lost himself. For where our evangelist says "in the desert", another
evangelist says "in the mountains" (Mt 18:12), to mean "in the
heights", since the sheep that had not perished stood in the heights of
the Sky.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to the celestial kingdom. There, he finds his friends and neighbors, that is to
say, the choirs of angels, who are his friends, because now fixed [in God],
they keep his will and his neighbors, because they enjoy the brilliance of his
vision. It should also be noted that he does not say: "Rejoice with the
sheep that I found", but: "Rejoice with me", because our life is
all its joy, and our return to Heaven brings to their plenitude its solemn
rejoicings.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"Thus, I say to you, there will be more joy in Heaven for one sinner who
repents than for ninety-nine just men who need not repent. Here we should
examine, my brethren, why the Lord declares that there is more joy in Heaven
for the conversion of sinners than for the perseverance of the righteous; but
the daily example of what we have before our eyes teaches us: often, those who
do not feel guilty of great sins remain well in the path of justice, and they
do not commit any action forbidden, but they do not Nor do they feel much ardor
for the heavenly homeland, and they deprive themselves all the less of the
things permitted that they do not remember to have committed their defenses.
Thus they often remain lazy in the practice of good basic works, feeling safe
in the fact that they have never sinned really badly.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">On the
contrary, some of those who remember to have performed forbidden actions, being
pierced with compunction by their very grief, are inflamed with love for God
and exert themselves to great virtues; they undertake all the difficult
struggles of holiness, they abandon all the goods of the world, flee honors,
rejoice in the outrages received, burn with desire [for eternal life] and yearn
for the heavenly homeland. And considering that they had departed from God,
they redeemed their losses from the past by the profits they make in the course
of their lives.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">There is
therefore more joy in Heaven for the conversion of a sinner than for the
perseverance of a righteous man, just as a leader prefers in battle the soldier
who, having returned after fleeing, enemy with vigor, to one who has never
turned his heels in front of the enemy, but has never really fought with
courage. Thus, the peasant prefers the land which, after the thorns, bears
abundant fruit, to that which has never had thorns, but never produces a rich
harvest either.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. However,
it is necessary to know that there are many righteous ones whose life is such a
joy [for Heaven] that it does not yield in any way to the penitent life of the
sinners. For there are many who, although they are not aware of any bad action,
show a pain as great as if they were charged with all sins. They refuse all
things, even those which God authorizes; they surround themselves with a
sovereign contempt for the world, forbid themselves absolutely everything,
deprive themselves even of licit goods, turn away from the visible and ignite
for the invisible; they put their joy in lamentation and humble themselves in
everything; others mourn the sins of their actions, but they mourn the sins of
their thought. So what about these men, except that they are both just and
penitent, since they humble themselves in penance for the sins of their
thought, without ever ceasing to persevere in righteousness by their works? We
must therefore recognize what an immense joy a righteous person must give to
God by the tears of his humility, when a sinner already involved in Heaven so
great by punishing himself, by penance, for what he has done wrong. .</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. The
text continues: "Or, what woman, if she has ten drachmas and comes to lose
one, does not light a lamp, does not put her house upside down and does not
look carefully until she find the lost coin? "It is one and the same
person that the pastor and the woman symbolize, for it is one and the same
person who is God and Wisdom of God. And as the drachmas are struck by an image,
the woman lost her drachma when the man, who had been created in the image of
God, sinned, removed from the resemblance he had with his Creator. But the
woman lit her lamp, because the wisdom of God was manifested in a human nature.
The lamp is indeed a light in a terracotta vase; but what is a light in a
terracotta vase, if not the divinity in the flesh? It is from this earthenware
vase, that is to say from its body, that the Wisdom in person affirms: "My
strength has withered like a terra-cotta vase" (Ps 22:16). Since the
terra-cotta hardens in the fire, his strength dried up like a clay vase: the
flesh he had assumed was hardened by the torments of his Passion for the glory
of his Resurrection.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The woman,
having lighted her lamp, put her house upside down: as soon as the deity of
Wisdom shone through her flesh, all our conscience was shaken. Because the
house is turned upside down when the consciousness of the man is troubled at
the sight of his faults. The phrase "put upside down" does not differ
much from the verb "to clean up" which is read in its place in other
manuscripts; indeed, a misguided spirit can be cleansed of its inveterate vices
only if we start by turning it upside down with fear. So once she has set the
house upside down that the woman finds the drachma, since it is by the deep
shaking of his conscience that man is restored to the likeness of his Creator.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And
when she found it, she assembled her friends and her neighbors, and said to
them, 'Rejoice with me, for I found her, the drachma I had lost!'" Who are
friends and neighbors if not the powers of heaven of which I spoke above? They
are so much nearer to heavenly wisdom, that the grace of continual
contemplation brings them closer to them. Let us not fail here to ask why this
woman who figures the Wisdom of God is shown to us in possession of ten
drachmas, and why she loses one and finds it after seeking it. The Lord created
the nature of angels and men to know Him, and because He wanted them to be eternal,
He certainly created them in His likeness. Thus, this woman had ten drachmas,
because there are nine choirs of the angels, but in order to complete the
number of the elect, the man was created as a tenth, and after his fault, this
one did not perish far from his Creator: the eternal Wisdom, which shone in the
flesh by his miracles, saved him by means of the light [of his divinity] lit in
a vase of terra cotta.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. We said
that there are nine orders of angels. We know from the testimony of Holy
Scripture that there are Angels, Archangels, Virtues, Powers, Principalities,
Dominations, Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim. That there are Angels and
Archangels, almost all the pages of Holy Scripture attest; as for the Cherubim
and the Seraphim, everyone knows that the books of the prophets often speak
about it. The Apostle Paul enumerates for the Ephesians the names of four other
orders when he says: "Above all Principality, Power, Virtue, and
Domination." (Eph 1:21). He says again, in writing to the Colossians,
"Both the Thrones and the Powers, the Principalities, and the
Dominations." (Col 1:16). Addressing the Ephesians, he had already quoted
Dominations, Principalities, and Powers; but before speaking to the Colossians,
he puts the thrones before them, of which he had said nothing to the Ephesians.
If, then, the Thrones are joined to the four orders which Paul quotes to the
Ephesians - Principalities, Powers, Virtues, Dominations - five orders are thus
mentioned by name; and if we add to it the Angels and the Archangels, the
Cherubim and the Seraphim, we find without any doubt that there are nine orders
of angels.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This is
why the prophet asserts to the first angel who was created, "You have been
the seal of likeness, full of wisdom and perfect beauty in the delights of
God's paradise." (Ez 28: 12-13). It must be noted here that he does not
say it created in the likeness of God, but seal of its likeness, in order to
make it clear that its nature is marked by a more exact likeness to the image
of God, because she is of a more complete perfection. The same text continues
immediately: "Your garment is all covered with precious stones: sardoine,
topaz and jasper, chrysolite, onyx and beryl, sapphire, carbuncle and
emerald." These are nine names of precious stones that are listed, since
the orders of There are nine angels. The first angel appears to us adorned and
covered with these nine orders of angels, because having the preeminence over
all the angelic militia, it seems even more brilliant of glory if one compares
it with the others.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. But why
have enumerated these different choirs of the angels, remaining in heaven, if
we do not explain their ministries in detail? The word Angel means in Greek
"Announcer", and Archangel, "Great Annunciator". We must
also know that the term Angel means a function, and not a nature. For if the
blessed spirits of the heavenly homeland are always spirits, they can not
always be called angels; they are Angels only when they announce something.
This is why the psalmist says, "Spirits, he makes his angels." (Ps
104, 4). It is as if he clearly said: "He who always has minds at his
disposal, he makes his angels when he wants." Angels are called those who announce
things of lesser importance, Archangels those who announce the most high. This
is why it was not an Angel, but the Archangel Gabriel whom God sent to the
Virgin Mary (Lk 1, 26). In such a ministry, indeed, it was fitting that the
greatest of the angels should come and announce the greatest news.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Some of
these Angels also receive particular names, to express in words the extent of
their action. For it is not in the holy city, where the vision of Almighty God
confers a perfect knowledge, that they are given a proper name: there is no
need of a name to know their persons; but it is when they come to perform to us
any service that they derive a particular name from that ministry.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">9. This is
how Michel means "who is like God?" Gabriel, "Strength of
God"; Raphael, "Medicine of God". Whenever extraordinary power
is needed, the Scripture tells us that it is Michael who is sent: his action
and his name make it clear that no one can boast of doing what is reserved for
the sole power of God. The ancient enemy, devoured by the proud desire to equal
himself to God, declared: "I will ascend to heaven, I will raise my throne
above the stars of heaven, I will sit on the mountain of the covenant beside
the Aquilon I will ascend to the top of the clouds and be like the Most High
"(Is 14: 13-14). But the Scripture testifies that at the end of the world,
abandoned to his own strength and condemned to perish in the final torture, he
will fight against Archangel Michael: "It was done, says John, a fight
with the Archangel Michael "(Rev 12: 7). In his pride, the devil had
exalted himself to make himself the equal of God; but it must be defeated by
Michael, he learns that no one should rise by pride to the likeness of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">To Mary,
it is Gabriel who is sent, whose name means "Force of God". Would not
he come to announce the one who deigned to appear in humility to fight the
powers of the air? The psalmist says about him: "Princes, break your
doors; lift up, eternal doors, and the King of glory will come in. Who is this
King of glory? He is the strong and mighty Lord, the mighty Lord in battle.
"And again:" The Lord of hosts, behold the King of glory "(Psalm
24: 7-10). It was thus necessary that it was by "Strength of God"
that the Lord of the Armies, powerful in the fight, was announced who came to
make war with the powers of the air.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Finally,
as we have said, Raphael means "Medicine of God". In fact, this
Archangel has dispelled the darkness that made Tobias blind, touching his eyes,
so to speak, through the care lavished on him (see Tb 11: 7-8). He who was sent
to heal was therefore worthy to be called "Medicine of God".</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Since we
have given a few words of explanation on the names of the angels, we now have
to comment briefly on the terms used to designate their functions.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">10. By Virtues,
we designate the spirits by which signs and miracles are most often performed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">By the
powers, we designate those who have received, in their order, more power than
others to submit the adverse forces to their authority, limit their power and
thus prevent them from tempting the hearts of men as much as they do. want.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">By the
Principalities, we designate those who command the other good angelic spirits
themselves, who distribute to those who are subject to them the orders of all
that they must do, and who direct them in the accomplishment of the divine
missions.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">By
Dominations, we designate spirits that far exceed the power of the
Principalities. For to have the principality consists in holding the first rank
in a group, while to dominate is also to have each other under his authority.
Dominations, therefore, are called the angels' troops, who, by their admirable
power, have precedence over others, because they are bound to submit to them by
obedience.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">By the
Thrones, we designate the militia that always presides the almighty God to
exercise justice [sitting in front of them]. Since [the Greek word] throne
means "seat" in Latin, Thrones of God are called spirits who are
filled with divine grace with such abundance that the Lord sits in them and
uses them to pronounce his judgments. This is why the psalmist says: "You
are seated on a throne, O you who judge with equity." (Ps 9, 5)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Cherub
means "fullness of science". The higher troops are called Cherubim,
for they are spirits so much the more perfectly filled with the knowledge of
God, that they contemplate his glory more closely; to their measure of
creatures, they have a knowledge of all things all the more complete as they
come closer to the vision of their Creator, by virtue of their dignity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Finally,
Seraphim are called the militia of holy spirits who burn with incomparable love
because of their singular proximity to their Creator. Seraphim means
"burning and burning". They are so united to God that no other spirit
stands between them and him. They are so much more excited that they see it
more closely. The flame with which they burn is assuredly that of love, for
their love is all the more ardent as they contemplate the glory of divinity
with a more penetrating look.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">11. But
what good is it to say these few words about the angelic spirits, if we do not
bother to turn them to our progress by an adequate reflection? The heavenly
city is made up of angels and men, and we believe that there will be as many
representatives of the human race as there have remained of the chosen angels,
as it is written, "He has set the limits peoples according to the number
of angels of God "(Dt 32,8). We must therefore profit for our lives from
the distinctions that exist between the inhabitants of the city from above, in
order to inflame ourselves with a holy ardor to grow in virtue. For if it is
true that the number of men destined to ascend to Heaven is equal to that of
the angels who have remained there, those same men who return to the heavenly
homeland must imitate in something the militia they join. there. The different
ways of life of men correspond, indeed, to each of the orders of the heavenly
militia, and we receive a place in their ranks according to the similarity of
our way of living with theirs.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">There are
many who understand only humble truths, but continue to announce them to their
brothers with kindness: such men run to join the troop of Angels.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Others,

Archangels?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Still

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">There are

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Others
dominate so well in them all vices and desires, that their purity entitles them
to be called gods among men, as the Lord said to Moses: "See, I have made
you the god of Pharaoh "(Ex 7: 1): to which militia do they join, if not
to that of the Dominations?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Still
others take vigilant care to dominate themselves and an attention always awake
to examine themselves: never departing from the fear of God, they obtain as a
reward for their virtues the power to judge others equally well. . The Lord,
holding at the disposal of their mind the contemplation of his divinity,
presides in them as of his throne, and he examines through them the acts of
others, regulating all things with an admirable order from the height of his
seat. What are such men, if not the Thrones of their Creator? And where to
inscribe them, if not to the number of celestial seats? And since it is through
them that the holy Church is governed, even the elect are usually judged by
them for their acts of weakness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Some are

If indeed, as we have already stated, Cherubim means "fullness of

fulness of the Law" (Rom 13:10) All men who love God and their neighbor
with a plenitude beyond that of others deserve to be included in the number of
Cherubim.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Finally,
there are those who are inflamed by the contemplation of things from above and
yearn for their desire to their Creator; they desire nothing in this world,
they feed on the only love of eternity, reject all earthly goods, rise through
the spirit above all that passes; they love and burn, and they take their rest
in this very burn; they burn with love, they kindle others by speaking to them,
and at once they burn with God's love those whom they touch by their words.
What about such men, except that they are Seraphim? Their hearts, changed into
fire, illuminate and burn, since while turning the eyes of souls towards the
lights above, they purify them of the rust of their vices by making them cry of
compunction. Yes, those whom the love of their Creator ignites to this point
have received a vocation to take their place among the Seraphim.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">12. But
while I tell you all this, dear brothers, make a return on yourself and judge
what your merits and your hidden thoughts are worth. Examine whether you can
already avail yourself of any good you have done. Examine again if, as you are
called, you find your place among the militias we have mentioned quickly. Woe
to the soul that does not recognize in it any of the goods we have listed!
Worse still, if, thus, deprived of gifts [of grace], she does not deplore it!
How sad must it be, my brothers, the state of such a man, since he himself does
not regret it!</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Let us,
then, measure the rewards received by the elect, and aspire with all our
strength to grow in the love of so high a destiny. If we do not see the least
gift of grace in us, let's deplore it. And if we acknowledge ourselves to be
endowed with gifts of lesser value, let us not forget the larger gifts that
others have received, for even the heavenly hierarchies of blessed spirits have
been created so that some have pre-eminence over them. other.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Dionysius
the Areopagite, an ancient and venerable father, asserts, it is reported, that
it is the angels belonging to the inferior militia who are sent abroad, in a
visible or invisible manner, to accomplish their ministry; indeed, it is the
Angels or the Archangels who come to comfort men. The higher militias, however,
never depart from the innermost regions [of Heaven] because, because of their
pre-eminence, they are exempt from any external ministry. Such an assertion
seems to be contradicted by the words of Isaiah: "And one of the Seraphim
flew toward me, holding in his hand a burning stone which he had taken on the
altar with tweezers, and he touched my mouth "(Is 6, 6-7). But this word
of the prophet must be understood in the sense that the spirits sent on mission
take the name of those whose functions they fulfill. Seraphim - which means
"flame" - is called the angel who carries the burning coal taken to
the altar to deliver the sins of the tongue to the flames. It is not
unreasonable to see a confirmation of this opinion in what Daniel says:
"Thousands served him, and ten thousand hundreds of thousands stood before
him" (Dn 7:10). It is not the same thing to serve God and to stand before
him: those who serve him are those who come out to announce messages to us,
while those who stand in front of him, are those who enjoy of inner contemplation,
so that they are never sent on mission abroad.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">13. But
since we have learned, through various texts of Sacred Scripture, that certain
actions are performed by Cherubim and others by Seraphim, must we understand
that they do these things by themselves, or that they realize them through the
angels to whom they command, so that the latter, coming from their superiors,
share, according to what Dionys says, the names of these superiors? For our
part, we do not want to affirm what we can not prove by clear and unmistakable
texts. We do know, however, that in order to fulfill a ministry from above,
some spirits send others, as the prophet Zechariah testifies: "And,
behold, the angel that spoke in me went out, and behold, Another angel went out
to meet him and said to him, "Run and speak to this young man and say to
him, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls." (Zec 2: 7-8). From the
moment that an angel can say to another angel: "Run and speak," there
is no doubt that one sends the other. It is the lower ones who are sent, and
the superiors who send. But as for the angels who are sent, we also take for
granted that even when they come to us, they fulfill their external ministry
without, however, ever leaving the contemplation of God. Thus, while being
sent, they stand before God, for even if an angelic spirit is limited, the
supreme Spirit of God is not limited. This is why angels can be simultaneously
in mission and before him: wherever they are sent, when they go there, it is
still within God that they run.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">14. It
must be known, moreover, that the orders of blessed spirits often receive the
name of a neighboring order. The thrones, seats of God, are, as we have said, a
special order of blessed spirits, and the psalmist says, "You who seat on
the cherubim, appear" (Ps 80: 2). The Cherubim being in fact all neighbors
of the Thrones in the hierarchy of militias, this proximity makes the psalmist
say that the Lord also sits on the Cherubim. Thus certain goods are attributed
in the celestial city to one or the other without ceasing to be common to all.
And that which each one receives a participation is possessed entirely by the
spirits of another order.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">All,
however, are not designated by one and the same name: the order which has been
specifically charged with such a mission must also receive the name which
designates it. We have said that Seraphim means "flame", while all
burn with the love of the Creator; and Cherubim means "fullness of
knowledge," though no one can ignore anything where all see God, the
source of all science. The Thrones are so named because they are the militias
on which the Creator presides, but who can be blessed if the Creator does not
preside over his spirit? The particular names attributed to the various spirits
thus reflect qualities which all possess in part, but some of which have
received a more full participation. And even if up there some spirits hold
something that others can not dispose of - as is the case for Dominations and
Principalities, which are called by a specific name - in this place all things
belong to each, since by the charity of the Holy Spirit, all that is possessed
by one is also possessed by others.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">15. But
our research on the secrets of the citizens of Heaven has led us into a long
digression, which has made us lose the thread of our commentary. So let's
aspire to join the ones we just talked about, but let's get back to ourselves.
We must indeed remind ourselves that we are flesh. Let us keep silent for the
moment on the secrets of Heaven, but let us erase from the eyes of our Creator,
by means of penance, the stains with which our dust has soiled us. This is what
Divine Providence has promised us: "There will be joy in Heaven for one
sinner who repents." The Lord says no less by the mouth of the prophet: "If
the just one day to sin, I will not remember any more of all his good deeds.
"(Ezek 18, 24). Let us measure, if we can, as the goodness of God disposes
all with wisdom. He threatens to punish those who are standing, in case they
come to fall; but he promises mercy to those who have sinned, so that they
desire to rise again. It scares some, so that they are not too sure in their
good deeds; He gives courage to others so that they do not despair because of
their bad deeds. Are you right? Fear anger, for fear of falling. Are you a
sinner? Trust in mercy, to raise you up. Alas! here we have fallen; we could
not remain standing, and we lie in our perverted desires. However, the one who
created us in righteousness still awaits us and urges us to rise up. He opens
us his bosom full of goodness and seeks to make us return to him through
penance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But we can
not be worthy of penance if we do not know how to do it. To do penance is at
once to mourn the bad deeds that have been committed and to commit no more than
we should then cry. For he who, while mourning his sins, commits others, or has
not begun to do penance, or does not know how to do it. What good is it,
indeed, to deplore his faults of lust, if one remains devoured by the fires of
avarice? Or what is the use of crying for anger, if one continues to consume
the ardor of envy?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But there
is still more to be done: it is not enough for him who regrets his sins to
abstain entirely from committing what he deplores, nor for him who mourns his
vices to fear falling back into it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">16. It
must be seriously considered that whoever remembers having committed wrongdoing
must make the effort to abstain even from certain things which are lawful, and
thus discharge his debt towards his Creator: having committed what was
forbidden to him he must refuse even that which is permitted to him, and
reproach himself for his smallest faults when he remembers having fallen into
greater ones.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What I
have just said would seem exaggerated if I did not confirm it by the testimony
of Sacred Scripture. The Old Testament Law undoubtedly forbids the desire of
others' wives (see Ex 20, 17), but it does not forbid the king, as a
reprehensible thing, from ordering dangerous actions to his soldiers, nor to
want to be brought water. Now we all know how David was driven by the sting of
concupiscence to the point of desiring the woman of another and taking it away
from him (2 S 11: 2-4). Worthy punishments followed his fault, and he expiated
in the lamentations of penance the evil he had committed. Finding himself, long
after, near enemy formations, he very much desired to drink water from the
cistern of Bethlehem (2 S 23, 15). Elite soldiers crossed the enemy troops and
reported, without being wounded, the water desired by the king. But this man,
whom trials had taught, immediately reproached himself for having endangered
the lives of his soldiers by desiring this water, and poured it out for the
Lord, as it is written: libation to the Lord "(2 Sam 23:16). The poured
water thus became a sacrifice offered to the Lord, since the king has expiated
his sin of concupiscence by inflicting pain for his correction. He who in the
past had not feared to desire the wife of others was then afraid of having
desired a little water: the memory of the forbidden actions he had accomplished
made him now severe for him. himself, and led him to abstain even from the
permitted things. Thus we will do [a worthy] penance if we mourn with all our
heart the mistakes we have committed.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Consider
the heavenly riches of our Creator. He saw us sin, and he endured it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">17. God,
who, before the sin, forbade us to sin, does not cease, however, after the sin,
to wait for us to forgive us. See how the very one we despised calls us. We
turned away from him, but he does not turn away from us. This is what Isaiah
says: "And your eyes will see the one who teaches you; and your ears will
hear behind you the voice of him who warns you "(Is 30, 20-21). Man was,
so to speak, forewarned when created in the state of righteousness, he received
the precepts of the righteous life. But when he despised these precepts, he
turned the back of his soul in the face of his Creator. The latter, however,
still follows us from behind to warn us: once rejected by us, he still calls
us. We turn his back, so to speak, by scorning his words and trampling on his
precepts. But standing behind us, he reminds us, we who have turned away from
him. Seeing himself despised, he cries yet by his commandments and waits
patiently.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Consider,
dear brothers, what would be your reaction if the servant to whom you spoke
suddenly made the proud and turned his back on you? If you despise yourself in
your dignity as master, you will not punish his pride and inflict upon him the
wounds of severe punishment? But here we are, by sinning, turning our backs on
our Creator, and yet He supports us. He kindly recalls those who turned away
from him with pride, and he who might have hit us when we turned away from him,
he promises us rewards for us to return. May so great mercy from our Creator
melt our hardness into sin. And that the man, to whom the blows could have made
understand the evil he had committed, blush at least seeing that God is waiting
for him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">18. I go
here, my brethren, to tell you in a few words a story that I learned from the
story of the venerable Maximian, who was then Father of my monastery and
priest, and who is now Bishop of Syracuse. If you agree to listen to me, I do
not doubt that your charity is strengthened for a long time.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">At times
close to ours there was a certain Victorinus, also called Æmilianus, who,
compared to the average condition, had a very good fortune. But the sin of the
flesh being frequently favored by wealth, he came to fall into a fault which he
should have particularly dreaded, while meditating on the horror of the death
which awaited him. Pierced with compunction at the thought of his crime, he reacted
against himself, abandoned all the goods of this world and entered the
monastery. There, he gave the marks of such humility and such self-discipline
that all the brothers who practiced growing up in the love of God could only
despise their own lives at the sight of his penances. . For he applied with all
the strength of his soul to crucify his flesh, to break his own will, to pray
secretly, to wash his faults every day in tears, to seek contempt, and to fear
veneration of his brothers.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He had
gotten used to getting up well before the night vigils that the brothers
celebrated. He took advantage of the remote place that offered a prominence on
the side of the mount where the monastery is located, and he went there every
day before the night service to mortify itself in the tears of penance, of so
much more free in that the place was more secretive. He contemplated the
severity of his coming Judge, and punished by his tears the defilements of his
sin, in order to be in advance in full agreement with this Judge.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">One night,
the abbot of the monastery, who was not sleeping, saw him go out in secret and
followed him on foot outside without being seen. When he had seen him bow to
pray in this remote corner of the mountain, he decided to wait until he got up
to know the duration of his prayer. Now a light from heaven suddenly spread
over the monk who was prostrating himself in prayer, and the light spread in
this place with such abundance that all this part of the mountain shone with
the same light. At this sight, the abbe trembled and fled. As the brother
returned to the monastery after a good hour, his abbot, who wanted to know if
he had been aware of the bright light that had spread over him, tried to
question him in these terms: "Brother, where were you?" The brother,
thinking he could keep the secret, replied that he was at the monastery.
Finding his reluctance, the abbot was obliged to say what he had seen. Finding
himself then discovered, the brother revealed to the abbot what he still did
not know: "When you saw the light from Heaven descending upon me, a voice
accompanied him, who said to me, 'Your sin has been handed. ' "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
certain that Almighty God could have forgiven his sin without speaking; but by
making his voice heard and shining his light, he wanted such an example of his
mercy to provoke our hearts to penance. We admire, dear brothers, that the Lord
has brought down Saul, his persecutor, from heaven, and that he has spoken to
him from heaven. Now, just recently, Victorinus, sinner and penitent, heard a
voice from heaven. If it had been said to the first, "Why do you persecute
me?" (Acts 9, 4), the second one, he deserved to hear: "Your sin was
given to you." This penitent sinner is well inferior to Paul in merit. But
since the Saul we are talking about here still bore cruelty and murder, it can
be said boldly that Saul heard for his pride the voice that reproached him, and
Victorinus for his humility the voice that consoled him. Divine goodness
relieved him, because his humility had thrown him to the ground, while divine
severity humbled the first, because his pride had lifted him up.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Have great
confidence, my brethren, in the mercy of our Creator; think about what you do,
think back to what you did. Consider the bounty of goodness from above, and come
in tears to your merciful Judge while he is still waiting for you. Knowing that
he is right, do not treat your sins with negligence; knowing that he is good,
do not be desperate. The God made man leads man to trust God. What great hope
for us who do penance, since our Judge has become our advocate, who, being God,
lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

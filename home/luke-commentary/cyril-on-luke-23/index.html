<i>And by day He was teaching in the temple, and at night He went out and abode
in the mount called of Olives: and all the people came early to Him in the
temple to hear Him. And the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is
called the Passover, and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might
kill Him: for they feared the people. But Satan entered into Judah, surnamed
Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve, and He went and spoke to the
chief priests and captains, how he might deliver Him to them. And they were
glad, and covenanted to give him money: and he promised, and sought a fitting
season when he could deliver Him to them without the multitude.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">THE
throng of the Jews, together with their ruler, stood up against the glory of
Christ, and contended with the Lord of all. But any one may perceive that it
was against their own souls that they prepared their snare, for they dug for
themselves pitfalls of destruction, and, as the Psalmist says, "The
heathen are taken in the snare which they have made: in the trap which they
have laid is their foot taken.'" For the Saviour and Lord of all, though
His right hand is almighty, and His power overthrows both corruption and death,
yet submitted Himself of His own accord by becoming flesh to the tasting of
death for the life of all, in order that He might make corruption cease, and do
away with the sin of the world, and deliver those that were under the hand of
the enemy from his unendurable tyranny. But that rebellious serpent perhaps
imagined that He had prevailed even over Him, in that He suffered, as I said,
death in the flesh for our sakes, as the dispensation required: but the
wretched being was disappointed of his expectation. <a name="p656"><font color="#000000">|656</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us then see how he missed his game, and shot wide of his mark, when he made
Christ his prey, and delivered Him into the hands of those murderers. It says
then, that "by day He taught in the temple, but lodged during the nights
in the mount called of olives." Now plainly what He taught were things
which surpass the legal service: for the time had come when the shadow must be
changed into the reality. And they heard Him gladly; for oftentimes they had
wondered at Him, "because His word was with power." For He did not,
like one of the holy prophets, or as the hierophant Moses, call out to men,
"These things says the Lord:" but as Himself being He Who of old
spoke by Moses and the prophets, and the Lord of all, He transferred with
godlike authority to a spiritual worship what had been prefigured in types, and
the weakness of the letter: "for the law made nothing perfect."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
He lodged during the nights, as I said, in the Mount of Olives, avoiding the
uproars there were in the city, that He might in this also be a pattern to us.
For it is the duty of those who would lead a life quiet and calm, and, so to
speak, full of rest, to avoid as far as possible the crowd and tumult.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
let us see the course of the devil's malice, and what was the result of his
crafty designs against Him. He had then implanted in the chiefs of the
synagogue of the Jews envy against Christ, which proceeded even to murder. For
always, so to speak, this malady tends to the guilt of murder. Such, at least,
is the natural course of this vice: so it was with Cain and Abel; so plainly it
was in the case of Joseph and his brethren; and therefore the divine Paul also
very clearly makes these sins neighbours, so to speak, of one another, and
akin: for he spoke of some as "full of envy, murder." They sought
therefore to slay Jesus, at the instigation of Satan, who had implanted this
wickedness in them, and who also was their captain in their wicked enterprises.
For he is himself the inventor of murder, and the root of sin, and the fountain
of all wickedness. And what was the contrivance of this many-headed serpent?
"He entered, it says, into Judah Iscariot, who was one of the
twelve." Why not rather into the blessed Peter, or into James, or John, or
some other of the rest of the apostles, but into Judah Iscariot? What place did
Satan find in him? Of all whom we have here mentioned he could approach <a name="p657"><font color="#000000">|657</font></a> none, because their heart was steadfast, and their love to
Christ immoveable; but there was a place for him in the traitor. For the bitter
malady of covetousness, which the blessed Paul says is "the root of all
evil," had overpowered him. For once also when a woman had poured ointment
upon the Saviour, he alone of all rebuked her, saying, "To what purpose is
this waste? For it could have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
But the wise Evangelist rose, so to speak, against his feigned words: for
immediately he adds: "But this he spoke, not because he had forethought
for the poor, but because he was a thief, and carried the purse, and whatever
fell therein, he was the bearer of." And Satan, being crafty in working
evil, whenever he would gain possession of any man's soul, does not attack him
by means of vice generally, but searches out rather that particular passion
which has power over him, and by its means makes him his prey. As he knew
therefore that he was covetous, he leads him to the Pharisees and captains; and
to them he promised that he would betray his teacher. And they purchase the
treachery, or rather their own destruction, with sacred money. Oh! what tears
could suffice, either for him who betrayed Jesus for hire, or for those who
hired him, and purchased with consecrated money a guilty murder! What darkness
had come upon the soul of him who received the bribe! For a little silver, he
lost heaven; he missed the crown of immortality, and the desirable honour of
the apostleship, and to be numbered among the twelve, to whom Christ somewhere
said, "You are the light of the world." He cared not to be a light of
the world: he forgot Christ, Who says, "You who have followed Me in My
temptations, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, you
also shall sit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of
Israel." But he wanted not to reign with Christ. What a confusion too of
error blinded the mind of that covetous man! He delivered to death Him Who is
greater than death. Did you not know that Lazarus was raised on the fourth day
from the grave, and that at His nod the widow's son also revived, and the
daughter of the chief of the synagogue? Did you not hear Him say to the Jews
concerning His body, "Destroy this temple: and in three days I will raise
it up again?" Did you forget His words, "I am <a name="p658"><font color="#000000">|658</font></a>
the resurrection and the life?" What therefore was the cause of such utter
frenzy? The Evangelist tells us, where he says, "Satan entered into
him," having obtained as his pathway and door the passion of avarice. And
yet "the fear of God with a sufficiency is great gain:" and, as the
sacred Scripture says, "We neither brought anything into the world, nor
can we carry [anything] out." And "those who seek to be rich, fall
into numerous and unprofitable lusts, which sink men in pitfalls and
destruction." And of this the disciple who became a traitor is a manifest
proof: for he perished for the sake of a few wretched shekels.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
what shall one say of those who hired him? That they fell into the very same
pitfalls with him. Plainly they were the victims of a like intoxication, even
though they had the reputation of being well acquainted with the law and the
words of the holy prophets. It was their duty to have known the meaning of what
had been spoken of old, as being before decreed by God concerning them. For
among others are words like these, "My wrath is kindled against the
shepherds, and I will visit the lambs." For the wicked shepherds perished
miserably: while the calling of those who were obedient to salvation was a kind
of visitation; for a remnant of Israel was saved. And, as if already, so to speak,
they had fallen into ruin and destruction, and were wailing and weeping on this
account, the prophet hoard, he says, "the voice of shepherds wailing,
because their might was brought low: the voice of lions roaring, because the
pride of Jordan was spoiled." He calls the lions the pride of Jordan, by
whom wore figured the chiefs of the Jewish synagogue: who, in just requital of
their wickedness against Christ, wailed with their fathers and children, being
consumed as with fire and sword, while the temple at Jerusalem was also burnt,
and the cities throughout all Judaea abandoned to utter desolation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which it was fitting for the
passover to be sacrificed. And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare
for us the passover, that we may eat. And they said to Him, Where will You that
we prepare? And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city,
there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him to the house
into which he enters. And say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to
you, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with My
disciples? And he will show you a large upper room, provided with couches;
there make ready. And they went, and found as He said to them; and they made
ready the passover. And when the time was come, He lay down to meat, and the
twelve apostles with Him. And He said to them, I have desired a desire to eat
this passover with you before I suffer: for 1 say to you, that henceforth I
twill not eat of it, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">THE
law by its shadows prefigured from of old the mystery of Christ: and of this He
is Himself the witness where He said to the Jews, "If you had believed
Moses, you would have believed also Me: for he wrote concerning Me." For
everywhere He is set forth, by means of shadows and types, both as slain for
us, as the Lamb without blame and true; and as sanctifying us by His
life-giving blood. And we further find the words of the holy prophets in
complete accordance with those of most wise Moses. But when "the fulness
of time was come," as Paul says, in which the Only-begotten Word of God
was about to submit to the emptying of Himself, and to endure the birth in the
flesh of a woman, and subjection also to the law, according to the measure that
was fitting for human <a name="p660"><font color="#000000">|660</font></a> nature, then He was also sacrificed
for us, as the lamb without blame and true, on the fourteenth day of the first
month. And this feast-time was called Phasek, a word belonging to the Hebrew
language, and signifying the passing over: for so they explain it, and say that
this is its meaning.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
must explain then what it is from which we pass over, and on our journey to
what country, and in what manner we effect it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
then Israel was delivered from the tyranny of the Egyptians, and having loosed
its neck from the yoke of bondage, was now free; and fleeing from the violence
of the tyrant passed with dry foot in a manner wonderful and beyond the power
of language to describe through the midst of the sea, and journeyed onwards to
the promised land: so must we too, who have accepted the salvation that is in
Christ, be willing no longer to abide in our former faults, nor continue in our
evil ways, but manfully cross over the sea, as it were, of the vain trouble of
this world, and the tempest of affairs that is therein. We pass over therefore
from the love of the flesh to temperance; from our former ignorance to the true
knowledge of God; from wickedness to virtue: and in hope at least, from the
blame of sin to the glories of righteousness, and from death to incorruption.
The name therefore of the feast on which Emmanuel bore for us the saving cross,
was the Passover.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
let us behold Him Who is the Truth still honouring the types, and Him Who was
represented therein still permitting the shadows to hold good. "For when
the day, it says, had come, on which it was fitting for the passover to be
sacrificed, He sent to the city two men chosen from the holy apostles, Peter
namely and John, saying, that there shall <a name="p661"><font color="#000000">|661</font></a> meet you a man
carrying a pitcher of water: follow him to the house into which he enters; and
say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, where is the
guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with My disciples?" 'But why,
some one perchance may say, did He not plainly mention the man to those whom He
sent? For He did not say, Having gone to such and such a person, whoever it
might be, there prepare for us at his house the passover: but simply gave them
a sign,----a man bearing a pitcher of water.' To this then what do we reply?
That lo! already Judas the traitor had promised the Jews to deliver Him to
them, and was continuing in His company watching for an opportunity; and while
still making profession of the love that was the duty of a disciple, he had
admitted Satan into his heart, and was travailing with the crime of murder
against our common Saviour Christ. He gives a sign therefore, to prevent him
from learning who the man was, and running to tell those who had hired him.
"For there shall meet you, He says, a man carrying a pitcher of
water."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Or
even perchance He so speaks signifying something mystical and necessary
thereby. For whither the waters enter, even those of holy baptism, there lodges
Christ. How, or in what manner? In that they free us from all impurity, and we
are washed by them from the stains of sin, that we may also become a holy
temple of God, and partakers of His divine nature, by participation of the Holy
Spirit. In order therefore that Christ may rest and lodge in us, let us receive
the saving waters, confessing moreover the faith that justifies the wicked, and
raises us aloft so as for us to be accounted "an upper room." For
those in whom Christ dwells by faith have a mind raised aloft, unwilling to
creep upon the dust, and refusing, so to speak, to be set upon the earth, and
everywhere seeking that which is exalted in virtue. For it is written, that
"the mighty ones of God are raised high above the earth." "For here
they have no abiding city, but seek that which is to come:" and while
walking upon earth, their thoughts are set upon those things which are above,
and "their dwelling is in heaven." <a name="p662"><font color="#000000">|662</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
may also notice something true, but wonderful, that happens, so to speak, constantly
among us: namely that those who prize their carnal life are often puffed up,
and have their heart full of pride accursed and hated of God; but yet perhaps
they are brought to humiliation even upon earth: while those who are poor in
spirit obtain exaltation by the honour and glory which comes from God. For as
the disciple of Christ writes, "Let the humble brother glory in his
exaltation, but "the rich in suffering humiliation: because as the flower
of the grass he shall pass away." He therefore would not miss the truth,
who should say that the soul of every saint is "an upper room."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
then the disciples had prepared the passover, Christ ate it with them, being
long-suffering towards the traitor, and deigning to admit him to the table from
His infinite loving-kindness: for he was already a traitor, because Satan was
lodging within him. And what did Christ also say to the holy apostles? "I
have desired a desire to eat this passover with you." Let us examine the
deep purport of this expression: let us search out the meaning concealed
therein, and what it is which the Saviour intends.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
then I have already said that covetous disciple was seeking an opportunity to
betray Him: and, that he might not deliver Him to His murderers before the
feast of the passover, the Saviour did not declare either the house or the
person with whom He would celebrate the feast. To explain therefore to them the
cause of His unwillingness openly to tell them with whom He would lodge, He
says, "I have desired a desire to eat with you this passover:"
apparently meaning, I have used all diligence to enable me to escape the
wickedness of the traitor, that I might not endure My passion before the time.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"But
I will not eat of this passover until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
And in this again Christ utters a profound and mysterious truth, of which He
Himself, however, reveals to us the meaning. For it is His custom to give the
name of "the kingdom of heaven" to justification by faith, to the
cleansing that is by holy baptism and the participation of the Holy Spirit, and
to the offering of spiritual service, now rendered possible by the entering in
of the gospel laws. But these things are the means of our being made partakers
of the <a name="p663"><font color="#000000">|663</font></a> promises, and of our reigning together with
Christ: and therefore He says, "I will no more draw near to such a
passover as this," one namely that consisted in the typical eating,----for
a lamb of the flock was slain to be the type of the true Lamb,----"until
it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God:" that is, until the time has
appeared in which the kingdom of heaven is preached. For this is fulfilled in
us, who honour the worship that is superior to the law, even the true passover;
nor is it a lamb of the flock which sanctifies those who are in Christ, but
Himself rather, being made a holy sacrifice for us, by the offering of
bloodless oblations, and the mystical giving of thanks, in which we are blessed
and quickened with life. For He became for us "the living bread that came
down from heaven, and gives life to the world:" by Whom and with Whom to
God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.

<i>And He took a cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it with
one another: for I say to you, that I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of
the vine, until the kingdom of God is fulfilled. And He took bread, and gave
thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is My body, which is given
for you: do this in remembrance of Me. In like manner also the cup, after He
had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed
for you. But, behold! the hand of him that betrays Me is with Me at the table.

be made partakers of Christ, both intellectually and by our senses, fills us
with every blessing. For He dwells in us, first, by the Holy Spirit, and we are
His abode, according to that which was said of old by one of the holy prophets.
"For I will dwell in them, He says,. and lead them: and I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to Me a people."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
He is also within us in another way by means of our partaking in the oblation
of bloodless offerings, which we celebrate in the churches, having received
from Him the saving pattern of the rite, as the blessed Evangelist plainly
shows us in the passage which has just been read. For He tells us that "He
took a cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it with one
another." Now by His giving thanks, by which is meant His speaking to God
the Father in the manner of prayer, He signified to us that He, so to speak,
shares and takes part in His good pleasure in granting us the life-giving blessing
which was then bestowed upon us: for every grace, and every perfect gift comes
to us from <a name="p665"><font color="#000000">|665</font></a> the Father by the Son in the Holy Spirit. And
this act then was a pattern for our use of the prayer which ought to be
offered, whenever the grace of the mystical and life-giving oblation is about
to be spread before Him by us: and so accordingly we are wont to do. For first
offering up our thanksgivings, and joining in our praises to God the Father
both the Son and the Holy Spirit, we so draw near to the holy tables, believing
that we receive life and blessing both spiritually and corporeally: for we
receive in us the Word of the Father, Who for our sakes became man, and Who is
Life, and the Giver of life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us then enquire, to the best of our ability, what is the view held among us of
this mystery: for it is our duty to be "ready to give an answer concerning
the hope that is in us," as the wise Peter says. "The God of all
therefore created all things for immortality, and the beginnings of the world
were life; but by the envy of the devil death entered the world:" for it
was that rebel serpent who led the first man to the transgression of the
commandment, and to disobedience, by means of which he fell under the divine
curse, and into the net of death: for it was said to him, "Earth you are,
and to the earth you shall return." Was it then right that one who was
created for life and immortality should be made mortal, and condemned to death
without power of escape? Must the envy of the devil be more unassailable and
enduring than the will of God? Not so: for it has been brought to nought; and
the clemency of the Creator has transcended the evil effects of his malignity.
He has given aid to those upon earth. And what then was the manner in which He
aided them? One truly great, and admirable, and worthy of God; yes, worthy in
the very highest degree of the supreme Mind. For God the Father is by His own
nature Life; and as alone being so, He caused the Son to shine forth Who also
Himself is Life: for it could not be otherwise with Him <a name="p666"><font color="#000000">|666</font></a>
Who is the Word That proceeded substantially from the Life: for He must, I say
must, also Himself be Life, as being One Who sprang forth from Life, from Him
Who begat Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">God
the Father therefore gives life to all things by the Son in the Holy Spirit:
and every thing that exists and breathes in heaven and on earth, its existence
and life is from God the Father by the Son in the Holy Spirit. Neither
therefore the nature of angels, nor any thing else whatsoever that was made,
nor aught that from non-existence was brought into being, possesses life as the
fruit of its own nature: but, on the contrary, life proceeds, as I said, from
the Substance which transcends all: and to it only it belongs, and is possible
that it can give life, because it is by nature life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In
what manner therefore can man upon earth, clothed as he is with mortality,
return to incorruption? I answer, that this dying flesh must be made partaker
of the life-giving power which comes from God. But the life-giving power of God
the Father is the Only-begotten Word: and Him He sent to us as a Saviour and
Deliverer. And how He sent Him, the blessed John the Evangelist clearly tells
us, saying, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us." But He
became flesh, not by having undergone any change or alteration into what He had
not been, nor again by having ceased to be the Word;----for He knows not what
it is to suffer the shadow of a change;----but rather by having been born in
the flesh of a woman, and taken to Himself that body which He received from her,
in order that, having implanted Himself in us by an inseparable union, He might
raise us above the power both of death and corruption. And Paul is our witness,
where he says of Him and of us, "For inasmuch as the children are
partakers of blood and flesh, so He in like manner was partaker of the same,
that by death He might bring him to nought who has dominion over death, that
is, the devil; and deliver all them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage. For He does not take hold of angels, "but He
took hold of the seed of Abraham: for which reason it was right for Him in all
things to be made like to His brethren:" that is, to us. For He was made
in our <a name="p667"><font color="#000000">|667</font></a> likeness, and clothed Himself in our flesh, that
by raising it from the dead He might prepare a way henceforth, by which the
flesh which had been humbled to death might return anew to incorrupt-ion. For
we are united to Him just as also we were united to Adam, when he brought upon
himself the penalty of death. And Paul testifies thereunto, thus writing on one
occasion, "For because by man is death, by man is also the resurrection of
the dead:" and again upon another, "For as in Adam all die, even so
in Christ shall all live." The Word therefore, by having united to Himself
that flesh which was subject to death, as being God and Life drove away from it
corruption, and made it also to be the source of life: for such must the body
of (Him Who is) the Life be.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
do not disbelieve what I have said, but rather accept the word in faith, having
gathered proofs thereof from a few examples. When you cast a piece of bread
into wine or oil, or any other liquid, you find that it becomes charged with
the quality of that particular thing. When iron is brought into contact with
fire, it becomes full of its activity; and while it is by nature iron, it
exerts the power of fire. And so the life-giving Word of God, having united
Himself to His own flesh in a way known to Himself, endowed it with the power
of giving life. And of this He certifies us Himself, saying, "Verily, I
say to you, he that believes in Me has everlasting life. I am the bread of
life." And again, "I am the living bread, that came down from heaven;
if a man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I shall give
is My flesh for the life of the world. Verily, I say to you, that if you eat
not the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you have no life in you.
Whoever eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, has eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
He that eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, abides in Me, and I in him. As the
living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father; so He that eats Me
shall also live because of Me." When therefore we eat the holy flesh of
Christ, the Saviour of us all, and drink His precious blood, we have life in
us, being made <a name="p668"><font color="#000000">|668</font></a> as it were, one with Him, and abiding in
Him, and possessing Him also in us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
let none of those whose wont it is to disbelieve say, 'Since therefore the Word
of God, being by nature life, dwells in us also, is the body of each one of us
too endowed with the power of giving life?' Rather let him know that it is a
perfectly different thing for the Son to be in us by a relative participation,
and for Himself to become flesh, that is, to make that body His own which was
taken from the blessed Virgin. For He is not said to become incarnate and be
made flesh by being in us: but rather this happened once for all when He became
man without ceasing to be God. The body therefore of the Word was that assumed
by Him from the holy virgin, and made one with Him; but how, or in what manner
this was done, we cannot tell: for it is incapable of explanation, and
altogether beyond the powers of the mind, and to Himself alone is the manner of
the union known.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
was titling therefore for Him to be in us both divinely by the Holy Spirit, and
also, so to speak, to be mingled with our bodies by His holy flesh and precious
blood: which things also we possess as a life-giving eucharist, in the form of
bread and wine. For lest we should be terrified by seeing (actual) flesh and
blood placed upon the holy tables of our churches, God, humbling Himself to our
infirmities, infuses into the things set before us the power of life, and
transforms them into the efficacy of His flesh, that we may have them for a
life-giving participation, and that the body of (Him Who is the) Life may be
found in us as a life-producing seed. And do not doubt that this is true, since
Himself plainly says, "This is My body: "This is My blood:" but
rather receive in faith the Saviour's word; for He, being the Truth, cannot
lie. And so will you honour Him; for as the very wise John says, "He that
receives His witness has set his seal that God is true. For He Whom God sent
speaks the words of God." For the words of God are of course true, and in
no manner whatsoever can they be false: for even though we understand not in
what way God works acts such as these, yet He Himself knows the way of His
works. For when Nicodemus could not understand His words concerning holy
baptism, and foolishly said, <a name="p669"><font color="#000000">|669</font></a> "How can those things
be?" he heard Christ in answer say, "Verily I say to you, that we
speak that which we know, and testify that which we see, and you receive not
our testimony. If I have spoken to you the earthly things, and you believe not,
how will you believe if I tell you the heavenly things?" For how indeed
can a man learn those things which transcend the powers of our mind and reason?
Let therefore this our divine mystery be honoured by faith.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
Judas the traitor, who was eating with Him, was reproved in those words which
Christ spoke, "But behold the hand of him who betrays Me is with Me at the
table." For he imagined perchance in his great senselessness, or rather as
being filled with the haughtiness of the devil, that he could deceive Christ,
though He be God. But, as I said, he was convicted of being altogether wicked,
and hateful to God, and traitorous: and yet admission was deigned him to the
table, and he was counted worthy of the divine gentleness even to the end: but
thereby is his punishment made the more severe. For Christ has somewhere said
of him by the Psalmist's voice, "That if an enemy had reproached Me, I had
borne it: and if he that hated Me had spoken against Me proud things, I had hid
myself from him. But it was you, My like in soul, My neighbour and My
acquaintance, who in My company had sweetened for Me meats, and we went to the
house of the Lord in concord." Woe therefore to him, according to the
Saviour's word! For He indeed, according to the good will of God the Father,
gave Himself in our stead, that He might deliver us from all evil: but the man
who betrayed into the hands of murderers the Saviour and Deliverer of all, will
have for his inheritance the condemnation which is the devil's fitting
punishment. For his guilt was not against one such as we are, but against the
Lord of all: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion,
with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p670"><font color="#000000">|670</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

you, and watch," is the summons to us of one of the holy apostles: for
every where the net of sin is spread, and Satan makes us his prey in various
ways, seizing hold of us by many passions, and so leading us on to a reprobate
mind. Those therefore must be awake who would not willingly be subject to his
power: for thereby they will gain the victory by Christ's help, Who cares for
our souls, and delivers them from every passion, that so with sound and
vigorous mind they may run along the praiseworthy and gainful pathway of that
mode of life which is pleasing to Him. For how great His mercy is towards us,
the purport of the lessons set before us once again declares. For the disciples
had given way to a human infirmity, and were contending with one another, who
of them is the chief, and superior to the rest; for those perchance who held
the second rank among them were not willing to give way to those who held the
first. But even this arose, and was recorded for our benefit, that that which
happened to the holy apostles may prove a reason for humility in us. For Christ
immediately rebukes the malady, and like a vigorous physician cut away, by an
earnest and deep-reaching commandment, the passion which had sprung up among
them.  <a name="p671"><font color="#000000">|671</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
it was from an unprofitable love of glory, the root of which is pride, that
this vain and senseless ambition had, so to speak, shot up. For the very fact
of wishing at all to be sot over others, and to strive for this end, renders a
man liable to be justly blamed: though, on the other hand, it is not absolutely
destitute of that which may fitly be praised. For to be exalted in virtue is worthy
of all estimation: but those who would attain to it must be of modest mind, and
possess such humbleness of feeling as to abandon out of love to the brethren
all idea of preeminence. And such the blessed Paul would also have us be, thus
writing, "Consider as regards your companions, that in honour they are
better than you." For so to feel is highly worthy of the saints, and
renders them glorious, and makes our piety to God more worthy of honour: it
tears the net of the devil's malice, and breaks his manifold snares, and
rescues us from the pitfalls of depravity: and finally, it perfects us in the
likeness of Christ the Saviour of us all. For listen how He sets Himself before
us as the pattern of a humble mind, and of a will not set on vainglory: for "Learn,
He says, of Me, Who am meek and lowly in heart."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Here,
however, in the passage which, has just been read He says, "For which is
the chief, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is not he that
reclines? But I am in the midst of you as he that serves." And when Christ
thus speaks, who can be so obdurate and unyielding as not to cast away all
vaingloriousness, and banish from his mind the love of empty honour? For He Who
is ministered to by the whole creation of rational and holy beings; Who is lauded
by the seraphim; Who is tended by the services of the universe; He Who is the
equal of God the Father in His throne and kingdom; taking a servant's place,
washed the holy apostles<sup> </sup>feet. And in another way moreover He holds
the post of servitude, by reason of the dispensation in the flesh. And of this
the blessed Paul bears witness, where he writes; "For I say that Christ
was a minister of the circumcision to fulfil the promises of the fathers; and
the Gentiles shall praise God for mercy." He therefore Who is ministered
to became a minister; and the Lord of glory made Himself poor, "leaving us
an example," as it is written.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us therefore avoid the love of vainglory, and deliver <a name="p672"><font color="#000000">|672</font></a>
ourselves from the blame attached to the desire of chieftainship. For so to act
makes us like to Him Who submitted to empty Himself for our sakes: while
superciliousness and haughtiness of mind make us plainly resemble the princes
of the Gentiles, to whom an arrogant bearing is ever, so to speak, dear, or
even perhaps fitting. "For they are called, He says, benefactors,"
that is, are flattered as such by their inferiors. Be it so then, that they, as
not being within the pale of the sacred laws, nor obedient to the Lord's will,
are the victims of these maladies: but let it not be so with us; rather let our
exaltation consist in humility, and our glorying in not loving glory; and let
our desire be set upon those things which are well-pleasing to God, while we
bear in mind what the wise man says to us, "The greater you are, humble
yourself the more, and you shall find grace before the Lord." For He
rejects the proud, and counts the boastful as His enemies, but crowns with
honours the meek and lowly in mind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
Saviour therefore drives away from the holy apostles the malady of vaingloriousness:
but they perchance might think among themselves, and even say, 'What therefore
will be the reward of fidelity? or what advantage shall they receive, who have
laboured in attendance upon Him, when temptations from time to time befall? In
order therefore that being confirmed by the hope of the blessings that are in
store, they may cast away from their minds all slothfulness in virtuous
pursuits, and choose rather with earnest mind to follow Him, and take pleasure
in labours for His sake, and count the doing so a cause of gain, and the
pathway of joy, and the means of eternal glory, He necessarily says, "You
are they who have remained with Me in My temptations: and I will make a
covenant with you, as My Father has appointed for Me a kingdom, that you shall
eat and drink at My table in My kingdom: and you shall also sit on twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Observe, I pray, that He
does not yet quit the limits of humanity, but for the present confines Himself
within them, because He had not as yet endured the precious cross; for He
speaks as one of us: but after the resurrection from the dead He revealed His
glory, the season calling Him thereto: for He said, "All power has been
given Me in heaven and in earth." He speaks therefore, as I said, <a name="p673"><font color="#000000">|673</font></a> in human fashion, as not having yet mounted above the
measure of His humiliation. For this reason He says, that "as My Father
has made with Me a covenant of a kingdom, so I also will make a covenant with
you, that you shall eat and drink constantly at My table in My kingdom."
Is it the case then, that even after the resurrection from the dead, when the
time has come in which we shall be with Christ, and He will endow us with the
likeness of His glorified body; even after we have thus put on incorruption, is
it, I say, the case, that we shall again be in need of food and of tables? Or
is it not then utterly foolish to say or wish to imagine anything of the sort?
For when we have put off corruption, of what bodily refreshment shall we henceforth
be in need? And if so, what is the meaning of the expression, "You shall
eat at My table in "My kingdom?" I answer, that once again from the
ordinary matters of life He declares to us things spiritual. For those who
enjoy the foremost honours with earthly kings banquet with them, and eat in
their company: and this is counted by them the summit of glory. And there are
too others, esteemed worthy of honour by those in power, who nevertheless are
not permitted to draw near to the same table with them. To show then that they
will enjoy the highest honours with Him, He uses an example taken from ordinary
life, and says, "I will make a covenant with you, that you shall eat and
drink at My table in My kingdom: and you shall sit also upon twelve thrones judging
Israel."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

obtained the foremost honours with Christ, the Saviour of all, because by faith

the proclamations of the Gospel, saying, "You who thirst, go to the
waters." But these waters are not the material waters of earth, but rather
are divine and spiritual, poured forth for us by Christ Himself. For He is the
river of peace, and the torrent of pleasure, and the fountain of life. And so
we have heard Himself plainly saying, "Whosoever thirsts, let him come to
Me and drink." Come therefore, that here also we may delight ourselves in
the sacred and divine streams which now from Him: for what says He to Peter?<i>

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
it is, I think, both necessary and profitable for us to know what the occasion
was which led our Saviour's words to this point. The blessed disciples then had
been disputing with one another, "which of them was the great one:"
but the Saviour of all, as the means whereby they obtained whatsoever was
useful and necessary for their good, delivered them from the guilt of ambition,
by putting away from them the striving after objects such as this, and
persuading them to escape from the lust of preeminence, as from a pitfall of
the devil. For He said, "he who is great among you, let him be as the
youngest, and he who governs as he that serves." And He further taught
them that the season of honour is not so much this present time as that which
is to be at the coming of His kingdom. For there they shall receive the rewards
of <a name="p675"><font color="#000000">|675</font></a> their fidelity, and be partakers of His eternal glory,
and wear a crown of surpassing honour, eating at His table, and sitting also
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
lo! He also offers them a third assistance, as we read in the lessons before
us. For He teaches us, that we must think humbly of ourselves, as being
nothing, both as regards the nature of man and the readiness of our mind to
fall away into sin, and as strengthened and being what we are only through Him
and of Him. If therefore it is from Him that we borrow both our salvation, and
our seeming to be something in virtue and piety, what reason have we for proud
thoughts? For all we have is from Him, and of ourselves we have nothing.
"For what have you that you did not receive? But if you also received it,
why do you glory, as though you did not receive it?" So spoke the very
wise Paul: and further, the blessed David also at one time says, "In God
we shall make strength:" and at another again, "Our God is our house
of refuge and our strength." And the prophet Jeremiah also has somewhere
said, "O Lord, my strength and my house of refuge, and my help in the days
of trouble." And the blessed Paul also may be brought forward, who says
with great clearness, "I can do all things through Christ, Who strengthens
me." Yes, Christ Himself also somewhere says to us, "Without Me you
can do nothing.<sup>11</sup></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us then glory not in ourselves, but rather in His gifts. And if this be the
state of any one's mind, what place can the desire of being set above other men
find in him, when thus we are all both partakers of the same one grace, and
also have the same Lord of hosts as the Giver both of our existence and of our
ability to do well. To humble therefore our tendency to superciliousness, and
to repress ambitious feelings, Christ shows that even he who seemed to be great
is nothing and infirm. He therefore passes by the other disciples, and turns to
him who is the foremost, and set at the head of the company, and says;
"that Satan has many times desired to sift you as wheat:" that is, to
search and try you, and expose you to intolerable blows. For it is Satan's wont
to attack men of more than ordinary excellence, and, like some fierce and
arrogant barbarian, he challenges to single combat those of chief repute in the
ways of piety. So he challenged Job, but was defeated <a name="p676"><font color="#000000">|676</font></a> by
his patience, and the boaster fell, being vanquished by the endurance of that
triumphant hero. But human nature he makes his prey, for it is infirm, and easy
to be overcome: while he is harsh and pitiless and unappeasable in heart. For,
as the sacred Scripture says of him, "His heart is hard as a stone: and he
stands like an anvil that cannot be beaten out </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_13_sermons_135_145.htm#6" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>6</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">." Yet he is placed under the feet of the saints by
Christ's might: for He has said, "Behold, I have given you to tread on
serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall
hurt you." "Satan therefore, He says, has desired to sift you like
wheat: but I have offered supplication in your behalf, that your faith fail
not."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">See
again, He humbles Himself to us, and speaks according to the limits of man's
estate, and yet He is God by nature, even though He became flesh. For though He
is the power of the Father, by Whom all things are preserved, and from Whom
they obtain the ability to continue in well-being, He yet says that He offers
supplication as a man. For it was necessary, yes necessary, for Him Who, for
the dispensation's sake, became like to us, to use also our words, when the
occasion called Him thereto in accordance with what the dispensation itself
required. "I have supplicated therefore, He says, that your faith fail
not." Now by this then He shows, that if he had been yielded up to Satan
to be tempted, he would have proved altogether unfaithful: since, even when not
so yielded up, he proved weak from human feebleness, being unable to bear the
fear of death. For he denied Christ, when a young girl troubled him in the high
priest's palace by saying, "And you also are one of His disciples."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
Saviour then forewarned him what would have been the result had he been yielded
up to Satan's temptation: but at the same time He offers him the word of
consolation, and says, "And do you also hereafter, when converted,
strengthen your brethren:" that is, be the support, and instructor and
teacher of those who draw near to Me by faith. And moreover, admire the
beautiful skill of the passage, and the surpassing greatness of the divine
gentleness! For, lest his impending fall should lead the disciple to
desperation, as though he would be expelled from the glories of the
apostleship, and <a name="p677"><font color="#000000">|677</font></a> his former following (of Christ) lose
its reward, because of his proving unable to bear the fear of death, and
denying Him, at once Christ fills him with good hope, and grants him the
confident assurance that he shall be counted worthy of the promised blessings,
and gather the fruits of steadfastness. For He says, "And do you also,
when converted, strengthen your brethren." O what great and incomparable
kindness! The disciple had not yet sickened with the malady of faithlessness,
and already he has received the medicine of forgiveness: not yet had the sin
been committed, and he receives pardon: not yet had he fallen, and the saving
hand is held out: not yet had he faltered, and he is confirmed: for "do you,
He says, when converted, strengthen your brethren." So to speak belongs to
One Who pardons, and restores him again to apostolic powers.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
Peter, in the ardour of his zeal, made profession of steadfastness and
endurance to the last extremity, saying that he would manfully resist the
terrors of death, and count nothing of bonds; but in so doing he erred from
what was right. For he ought not, when the Saviour told him that he would prove
weak to have contradicted Him, loudly protesting the contrary; for the Truth
could not lie: but rather he ought to have asked strength of Him, that either
he might not suffer this, or be rescued immediately from harm. But, as I have
already said, being fervent in spirit, and warm in his love towards Christ, and
of unrestrainable zeal in rightly performing those duties which become a
disciple in his attendance upon his Master, he declares that he will endure to
the last extremity: but he was rebuked for foolishly speaking against what was
foreknown, and for his unreasonable haste in contradicting the Saviour's words.
For this reason He says, "Verily I tell you, that the cock shall not crow
to-night, until you have thrice denied Me." And this proved true. Let us
not therefore think highly of ourselves, even if we see ourselves greatly
distinguished for our virtues: rather let us offer up the praises of our
thanksgivings to Christ Who redeems us, and Who also it is that grants us even
the desire to be able to act rightly: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father
be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for over and ever, Amen. <a name="p678"><font color="#000000">|678</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: for our God is a
consuming fire." And another holy prophet has also said concerning Him,
"His wrath consumes the princes, and the rocks are melted at Him."
Moreover the blessed David says of Him somewhere in the Psalms, "You are
to be feared, and who shall rise up before You at Your wrath?" For what
power of man, or of ought whatsoever that is created, can stand against the
irresistible force of Almighty God? But His wrath does not descend upon any
righteous man whatsoever;----for God does not commit injustice;----but upon
those rather whose sins are numerous and intolerable, and their wickedness
beyond bounds.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
as an example of what we have said, take that which happened to the Jewish
multitudes after Christ rose from the dead, and ascended up to heaven. For God
the Father sent to them His Son, inviting them to a service superior to the
law, and to the knowledge of all good: He sent Him to free them from all guilt,
and deliver them from the stains of sin; to bring them to the adoption of sons,
to glory, to honour, and to the communion of the Holy Spirit; to life
incorruptible; to never-ending glory; and to the kingdom of heaven. But though
they ought eagerly to have hastened to this <a name="p679"><font color="#000000">|679</font></a> grace, and
with grateful praises have honoured Him Who came to aid them, and joyfully have
accepted the grace that is by faith, they did verily nothing of the kind, but
betook themselves to the very reverse: for they rose up against Him, setting
Him at nought by their disobedience, reviling even His divine signs, and after
doing and saying every thing that was abominable, finally they crucified Him.
And so it became their lot to suffer those things which the company also of the
holy prophets had before proclaimed. For one of them said, "God shall put
them far away, because they did not hear Him, and they shall be wanderers among
the nations." And again, "Because Jerusalem is forsaken, and Judah is
fallen, and their tongues are with iniquity; they disobey the Lord; therefore
now is their glory brought low, and the shame of their faces has stood up
against them." And in another place they are thus addressed as in the
person of God over all; " And now, because you have done all these works,
and I spoke to you and you did not hear, and I called to you and you answered
not: therefore will I do to this house, on which My name is called, and wherein
you trust; and to this place which I have given to you and to your fathers as I
did to Shilom: and I will cast you from before My face, as I cast away your
brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim." For they were delivered up, as
I have said, to desolation, and were dispersed over all the earth, their temple
being consumed with fire, and all Judaea taken captive.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">That
this would be the case Christ had before announced to the disciples, the
occasion which caused Him to speak upon this subject being some such as
follows: He had forewarned the admirable Peter, that he would thrice deny Him,
at the time namely of His seizure, when the band of Pilate's soldiers with the
officers of the Jews brought Him to the chief priests for judgment: for there
Peter denied Him. And inasmuch as mention had now once been made of His
seizure, and of his being taken before Caiaphas, there naturally followed upon
this allusion a reference to that also which was next to come to pass, even His
passion upon the cross: and then it was that He foretold the war about to burst
upon the Jews, and which with unendurable violence spread like some <a name="p680"><font color="#000000">|680</font></a> river over all their land. On this account He says;
"When I sent you without purse and without bag and shoes, lacked you
anything? And they said, No." For the Saviour sent the holy apostles, with
the command to preach to the inhabitants of every village and city the gospel
of the kingdom of heaven, and to heal every grief and every sickness among the
people. And on their journey He bade them not to occupy themselves with things
that concern the body, but rather without baggage and unencumbered, and resting
all their hope of sustenance on Him, so to traverse the land: and this they
also did, making themselves an example of praiseworthy and apostolic conduct.
"But now, He says, he that has a purse, let him take it, and a bag in like
manner." Tell me then, was this because on second thoughts a more
serviceable plan was devised? Would it have been better on the former occasion
also to have had bag and purse? Or if not, what was the cause of so sudden a
change? What need had the holy apostles of purse and bag? What answer must we
give to this? That the saying in appearance had reference to them, but in
reality applied to the person of every Jew: for they it rather was. whom Christ
addressed. For He did not say that the holy apostles must get purse and bag,
but that "whosoever has a purse, let him take it," meaning thereby,
that whosoever had property in the Jewish territories, should collect all that
he had together, and flee, so that if he could any how save himself, he might
do so. But any one who had not the means of equipping himself for travel, and
who from extreme poverty must continue in the land, let even such one, He says,
sell his cloak, and buy a sword: for henceforth the question with all those who
continue in the land will not be whether they possess anything or not, but
whether they can exist and preserve their lives. For war shall befal them with
such unendurable impetuosity, that nothing shall be able to stand against it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
next He tells them the cause of the evil, and of a tribulation so severe and
irremediable befalling them, saying, "that He is about according to the
Scriptures to be numbered with the transgressors," plainly referring to
His being hung upon the cross with the thieves who were crucified with Him, and
so enduring a transgressor's punishment: "and the <a name="p681"><font color="#000000">|681</font></a>
dispensation, having come to this, will now have an end." For He endured
indeed for our sakes His saving passion, and thus far the daring wickedness of
the Jews proceeded, and this was the consummation of their unbridled fury: but
after the passion upon the cross every hand was powerless, "for the enemy
had no advantage over Him, and the Son of wickedness could no more hurt
Him.'" For He arose, having trampled upon the grave; He ascended up into
heaven, He sat down on the right hand of God the Father; and hereafter He shall
come, not in mean estate, as of old, nor in the measure of human nature, but in
the glory of the Father, with the holy angels as His body-guard; and He shall
sit also upon the throne of His glory, "judging the world in
righteousness," as it is written. Then, as the prophet says, "they
shall look on Him Whom they pierced:" and Him Whom these wretched beings
ridiculed, as they saw Him hang on the precious cross, they shall behold
crowned with godlike glory, and in just retribution of their wickedness towards
Him, shall fall into the pit of destruction. "What therefore, He says,
concerns Me, has an end," as far, that is, as relates to My suffering death
in the flesh. And then shall those things which were foretold by the holy
prophets in old time, happen to those who slew Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
in foretelling these things, the Lord was speaking of what was about to happen
to the country of the Jews. But the divine disciples did not understand the
deep meaning of what was said, but supposed rather that He meant that swords
were necessary, because of the attack about to be made upon Him by the disciple
who betrayed Him, and by those who were assembled to seize Him. For this reason
they say, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." And what is the
Saviour's reply? "It is enough." Observe how, so to say, He even
ridicules their speech, well knowing that the disciples not having understood
the force of what was said, thought that swords were required, because of the
attack about to be made upon Himself. Fixing His look therefore upon those
things which happened to the Jews because of their wicked conduct towards Him,
the Saviour, as I said, ridicules their speech, and says, "It is
enough:" yes, forsooth, two swords are enough to bear the brunt of the war
about to come upon them, to meet which <a name="p682"><font color="#000000">|682</font></a> many thousand
swords were of no avail. For a mighty resistance was made by the pride of the
Jews against the forces of Augustus Caesar: but they availed nothing; for they
were besieged with overpowering might, and suffered all misery. For as the
prophet Isaiah says, "That which the holy God purposes, who shall bring to
nought? and His hand, when lifted up, who shall turn aside?" Let us beware
therefore of provoking God to anger: for it is a fearful thing to fall into His
hands. But to those who believe in Christ He is merciful; even to those who
praise Him; who call Him their Redeemer and Deliverer; who minister to Him with
spiritual service, and by all virtuous conduct: for if so we act and speak,
Christ will make us His own; by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise
and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Pray that you enter not into temptation. And He went apart from them about a

Lord Jesus Christ requires those who love Him to be accurate investigators of
whatsoever is written concerning Him: for He has said, "that the kingdom
of heaven is like to a treasure hid in a field." For the mystery of Christ
is deposited, so to speak, at a great depth, nor is it plain to the many: but
he who uncovers it by means of an accurate knowledge, finds the riches which
are therein, and resembles that wise woman, even Mary, of whom Christ said,
that "she had chosen the good part, that should not be taken away from
her." For these earthly and temporal things fade away with the flesh: but
those which are divine and intellectual, and that benefit the life of the soul,
are firmly established, and their possession cannot be shaken. Let us look therefore
into the meaning of the lessons set before us. "By day then the Saviour
abode in Jerusalem," instructing evidently the Israelites, and revealing
to them the way of the kingdom of heaven; but when the evening came, He
continued with the holy disciples on the Mount of Olives at a spot called
Gethsemane: for so the wise Evangelist Matthew tells us. <a name="p684"><font color="#000000">|684</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When
therefore Christ came thither, as the same Matthew again somewhere says,
"He took Peter and James and John, and began to be grieved and sore distressed;
and to say to them, My soul is sorrowful even to death. And again, having gone
a little forward, He kneeled and prayed, saying, Father, if You will, put away
from Me this cup; but not My will, but Yours be done." Behold here, I
pray, the profoundness of the dispensation in the flesh, and the height of that
wisdom which no words can tell: fix upon it the penetrating eye of the mind:
and if you can see the beautiful art of the mystery, you also will say,
"O! the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out." "He
began, it says, to be grieved, and sore distressed." For what reason, O
Lord? Were You also terrified at death? Did You being seized with fear draw
back from suffering? And yet did not You teach the holy apostles to make no
account of the terrors of death, saying, "Fear not them who kill the body,
but are not able to kill the soul." And if too any one were to say that
the grace of spiritual fortitude is Your gift to the elect, he would not err
from the truth: for all strength is from You, and all confidence and heartiness
of mind in every more excellent encounter. You are by nature Life, and the
cause of life. You we look for as a Saviour and Deliverer, and the Destroyer of
corruption. From You all receive their life and being. You have made every
thing that breathes. The angels are for You, and from You, and by You, and so
is the whole rational creation. Unto You the blessed David spoke concerning us,
"You send Your Spirit, and they are created: and You renew the face of the
ground." How therefore are You grieved, and sore distressed, and
sorrowful, even to death? For plainly You knew, in that You are God by nature,
and know whatsoever is about to happen, that by enduring death in the flesh You
would free from death the inhabitants of all the earth, and bring Satan to
shame:----that You would set up a trophy of victory over every evil and
opposing power: that You would be known by every one, and worshipped as the God
and Creator of all. You knew that You would plunder hell:----that You would <a name="p685"><font color="#000000">|685</font></a> deliver those that are therein, from bonds that had endured
for many ages: that You wouldst turn to You all that is under heaven. These
things You did Yourself announce to us of old by the holy prophets. We have
heard You clearly saying, when You were like to us, "Now is the judgment
of this world: now will the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men to Me." "Verily I say to
you, that if a grain of wheat fall not into the ground and die, it abides
alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit." For what reason
therefore are You grieved and sore distressed? Yes, He says, not unbefittingly
am I found thus in anguish. For I know indeed that by consenting to suffer the
passion upon the cross, I shall deliver all beneath the heaven from every evil,
and be the cause of unending blessings to the inhabitants of the whole earth. I
am not unaware of the unloosing of death, and the abolition of corporeal
corruption, and the overthrow of the tyranny of the devil, and the remission of
sin. But all the same it grieves Me for Israel the firstborn, that henceforth
He is not even among the servants. The portion of the Lord, and the cord of My inheritance,
will be "the portion of foxes," as it is written. He Who was the
beloved one is greatly hated: he who had the promises is utterly stripped of My
gifts: the pleasant vineyard with its rich grapes henceforth will be a desert
land, a place dried up, and without water. "For I will command the clouds
that they rain no rain upon it." "I will break through its hedge, and
it shall be a spoil: and I will beat down its wall, and it shall be trampled
under foot." And tell me then, what husbandman, when his vineyard is
desert and waste, will feel no anguish for it? What shepherd would be so harsh
and stern as, when his flock was perishing, to suffer nothing on its account?
These are the causes of My grief: for these things I am sorrowful. For I am
God, gentle, and that loves to spare. "I have no pleasure in the death of
a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his evil way and live."
Right therefore is it, most right, that as being good and merciful, I should
not only be glad at what is joyful, but also should feel sorrow at whatsoever
is grievous.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that He pitied Jerusalem, as being well aware of what was about to happen, and
that it would have to endure all <a name="p686"><font color="#000000">|686</font></a> misery because of its
crimes against Him, you may learn even from this. For He went up from Judaea to
Jerusalem, and, as the Evangelist says, "When He beheld the city, He wept
over it, and said, Would that you, even you, had known the things of your
peace; but now they are hid from your eyes." For as He wept over Lazarus,
in pity for the whole race of mankind, which had become the prey of corruption
and of death; so we say that He was grieved at seeing Jerusalem all but
involved in extreme miseries, and in calamities for which there was no cure.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that we might learn what was His wish concerning Israel, He told the disciples,
that He is in grief and anguish. For it would have been impossible for them to
have learnt what was hidden within Him, if He had not revealed by words what
His feelings were.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this too I think it necessary to add to what has been said: that the passion of
grief, or malady, as we may call it, of sore distress, cannot have reference to
the divine and impassive nature of the Word; for that is impossible, inasmuch
as It transcends all passion: but we say that the Incarnate Word willed also to
submit Himself to the measure of human nature, by being supposed to suffer what
belongs to it. As therefore He is said to have hungered, although He is Life
and the cause of life, and the living bread; and was weary also from a long journey,
although He is the Lord of powers; so also it is said that He was grieved, and
seemed to be capable of anguish. For it would not have been fitting for Him Who
submitted Himself to emptiness, and stood in the measure of human nature, to
have seemed unwilling to endure human things. The Word therefore of God the
Father is altogether free from all passion: but wisely and for the
dispensation's sake He submitted Himself to the infirmities of mankind, in
order that He might not seem to refuse that which the dispensation required:
yes, He even yielded obedience to human <a name="p687"><font color="#000000">|687</font></a> customs and laws,
only, as I said, He did not bear ought of this in His own nature.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is however much, yes, very much, to be added to what has been said; but for the

again I am come to pay you what I promised, and to add a fitting conclusion to
my discourse concerning Christ. For on all occasions it is dangerous to be
guilty of untruth; but when any thing of the kind is committed in those things
which are important for our edification, well may we then fear lest we bring
down upon us condemnation from on high, and also become an object of general
ridicule.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
said therefore at our last meeting, that Christ the Saviour of all was with the
holy disciples upon the mount of Olives, while that many-headed serpent, even
Satan, was preparing for Him the snare of death; and the chiefs of the Jewish
synagogue and the disciple that betrayed Him were, so to speak, leaving nothing
undone to gain possession of His person, and had already gathered those who
were to seize Him, and who consisted of a band of the soldiers of Pilate, and a
multitude of wicked officers. Just therefore as the attempt was about to be
made, He was sorrowful, and admonished the disciples to act in like manner
suitably to the season, saying, "Watch and pray, that you fall not into
temptation." And that He might not benefit them by words only, but be
Himself an example of what they should do, "having gone apart a little,
about a stone's throw, He knelt down, it says, and prayed, saying, Father, if
You be willing, remove this cup from Me." Now some one perhaps may ask,
'Why did He not pray with the holy disciples, but having gone apart from the
rest, prayed by Himself?' It was that we might learn the pattern of that mode
of prayer which is well pleasing to God. For it is not right when we pray that
we should expose ourselves to the public gaze, nor seek to be beheld of many,
lest perchance, sinking ourselves in the mire of endeavours after pleasing men,
we make the labour of our prayers altogether unprofitable. Of this fault the
scribes and Pharisees were guilty; for our Lord even once rebuked them for
loving to pray in the corners of the streets, and for the long <a name="p689"><font color="#000000">|689</font></a>
supplications which they offered in the synagogues, that they might be seen of
men. But for those whose purpose it is to live uprightly, and who are anxious
to hold fast by their love to Him, He lays down the law of prayers in these
words: "But you, when you pray, enter your chamber, and close your door,
and pray to your Father Who is in secret, and your Father Who sees in secret
shall reward you." Every where therefore we find Him praying alone, that
you also may learn that we ought to hold converse with God over all with a
quiet mind, and a heart calm and free from all disturbance. For the wise Paul
writes, "I will therefore that men pray, lifting up pious hands, without
wrath and doubtings."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
was praying therefore, when already those who were to seize Him were at the door.
And let no man of understanding say, that He offered these supplications as
being in need of strength or help from another:----for He is Himself the
Father's almighty strength and power:----but it was that we might hereby learn,
ever to put away from us carelessness when temptation harasses, and persecution
presses upon us, and perfidy contrives for us its snare, and makes ready the
net of death. For it is the very means of our salvation to watch and fall upon
our knees, and make constant supplications, and ask for the aid that comes from
above, lest perchance it be our lot to grow weak, and suffer a most terrible
shipwreck.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
spiritual bravery is indeed a thing right worthy of the saints: but those who
would resist the violence of temptations must, I tell you, have a determined
and, so to speak, an unflinching mind: for it is the act of utter ignorance to
be over confident in conflicts, nor is a man free from the charge of
boastfulness, who is thus disposed: we must therefore, I repeat, unite courage
and patience with humbleness of mind; and should any temptation then happen,
our mind will be prepared bravely to resist it. Yet let us ask of God the
ability to endure manfully: for we are commanded in our prayers to say,
"Lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil." <a name="p690"><font color="#000000">|690</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Behold
then, yes, see, the pattern for your conduct depicted for thee in Christ the
Saviour of us all: and let us also observe the manner of His prayer.
"Father, He says, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me." Do
you see that Christ made His prayer against temptation with a reverence
befitting man? "For if You be willing, He says, remove it." And here
too remember what the blessed Paul wrote concerning Him; "He Who in the
days of His flesh offered up prayers and supplications to Him Who was able to
save Him from death, with strong crying and tears, and was heard because of His
reverence, even though He was a Son, yet learned obedience by what He suffered,
and being made perfect became the cause of eternal life to all them that obey
Him." For as though one of us, He assigns to His Father's will the
carrying out of whatever was about to be done. And if therefore it happen that
we also at any time fall into unexpected troubles, and have to endure any
mental conflict, let us beseech God not so much that it may end according to
our will, but rather let us ask that whatever He knows to be fit and expedient
for the benefit of our souls may be brought to pass. "For we know not what
to pray for as we ought:" but He is a treasure house of every thing, and
to those who love Him He gives whatever is suitable for them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
what I have said is, I trust, useful for the benefit of you all; but if we must
further contrive some other explanation for the prayer, we may also say, that
it rebukes the wickedness of the Jews: and in what way let us now explain. You
have heard Christ say, "Father, if You will, remove this cup from
Me." Was then His passion an involuntary act? and was the necessity for
Him to suffer, or rather the violence of those who plotted against Him,
stronger than His own will? Not so, we say. For His passion was not an
involuntary act, though yet in another respect it was grievous, because it
implied the rejection and destruction of the synagogue of the Jews. For it was
not His will that Israel should be the murderer of its Lord, because by so
doing it would be exposed to utter condemnation, and become reprobate, and
rejected from having part in His gifts, and in the hope prepared for the
saints, whereas once it had been His people, and His only one, and His elect,
and adopted heir. For Moses said to <a name="p691"><font color="#000000">|691</font></a> them, "Behold,
the heavens and the earth are the Lord's your God: and you has the Lord chosen
out of all nations to be His people." It was right therefore that we
should clearly know, that through pity for Israel He would have put from Him
the necessity to suffer: but as it was not possible for Him not to endure the
passion, He submitted to it also, because God the Father so willed it with Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
come and let us examine further this also. 'Did the decree of God the Father,
and the will of the Son Himself, call Him as of necessity to His passion? And
if so, and what I have said be true, was it not a matter of necessity for some
one to be the traitor, and for the Israelites to proceed to such a pitch of
daring as to reject Christ, and put Him to shame in manifold ways, and contrive
for Him also the death upon the cross?' But if this were so, how would He be
found saying, "Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: good had
it been for him if he had not been born?" And what just cause would there
have been for Israel to perish, and be condemned to the miseries of war? For
how could it oppose God's decree, and His irresistible purposes? God is not
unjust, but weighs what we do with holy judgment. How therefore can He treat as
voluntary that which was involuntary? For God the Father had pity upon the
dwellers upon earth, who were in misery, caught in the snares of sin, and
liable to death and corruption; bowed also beneath a tyrant's hand, and
enslaved to herds of devils. He sent from heaven His Son to be a Saviour and
Deliverer: Who also was made in form like to us. But even though He foreknew
what He would suffer, and the shame of His passion was not the fruit of His own
will, yet He consented to undergo it that He might save the earth, God the
Father so willing it with Him, from His great kindness and love to mankind.
"For He so loved the world, that He gave even His Only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
As regards therefore the ignominy of His passion, He willed not to suffer: but
as it was not possible for Him not to suffer, because of the cruelty of the
Jews, and their disobedience, and unbridled violence, "He endured the
cross, despising the shame," "and was obedient to the Father, <a name="p692"><font color="#000000">|692</font></a> even to death, and that the death of the cross. But God, it
says, has greatly exalted Him, and given Him a name that is above every name;
that at the name of Jesus Christ every knee should bow of things in heaven, and
things in earth, and of things under the earth, and that every tongue should
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Amen. <a name="p693"><font color="#000000">|693</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>While He was speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one
of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him. For he had
given them this sign, Whomsoever I kiss is He. But Jesus said to him, Judas, do
you betray the Son of man with a kiss? But when they that were with Him saw
what was about to be done, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? And
one of them struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear.
But Jesus answered, and said, Let alone thus far. And He touched his ear and healed
him. And Jesus said to those who had come out against Him, and who were the
chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, Are you come out as
against a thief with swords and staves to take Me? When I was daily with you in
the temple, you stretched not out your hands against Me: but this is your hour,

and bitter passions wage war with the soul of man, and, attacking it with
unendurable violence, humble it to unseemly deeds: but worse than all the rest
is that root of all evil, the love of money, into whose inextricable nets that

this the purport of the evangelic lessons again plainly shows. For the Saviour
had forewarned the holy apostles that He should be seized, and endure by the
hand of sinners His passion upon the cross. And with this He also commanded,
that when temptation pressed upon them they must not be weary, nor sleep at an
unseasonable time, but rather must watch and be constant in prayers. When then
He was still speaking of these things, "Behold, it says, a multitude, and
he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them." Do you see
that the blessed Evangelist grieves, and, so to speak, <a name="p694"><font color="#000000">|694</font></a>
even faints? For he does not permit himself even to retain in his remembrance
the disciple who was so easily bought: he refuses even to name that wicked one:
for he says, "he that was called Judas." For what? did he not know
that the man was numbered with the elect, and counted in the company of the
holy apostles? But, as I have already said, he hated even his name, and
therefore the expression, "he that was called Judas."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">To
this, however, he adds, that he was one of the twelve: and this also is a
matter of great importance to demonstrate more fully the guilt of the traitor's
crime. For he who had been equally honoured with the rest, and adorned with
apostolic dignities; he, the elect and beloved, deigned admittance to the holy
table, and the highest honours, became the pathway and the means for the
murderers of Christ. What lamentation can suffice for him, or what floods of
tears must not each shed from his eyes, when he considers from what happiness
that wretched being fell into such utter misery! For the sake of worthless
pence he ceased to be with Christ, and lost his hope toward God, and the
honour, and crowns, and life, and glory prepared for Christ's true followers,
and the right of reigning with Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
will be worth while, however, to see what the nature was of his artifice. He
had given then those murderers a sign, saying, "Whomsoever I kiss is
He." Completely had he forgotten the glory of Christ, and in his utter
folly imagined perhaps that he could remain undetected when offering indeed a
kiss, which is the type of love, but with his heart full of bitter and
iniquitous deceit. And yet even when he was accompanying Christ our common
Saviour in His journeys with the other apostles, he often had heard Him
foretelling what was about to happen: for, as being God by nature, He knew all
things, and expressly told him of his treachery; for He said to the holy
apostles, "Verily I say to you, that one of you betrays Me." How then
could his purposes remain unknown? No: but there was the serpent within him
struggling against God; he was the dwelling-place of the devil: for one of the
holy evangelists has said, that as he was reclining at table with the rest of
the disciples, the Saviour gave him a piece of bread, having dipped it in the
dish: "and after the bread <a name="p695"><font color="#000000">|695</font></a> Satan entered into
him." He approaches Christ therefore as one beside himself with wine; and
though the instrument of fraud and treachery, he makes a show of extraordinary
affection: and therefore Christ very justly condemned him with the greater
severity, saying, "Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?"
And Matthew says, that when the traitor drew near to Christ, our common Saviour,
he both kissed Him, and added thereto, "Hail, Master." Do you say
hail to Him Who by your instrumentality is made the prey of death? How could
such a word possibly be true? So that we see, that inasmuch as that false one,
Satan, was within Him, he used falsehood even in saying, Hail. Because of such
deeds the prophet somewhere says, "Their tongue is a piercing spearhead:
the words of their mouth are deceitful: to his neighbour he speaks things of
peace, but in his soul there is enmity."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
further, we must also call to mind what is written by the divine John
respecting this event; for he has related, "that the officers of the Jews
drew near to seize Jesus: and He advanced to meet them, saying, Whom seek you?
When then the officers said, Jesus of Nazareth, He yielded Himself into the
hands of those murderers, saying, I am He. But they, it says, went back; and
this happened three times." What therefore was the purpose of this? and
for what reason did the Saviour offer Himself to them, but they fell down when
they heard Him say, "I am He?" It was that they might learn that His
passion did not happen to Him without His own will, nor could they have seized
Him, had He not consented to be taken. For it was not the effect of their own
strength that they took Christ, and brought Him to the wicked rulers, but He
yielded Himself up to suffer, as well knowing that His passion upon the cross
was for the salvation of the whole world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
the blessed disciples, pricked with the goading of divine love, drew their
swords to repel the attack. But Christ would not permit this to be done, but
rebuked Peter, saying, "Put up your sword into its sheath: for all who
have taken swords shall die by swords." And herein He has given us also a
pattern of the manner in which we must hold fast by our love to Him, and of the
extent to which the burning zeal of our <a name="p696"><font color="#000000">|696</font></a> piety may
proceed. For He would not have us use swords wherewith to resist our enemies,
but rather employing love and prudence, we so must mightily prevail over those
who oppose us. And similarly Paul teaches us, saying, "Casting down
reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of
God, and bringing captive every thought to obedience to Him." For the war
for truth's sake is spiritual, and the panoply that becomes saints is
intellectual, and full of love to God. "For we must put on the breastplate
of righteousness, and the helmet of salvation; and take the shield of faith,
and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." And so then the
Saviour moderates the unmeasured heat of the holy apostles: and by preventing
the example of such an act, declares that those who are the chief in His
religion have no need in any way whatsoever of swords. And He healed with
divine dignity him who had received the blow, so giving to those who came to
seize Him this godlike sign also for their condemnation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
that no one prevailed by force over His power and will, He shows by saying;
"Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves to take Me?
When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched not out your hands
against Me." Does Christ then blame the chiefs of the Jews for not having
prematurely contrived for Him the deadly snare? Not such is His meaning, but
this rather: when it was easy for you to take Me, as each day I taught in the
temple, you seized Me not. And why? Because I did not will as yet to suffer,
but rather was waiting for a fitting season for My passion. And this season has
now arrived: for be not ignorant that "this is your hour and the power of
darkness:" that is, that a short time is granted you during which you have
power over Me. But how has it been given you, and in what manner? By the will
of the Father consenting thereunto with My will. For I willed that for the
salvation and life of the world I should submit Myself to My passion. You have
therefore one hour against Me, that is a very short and limited time, being
that between the precious cross and the resurrection from the dead. And this
too is the power given to darkness: but darkness is the name of Satan, for he
is utter night and darkness, and the blessed Paul also says of him. "that
the God of this world <a name="p697"><font color="#000000">|697</font></a> has blinded the minds of those that
believe not, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ should shine to
them." Power therefore was granted to Satan and the Jews to rise up
against Christ: but they dug for themselves the pitfall of destruction. For He
indeed saved by means of His passion all under heaven, and rose the third day,
having trampled under foot the empire of death: but they brought down upon
their own heads inevitable condemnation in company with that traitorous
disciple. Let them hear therefore the Holy Spirit, Who says by the voice of the
Psalmist, "Why have the heathen raged, and the nations meditated vain
things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together
against the Lord and against His Christ." But what follows this? "He
that dwells in heaven, it says, shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall deride
them." These wretched beings then involved themselves in the crime of
murdering their Lord; but we praise as our Saviour and Deliverer our Lord Jesus
Christ: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion, with
the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p698"><font color="#000000">|698</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And they took Him, and led Him away, and brought Him into the high priest's
house: and Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the
midst of the court, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them: and
a certain maid beholding him as he sat at the light, looked earnestly at him
and said, this man also was with Him. But he denied Him, saying, Woman, 1 know
Him not. And after a little while another saw him, and said, You also are one
of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about the space of an hour after,
another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with Him:
for he is a Galilaean. But Peter said, Man, I know not what you say. And
immediately while he was yet speaking the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and
looked upon Peter: and Peter remembered the word of the Lord that He had said
to him, To-day before the cock crow you shall deny Me thrice. And he went out
and wept bitterly.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">OUR,
Lord Jesus Christ, to make us careful in whatever holy occupations we
undertake, commanded us to offer up our supplications continually, and to make
it a portion of our prayer to say, "Lead us not into temptation." For
the violence of temptations is often sufficient to shake even a thoroughly
steadfast mind, and to humble to wavering, and expose to extreme terrors even a
courageous and strong-hearted man. And this it was the lot of the chosen
disciple to experience, by whom I mean the sacred Peter. For he proved weak,
and denied Christ the Saviour of all. And this denial he made not once only,
but thrice, and with oaths. For Matthew has said, that "he began to curse
and to swear, I know not the Man." Now there are some who would have us
believe that what the disciple swore was, that he did not know that Jesus was a
man: but their argument fails them, <a name="p699"><font color="#000000">|699</font></a> though their object
was to give the disciple loving help. For if he swore, as they say, that he did
not know that Jesus was a man, what else did he than deny Him in thus
overturning the mystery of the dispensation in the flesh? For he knew that the
Only-begotten Word of God was made like to us, that is, a man: for this he
openly confessed, saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living
God." Now he did not intend in saying this to affirm, that as being one
merely such as we are He is the Son of God, but that though he saw Him standing
there in the limits of human nature,----Him Who is the Word Which transcends
everything that is made, and Who sprung forth from the Substance of God the
Father,----even so, I say, he did not shrink from acknowledging and confessing
that He is the Son of the living God. It is therefore a thing-very absurd to
suppose, that though he knew the mystery of the dispensation in the flesh, he
yet said that he did not know that Jesus was a man. What therefore is the fact?
He was really infirm: for it was not possible for Jesus to speak falsely, Who
forewarned him, that "before the cock crow you shall deny Me three
times."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Nor
verily do we say, that the denial took place in order that Christ's words might
come true, but rather that His object was to forewarn the disciple, inasmuch as
what was about to happen did not escape His knowledge. The misfortune therefore
happened to the disciple from the cowardice of human nature. For as Christ had
not yet risen from the dead, nor death as yet been abolished, and corruption
wiped away, the fear of undergoing death was a thing past men's endurance. For
that this miserable act arose, as I said, from the malady of human cowardice,
and that the disciple was condemned by his own conscience, is proved both by
his lamentation immediately afterwards, and by his tears upon his repentance,
which fell from his eyes as for a grievous sin. "For having gone out, it
says, he wept bitterly," after Christ had looked upon him, and recalled to
his remembrance what He had said to him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
next, it is worth our while observing, in what way his sin was forgiven, and
how he put away his fault; for the event may prove of no slight benefit to us
also ourselves. He did not then defer his repentance, nor was he careless about
<a name="p700"><font color="#000000">|700</font></a> it: for as rapid as was his descent into sin, so quick
were his tears because of it; nor did he merely weep, but wept bitterly; and as
one that had fallen, so bravely did he spring up again. For he knew that the
merciful God somewhere says by one of the prophets, "Shall not he that
falls arise? and he that backslides, shall he not return?" In returning
therefore he missed not the mark: for he continued to be what he had been
before, a true disciple. For when he was warned that he should thrice deny
before the cock crow, even then he won also the hope of forgiveness: for
Christ's words to him were, "And do you also, in time to come, when you
are converted, strengthen your brethren." Words such as these belong to
One Who again appoints and restores him to apostolic powers: for He entrusts
him again with the office of strengthening the brethren; a thing which also he
did.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this too we say; that though we are taught the failures of the saints in the sacred
Scriptures, it is not that we may be caught in similar snares from disregarding
the duty of steadfastness, but that if it do chance that we prove weak in
anything that is necessary for salvation, we may not despair of being able once
again to mount up to fortitude, and, so to speak, recover our health after an
unexpected illness. For the merciful God has provided for the inhabitants of
earth repentance as the medicine of salvation: and this I know not how men </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_14_sermons_146_156.htm#1" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>1</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> endeavour to dispense with, saying of themselves that they
are clean, and in their great madness not understanding, that to entertain such
an idea of themselves is full of all impurity. For "no man is free from
defilement," as it is written. And besides this we say, that it makes God
angry for us to imagine that we are free from all impurity: for He is even
found saying to one of those who led polluted lives, "Behold I have a
lawsuit with you because you say I have not sinned, in that you have acted very
contemptuously in repeating your ways." For the repetition of the way to
sin is for us, when we are overtaken by offences, to refuse to believe that we
are guilty of the defilement which arises from them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">'But
yes, verily! they say, the God of all pardons the sins <a name="p701"><font color="#000000">|701</font></a> of
those who are not as yet baptized, but not so of those who have been already
admitted to His grace.' And what do we say to this? That if they lay down laws
according to their own fancy, their words do not much concern us. But if they
cleave to the divinely-inspired Scriptures, when was the God of all unmerciful?
Let them hear Him when He cries aloud, "Tell you your former iniquities,
that you may be justified." Let them also call to mind the blessed David,
who says in the Psalms, "Shall God forget to be merciful: or shall He
gather up His mercies in His wrath?" And again, "I said, I will
acknowledge against myself my iniquity to the Lord: and You forgave the
wickedness of my heart." And besides this, they ought not to forget that
before Christ was seized, or Peter denied Him, he had been a partaker of the
body of Christ, and of His precious blood. "For He took bread and blessed,
and gave to them, saying, This is My body. And in like manner also of the cup,
saying, Drink you all of it: for this is My blood of the new covenant."
Behold then, manifestly, that after having been a partaker of the mystical
eucharist, he fell into sin, and received forgiveness upon his repentance. Let
them then not find fault with the gentleness of God: let them not think scorn
of His love to mankind, but call to mind Him Who plainly says, "The
wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him in the day wherein he turns away
from his iniquity." And when God thus offers us conversion on whatever day
a man be willing to practise it, why do they not rather crown with grateful
praises Him Who aids them, instead of foolishly, and, so to say, contumaciously
opposing Him? for by so doing they bring condemnation upon their own heads, and
call down upon themselves inevitable wrath. For the merciful God does not cease
to be so; since, according to the voice of the prophet, "He wills
mercy.'" Let us therefore strive with all our might, lest we fall into <a name="p702"><font color="#000000">|702</font></a> sin, and lot a steadfast love to Christ be fixed
unchangeably in us while we say in the words of the blessed Paul, "Who
shall separate me from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress, or
persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? But if temptation assail
us, and so it chance that we prove but weak, let us weep bitterly; let us ask
forgiveness of God: for He heals those that are contrite; He raises up the
fallen; He stretches out His saving hand to those who have gone astray: for He
is the Saviour of all, by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and
dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p703"><font color="#000000">|703</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

And many other things blasphemously spoke they against Him. And when it was
day, the council of the elders of the people, composed of the chief priests and
scribes, came together, and they led Him into their assembly: and they said, If
You are the Christ, tell us. And He said to them, If I tell you, you will not

too let the prophet Jeremiah say of the race of Israel, "Who will grant
for my head to be waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I may weep for
this people day and night?" For what lamentation can suffice for those who
fell into the pit of destruction because of their wicked conduct to Christ, and
for guilt so great, that not with words only did they grieve Him, and mock Him
with blasphemous cries, but even laid sinful hands upon Him, and made ready for
Him the snare of death? And so contumeliously did they treat him, wickedly
making Him their sport, as even to venture to smite Him: for so we have this
day heard the holy evangelist say, "For the men who held Him mocked and
struck Him, saying, Prophesy, who is he that struck You?" "But He,
when He was reviled, reviled not again: and when He suffered, He threatened
not, but committed His cause to Him that judges righteously." Well
therefore might we utter that which was said of certain men by one of the holy
prophets, "The heavens were astonished thereat, and shuddered very
greatly, says the Lord." For the Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator and
Artificer of all, the King of kings and Lord of lords, Who is of such
surpassing greatness in glory and majesty, the foundation of everything, and
that in which <a name="p704"><font color="#000000">|704</font></a> it exists and abides----"for all
things exist in Him"----He Who is the breath of all the holy spirits in
heaven, is scorned like one of us, and patiently endures buffetings, and
submits to the ridicule of the wicked, offering Himself to us as a perfect
pattern of longsuffering, or rather manifesting the incomparable greatness of
His godlike gentleness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Or
perhaps even He thus endures to rebuke the infirmity of our minds, and show
that the things of men fall as far below the divine excellencies as our nature
is inferior to His. For we who are of earth, mere corruption and ashes, attack
at once those who would molest us, having a heart full of fierceness like
savage beasts. But He, Who in nature and glory transcends the limits of our
understanding and our powers of speech, patiently endured those officers when
they not merely mocked, but even struck Him. "For when they had
blindfolded Him, it says, and afterwards struck Him, they asked Him, Prophesy,
who is he that struck You?" They ridicule, as if He were some ignorant
person, Him Who is the Giver of all knowledge, and Who even sees what is hidden
within us: for He has somewhere said by one of the holy prophets, "Who is
this that hides from Me counsel, and shuts up words in his heart, and thinks
that from Me he hides them? He therefore Who tries hearts and reins, and Who is
the Giver of all prophecy, how could He not know who it was that struck Him?
But as Christ Himself said, "Darkness has blinded their eyes, and their
minds are blinded." Of them too therefore may one say, "Woe to them
that are drunken, but not with wine!" "For their vine is of the vine
of Sodom, and their tendril of Gomorrah."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
when at the dawn of day their wicked assembly was gathered together, He Who is
the Lord of Moses, and the Sender of the prophets, after having been thus
lawlessly mocked, was brought into the midst; and they asked if He were the
Christ? O senseless Pharisee, if you ask because you know not, surely until you
had learnt the truth you ought in no wise to have grieved Him, lest haply you
should grieve God: but if you make pretence of ignorance, while really you know
well that He is the Christ, you must hear what the sacred Scripture says,
"God is not deceived." <a name="p705"><font color="#000000">|705</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
tell me, why do you question Him, and wish to learn of Himself, whether He be
the Christ? For it is easy enough to obtain the knowledge of Him from the law
and the prophets. Search the writings of Moses: you will see Him depicted there
in manifold ways. For He was sacrificed as a lamb: He vanquished the destroyer
by His blood: and was prefigured also in many other forms. Examine too the writings
of the prophets; you will hear them proclaiming His divine and wonderful
miracles. "For then, they say, shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and
the ears of the dumb shall hear: then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and
the tongue of the stammerers shall be plain." And again, "The dead
shall arise, and those who are in the graves shall awake: for the dew from You
is healing to them." Since therefore even you yourselves see the perfect
clearness of the accomplishment of the prophecies respecting Him, why do you
not rather acknowledge Him on the evidence of His divine miracles, and of His
ineffable works? And this too Christ Himself said to you; "The works which
My Father gave Me to do, those works bear witness of Me that He sent Me."
And again, "If I had not done among them the works which no other man did,
they had not had sin: but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My
Father." The rulers therefore of the Jews, together with the people under
their charge, were in very truth unbelieving, and thoroughly without
understanding.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">I
think, however, that we ought to examine the words used by Christ: for they
were a reproof of the want of love to God of which the Scribes and Pharisees
were guilty. When therefore they ask whether He is in truth the Christ, and
would learn this very thing, He says, "If I tell you, you will not
believe; and if I ask, you will not return an answer." Come therefore, and
let me explain to you, as to men glad to be taught, what the occasion was on
which they heard, and would not believe; and that on which they were silent
when questioned. When Christ then went up to Jerusalem, He found in the temple
people selling sheep and oxen and doves, and moneychangers sitting: and having
made, it says, a kind of scourge of cords, He drove them all out of the temple,
saying, "Take these things hence: and make not My Father's house <a name="p706"><font color="#000000">|706</font></a> a house of merchandize." Because therefore He called
God His Father, those who were sacrificing in the temple murmured and attacked
Him, saying, "By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You
this authority?" And to this Christ replied, "I will also ask you a
word, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these
things. The baptism of John, whence was it, from heaven, or from men? And they,
it says, reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say
to us, Why did you not believe him? But if we say, Of men, we fear the
multitude: for all held John as a prophet. And they answered and said, We do
not know. And Christ said thereto, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do
these things."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
on another occasion He asked them, saying, "What say you of Christ? Whose
Son is He? And they said, David's. And afterwards the Lord said to them, How
therefore does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to my Lord,
Sit You on My right hand, until I place Your enemies as a footstool under Your
feet. If therefore David call Him Lord, how is He his Son?" And to this
again they were silent. You see that Christ speaks truly when He says,
"And if I ask you, you will not return Me an answer."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

shall see too that the other declaration is equally true: and what is this?
"If I tell you, you will not believe." For the blessed John the
Evangelist writes, that "it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem,
and it was winter: and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch. The
Jews therefore came round about Him, and said to Him, How long will You lift up
our soul? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. And Jesus answered them, I
told you, and you will not believe: the works that I do in My Father's name,
they bear witness of Me; but you will not believe."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
to make their condemnation more severe, in respect, I mean, of their refusing
to believe on Him, He further clearly sets before them His glory, saying,
"But hereafter the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of
God." When, He says, I was in form like to you, though by nature and in <a name="p707"><font color="#000000">|707</font></a> truth the Son of God the Father, you made no account of Me.
And yet how was it not right that the excellent art of the dispensation in the
flesh should not escape your notice, inasmuch as you are learned in the law,
and nurtured in the writings of Moses, nor are the predictions of the holy
prophets unknown to you. But since you have brought yourselves to so great want
of knowledge, and being filled with utter ignorance, recognise not the mystery
concerning Me, I tell you of necessity that there is granted you but a short
and narrow season for your pride and wickedness against Me, even until My
precious cross. For immediately after this I clothe Myself in honour: I ascend
to the glory which I had from the beginning: I am made even in the flesh the
partner of God the Father on His throne, and possess sovereignty over all, even
though I have taken upon Me your likeness. When Christ was thus speaking, the
troop of Pharisees was inflamed with uncontrollable wrath: they catch at the
expression as a pretext for blasphemy, and accuse the truth itself: they say,
that "no longer need we any testimony,"<sup> </sup>as being
themselves the hearers of His words. And what then had they heard Him say? O
vile and senseless men, you wanted to learn whether He were the Christ: He
taught you therefore that by nature and in truth He is the Son of God the
Father, and with Him shares the throne of Deity. Therefore, as you confessed,
henceforth you have no need of testimony, for you have heard Him speak: hence
might you best have learnt that He is the Christ: and this would have proved
for you the pathway to faith, had you only been one of those who would know the
truth. But they, making even the pathway of salvation an occasion for their
souls' ruin, understand not: senselessly they slay Him, keeping but one aim in
view in contempt of all law, and utter disregard of the divine commands: for it
is written, "The holy and the just you shall not kill." But they, as
I said, paid no regard whatsoever to the sacred commands, but rushed down, as
it were, some steep descent, to fall into the snares of destruction.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

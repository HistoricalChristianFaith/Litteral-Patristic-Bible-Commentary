<i>And He spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his
vineyard, and he came and sought fruit thereon, but found none. Then said he
unto the dresser of his vineyard, Lo, three years indeed I come seeking fruit
on this fig-tree, and find none. Out it down therefore: why does it make the
ground also barren? But he answered and said unto him, Lord, let it alone this
year also: until I dig around it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit in the
coming </i>[<i>year, well</i>], <i>and if not, you shall cut it down.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">THE
Psalmist shows the surpassing gentleness of Christ, the Saviour of us all, in
these words; "Lord, what is man, that You art mindful of him, or the son
of man, that You visit him?" For man upon earth, as far as his bodily
nature is concerned, is dust and ashes: but he has been honoured by God, by
having been made in His image and likeness: not in his bodily shape, that is,
but rather because he is capable of being just and good, and fitted for all
virtue. The Creator therefore takes care of him, as being His creature, and for
the purpose of adorning the earth. For as the prophet Isaiah says; "He
made it not in vain, but that it should be inhabited:"----inhabited of
course by a rational animal, who can discern with the eyes of the mind the
Creator and Artificer of the Universe, and glorify Him like the spirits that
are above. Put because by the deceiving arts of the serpent he had turned aside
unto wickedness, and was held fast by the chains of sin, and removed far from
God, Christ, to enable him <a name="p447"><font color="#000000">|447</font></a> once again to mount upwards,
has sought him out, and fashioned him anew to what he was at first, and granted
him repentance as the pathway to lead him unto salvation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
proposes therefore a wise parable: but we ought perhaps first to explain what
was the occasion which led to it, or what at all the necessity why He brought
it forward.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">There
were therefore certain who told Christ, the Saviour of us all, that Pilate had
put to death cruelly and without pity certain Galilaeans, and mingled their
blood with their sacrifices. And others that the tower near Shiloh had fallen,
and eighteen persons perished beneath the ruins. And afterwards referring to
these things, Christ had said to His hearers; "Verily, I say unto you,
that except you repent, you also shall in like manner perish." This was
the head and root of the present parable, and that at which it was, as it were,
aimed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
the outer sense of this passage needs not a single word for its explanation:
but when we search into its inward and secret and unseen purport, it is, we
affirm, as follows. The Israelites, after our Saviour's crucifixion, were
doomed to fall into the miseries they deserved, Jerusalem being captured, and
its inhabitants slaughtered by the sword of the enemy. Nor were they to perish
thus only, but their houses were to be burnt with fire, and even the temple of
God demolished. It is probable therefore that He likens the synagogue of the
Jews to a fig tree; for the sacred Scripture also compares them to various plants:
to the vine, for instance, and the olive, and even to a forest. For the prophet
Jeremiah at one time says of Jerusalem, or rather of its inhabitants;
"Israel is a vine with many branches." And again at another
addressing it, he says; "The Lord has called your name a beautiful olive
tree, well shaded in appearance: at its pruning time a fire was kindled in it:
great was the tribulation that was upon it; its branches were destroyed."
And another of the holy prophets, comparing it to Mount Lebanon, thus speaks;
"Open your doors, O Lebanon, and the fire shall devour your cedars."
For the forest that was in Jerusalem, even the people there, many as they were
and innumerable, was destroyed as by fire. He takes therefore, as I said, the
fig tree spoken of in the parable as a figure of the Jewish synagogue, that is,
of the Israelites: and "three years," He says, "He <a name="p448"><font color="#000000">|448</font></a>
sought fruit upon it, and found none." By which, I think, are signified to
us those three periods during which the Jewish synagogue bore no fruit. The
first of these, one may say, was that in which Moses and Aaron and his sons
lived: who served God, holding the office of the priesthood according to the
law. The second was the period of Jeshua, the son of Nun, and the judges who
succeeded him. And the third, that in which the blessed prophets flourished
down to the time of John the Baptist During these periods Israel brought forth
no fruit.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
I can imagine persons making to this the following objection; 'But lo! it did
fulfil the service ordained by the law, and offered the sacrifices which
consisted in the blood of victims and burning incense.' But to this we reply:
that in the writings of Moses there was only a type of the truth, and a gross
and material service: there was not as yet a service simple, pure, and
spiritual, such as we affirm God chiefly loves, having so learnt of Christ, Who
said; "God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in
spirit and truth." As far therefore as regarded the good-will of the
Father, and evidently that also of the Son, the service which consisted in
shadows and types was unacceptable, being utterly without fruit in whatsoever
appertains to a sweet spiritual savour. And therefore it was rejected: for so
the Saviour teaches us, when saying to God the Father in heaven;
"Sacrifice and offering You would not: and whole burnt offerings, and sin
offerings You did not require." And again by the voice of Isaiah He says
Himself to those who were seeking to fulfil it: "For who has required this
at your hands? Tread My court no more: if you bring fine meal, it is in vain:
incense is an abomination unto Me." How therefore can that which God hates
and abominates be supposed to be the rational and spiritual fruit of the soul,
and acceptable unto Him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
says therefore, "Lo, three years do I come seeking fruit on this fig tree,
and find none. Cut it down therefore: why does it make the ground also
useless." As though He would say, Let the place of this barren fig tree be
laid bare: for then there will come up or may be planted there some other tree.
And this too was done:. for the multitude of the Gentiles was summoned into its
room, and took possession of <a name="p449"><font color="#000000">|449</font></a> the inheritance of the
Israelites. It became the people of God; the plant of Paradise; a germ good and
honourable; that knows how to bring forth fruit, not in shadows and types, but
rather by a pure and perfectly stainless service, even that which is in spirit
and in truth, as being offered to God, Who is an immaterial Being.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
owner then of the ground said, that the fig-tree, which during so long a time
had been barren and without fruit, must be cut down. But the vinedresser, it
says, besought him, saying; "Lord, let it alone this year also: until I
dig around it and dung it: and if it bear fruit in the coming [year, well;] and
if not, you shall cut it down."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
it is necessary to inquire, who is to be understood by the vinedresser. If then
any one choose to affirm that it is the angel who was appointed by God as the
guardian of the synagogue of the Jews, he would not miss a suitable
interpretation. For we remember that the prophet Zechariah wrote, that one of
the holy angels stood offering supplications for Jerusalem, and saying, "O
Lord Almighty, how long will You not have mercy upon Jerusalem, and on the cities
of Judah; which You have abandoned, lo! for seventy years?" And it is
written also in Exodus, that when the ruler of the land of the Egyptians with
his warriors was pursuing after the Israelites, and was already upon the point
of engaging with them in battle, the angel of God stood between the camp of the
Israelites and of the Egyptians, and the one came not near the other all the
night. There is therefore nothing unbefitting in supposing here also, that the
holy angel who was the guardian of the synagogue offered supplications in its
behalf, and prayed for a respite, if perchance yielding to better influence it
might yet bring forth fruit.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
if any one should say that the vinedresser is the Son, this view also, has a
reason on its side not unbefitting right arguments. For "He is our
Advocate with the Father," "and our propitiation," and the
husbandman of our souls, Who prunes away constantly whatever is to our hurt,
and fills us with rational and holy seeds, that so we may bring forth for Him
fruits: and so He spoke of Himself. " A sower went out to sow his
seed."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
it in no respect militates against the glory of the <a name="p450"><font color="#000000">|450</font></a> Son,
that He assumes the character of the vinedresser: for the leather is Himself
also found to have taken it, without being exposed to any blame for so doing.
For the Son said to the holy apostles, " I am the Vine: you are the
branches: My Father is the Husbandman." For the verbal expression must
from time to time be made to accord with the suppositions which are laid down.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
Him therefore be supposed to be the Advocate in our behalf: and He says,
"Let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and dung it." And
what then is this year? But plainly this fourth year, this time subsequent to
those former periods, is that in which the Only-begotten Word of God became
man, to stir up like some husbandman by spiritual exhortations the Israelites
who had withered away in sin, digging round them, and warning them, to make
them "fervent in spirit." For He repeatedly denounced against them destruction
and ruin, wars and slaughters, burnings and captivities, and immitigable wrath:
while, on the other hand, He promised, if they would believe on Him, and now at
length become fruitful trees, that he would give them life and glory, the grace
of adoption, the communion of the Holy Spirit, and the kingdom of heaven. But
Israel was incapable of being taught even thus. It was still a barren fig tree,
and continued so to be. It was cut down, therefore, that it might not make the
ground useless: and in its stead there sprung up, as a fertile plant, the
gentile church, beautiful, and fruit-bearing, deeply-rooted, and incapable of
being shaken. For they have been counted as children unto Abraham, and have
been ingrafted into the good olive-tree: for a root has been preserved, and
Israel has not utterly perished.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that it was doomed to be cut down, on account of its utter barrenness, the

there was a woman, who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years.</span></i></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
there was in the synagogue a woman who for eighteen years was bowed down by
infirmity. And her case may prove of no little benefit to those who have
understanding: for we must gather what is to our advantage from every
quarter:----since by what happened to her we may see that Satan often receives
authority over certain persons, such, namely, as fall into sin, and have grown
lax in their efforts after piety. Whomsoever therefore he gets into his power,
he involves, it may be, in bodily diseases, since he delights in punishment and
is merciless. And the opportunity for this the all-seeing God most wisely
grants him, that being sore vexed by the burden of their misery, men may sot
themselves upon changing to a better course. For which reason St. Paul also
delivered over to Satan a certain person at Corinth accused of fornication,
"for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved."
The woman therefore who was bowed down is said to have suffered this from the
cruelty of the devil, according to our Master's words, "Whom Satan has
bound for eighteen years:" God, as I said, so permitting it, either for
her own sins, or rather by the operation of a universal and general law. For
the accursed Satan is the cause of disease to the bodies of men, inasmuch as
Adam's transgression was, we affirm, his doing, and by means of it our human
frames have become liable to infirmity and decay. But when this was the state
of men. God, Who by His very nature is good, did not abandon us when suffering
under the punishment of a protracted and incurable malady, but freed us from
our bonds, revealing as the glorious remedy for the sufferings of mankind His
own presence and manifestation in the world. For He came to fashion our state
again to what it was originally: for "God, as it is written, made not
death: neither has He pleasure in the destruction of the living. For He created
all things that they might have their being; and healthful were the generations
of the world; and there is in them no <a name="p452"><font color="#000000">|452</font></a> poison of
destruction," " but by the envy of the devil death entered into the
world."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Incarnation of the Word, and His assumption of human nature took place for the
overthrow of death and destruction, and of that envy nourished against us by
the wicked serpent, who was the first cause of evil. And this is plainly proved
to us by facts themselves. And so He set free the daughter of Abraham from her
protracted sickness, calling out and saying, "Woman, you are loosed from
your infirmity." A speech most worthy of God, and full of supernatural
power: for with the kingly inclination of His will He drives away the disease.
And He also lays His hands upon her: and immediately, it says, she was made
straight. And hence too it is possible to sec that His holy flesh bore in it
the power and activity of God. For it was His own flesh, and not that of some
other Son beside Him, distinct and separate from Him, as some </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_09_sermons_89_98.htm#4" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>4</u></span></sup></a><sup><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> </span></sup><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">most

the sabbath day, &amp;c.</span></i></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
yet how ought he not rather to have wondered at Christ's having freed from her
bonds this daughter of Abraham? You have seen her unexpectedly delivered from
her misfortune: you were an eyewitness that the Physician prayed not, nor
received as a boon from another the healing of the sick woman; but that He
wrought it as a deed of power. As being the ruler of a synagogue, you know, I
suppose, the writings of Moses. You saw him praying upon every occasion, and
working nothing whatsoever by his own power. For when Mariam was struck with
leprosy, for having merely spoken something against him in the way of reproach,
and that true, "for he had taken, she says, unto himself an Ethiopian
wife," Moses could not overcome the disease, but, on the contrary, fell
down before God, saying, "O God, I beseech You, heal her." And not
even so, though he besought it, was the penalty of her sin remitted her. And
each one of the holy prophets, if anywhere at all they wrought any miracle, is
seen to <a name="p453"><font color="#000000">|453</font></a> have done it by the power of God. But here
observe, 1 pray, that Christ, the Saviour of all, offers no prayer, but refers
the accomplishment of the matter to His own power, healing her by a word and
the touch of the hand. For being Lord and God, He manifested His own flesh as
of equal efficacy with Himself for the deliverance of men from their diseases.
And hence it was intended that men should understand the purport of the mystery
concerning Him. Had therefore the ruler of the synagogue been a man of
understanding, he would have perceived Who and how great the Saviour was from
so wonderful a miracle, nor would he have talked in the same ignorant manner as
the multitudes, nor have accused those occupied with healing of a breach of the
law respecting the traditional abstinence from labour on the sabbath day.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">'But
plainly to heal is to labour.' Is the law then broken when God shows mercy even
on the sabbath day? Whom did He command to desist from labour? Himself? or was
it not rather you? If Himself, let His providence over us cease on the sabbath:
let the sun rest from his daily course; let the rains not fall; let the springs
of waters, and the streams of ever-flowing rivers, and the winds be still: but
if He commanded you to rest, blame not God because with power He has shown
mercy on any even on the sabbath. And why did He command men at all to rest
upon the sabbath? It was, you art told, that your manservant, and your ox, and
your horse, and all your cattle might rest. When therefore He gives men rest by
freeing them from their diseases, and you forbidd it, plainly you break the law
of the sabbath, in not permitting those to rest who are suffering under
sickness and disease, and whom Satan had bound.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the ruler of the unthankful synagogue, when he saw the woman whose limbs were
crippled, and her body bent and crooked even to the ground, receiving mercy
from Christ, and made perfectly upright by the touch alone of His hand, and
walking with that erect gait which becomes man, and magnifying God for her
deliverance, is vexed thereat, and burning with rage against the glory of the
Lord, is entangled in envy, and calumniates the miracle; nevertheless he passes
by our Lord, Who would have exposed his hypocrisy, and rebukes the multitudes,
that his indignation might seem to be aroused for the <a name="p454"><font color="#000000">|454</font></a>
sake of the sabbath day. But his object really was to prevail upon those who
were dispersed throughout the week, and occupied with their labours, not to be
spectators and admirers of the miracles of the Lord upon the sabbath, lest ever
they also should believe.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

commanding you to abstain on the sabbath day from all manual labour? Does it
forbid the labour of the mouth and speaking? Abstain then from eating and
drinking, and conversing, and singing psalms on the sabbath. But if you abstain
from these things, and do not even read the law, what good is the sabbath to
you? If however you confine the prohibition to manual labour, how is the
healing of a woman by a word a manual labour? But if you call it an act because
the woman was actually healed, you also perform an act in blaming her healing.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

do not you also unloose your girdle on the sabbath? Do not you put off your
shoes, and make your bed, and cleanse your hands when dirtied with eating? Why
then are you so angry at the single word "you art loosed?" And at
what work did the woman labour after the word was spoken? Did she set about the
craft of the brazier, or the carpenter, or the mason? Did she that very day
begin weaving or working at the loom? 'No. She was made straight, he says. It
was the healing absolutely that is a labour.' But no! you are not really angry
on account of the sabbath: but because you see Christ honoured, and worshipped
as God, you are frantic and choked with rage, and pine with envy. You have one
thing concealed in your heart, and profess and make pretext of another; for

comparison is an excellent one, and most fit to set before them what took place
and happened at the divine and sacred preaching of the Gospel, to which He here
gives the name of the kingdom of heaven; because it is through it that we gain
the right of sharing Christ's kingdom. At first then it was addressed to few
persons, and within a narrow range, but afterwards it widened its influence,
and spread abroad unto all nations. For at first it was spoken in Judaea only,
where also the blessed disciples were very few in number: but when Israel
disobeyed, the commandment was given to the holy apostles, "having gone to
make disciples of all the nations, &amp;c." As therefore a grain of
mustard seed is far <a name="p457"><font color="#000000">|457</font></a> inferior in size to the seeds of
other plants, but shoots up to a great height, far beyond what is usual among
herbs, so as for it even to become the lodging of many sparrows, so also the
kingdom of heaven, even the new and sacred preaching of salvation, by which we
are guided into every good work, and learn Him Who both by nature and verily is
God, being at first addressed to but few persons, and as it were small and
limited, shot up afterwards into rapid growth, and became the refuge of those
who fled to it for shelter, and who may be compared to sparrows, because human
things are but of small measure in comparison with God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this the letter of the Mosaic law has signified to us in an enigma: for it runs
thus, "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, You shall make unto thyself

afterwards, "And the priests, the sons of Aaron, shall sound the trumpets,

are intended to understand both the preparatory training of the law, and the
perfectness attained to in Christ by the gospel mode of life, and the teaching
which surpasses shadows and types. The law then is a trumpet, and equally so is
the saving preaching of the Gospel; for by this name does the prophet Isaiah
also make mention of it, saying, "And it shall come to pass on that day
that they shall sound with the great trumpet," For in very deed a great
trumpet sounded forth by the voice of the holy apostles, not setting at nought
the first [trumpet], but </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_09_sermons_89_98.htm#5" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>5</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> [<i>Sermon 98 restarts here</i>]<a name="Sermon98"></a>containing

were then two trumpets made of beaten silver, in which the silver signifies
splendour; for every word of God is <a name="p458"><font color="#000000">|458</font></a> glorious, having in
it none of the darkness of the world: and the hammering out of the metal showed
that the sacred and divine trumpet, that is, both the old and new preaching,
would advance and grow onward: for that which is hammered out advances as it
were continually onward, and extends in breadth and length. "For at
Christ's rising for the inhabitants of earth, both the ancient law was to advance
unto its spiritual interpretation; for so we preach it who have attained unto
spiritual illumination in Christ: and the message of the Gospel was to spread
until it embraced the whole world. And to the priests the law gave the use of
the trumpets to command the people: but Christ gave the ministers of the new
proclamations, by whom are meant the holy apostles, the command to preach Him
and His precepts. For they proclaim His mystery, using as it were two trumpets,
both preaching Him, as having been "from the beginning eyewitnesses and
ministers of the Word," and adding, in confirmation of their words, the
true testimonies of the law and the prophets.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

it is no difficult thing to see, that the message of the Gospel preaching,
being small at first, was soon to leap forth as it were unto great increase,
inasmuch as God had foretold of it by the voice of Isaiah, "that the whole
earth has been filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the deep waters that
cover the seas." For the preaching of salvation is everywhere poured forth
like a sea, and its onward course is irresistible. And this too the God of all
clearly told us by the voice of the prophet, "And judgment shall roll as
the waters, and righteousness as an impassable flood." For He gives the names
of judgment and righteousness to the gospel message, and grants us the
assurance that it shall roll over the world like waters and as a flood, whoso
rushing streams, as it violently pours along, no man can stay.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the same method of explanation will hold good of the kingdom of God being also
compared unto leaven. For the leaven is small in quantity, yet forthwith it
seizes upon the whole mass, and quickly communicates to it its own properties.
And the word of God operates in us in a similar manner: for when admitted
within us, it makes us holy and without blame, and pervading our mind and
heart, it renders us spiritual, that as Paul says, "Our whole body and
spirit and soul may be <a name="p459"><font color="#000000">|459</font></a> "kept blameless in the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ." And that the divine word is poured out even into
the depth of our understanding, the God of all clearly shows, where He says by
one of the holy prophets, "Behold the days come, says the Lord, and I will
accomplish upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah a new covenant,
not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that
I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, because they
have not continued in My covenant, and I have also rejected them, says the
Lord. But this is the covenant which I will make with them, after those days,
says the Lord, I will put My laws in their mind, and will write them on their
hearts."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

SHIP is guided to the right port by means of the helm; but the word of God
pilots the soul of man, and leads him without risk of error to every thing that
is necessary for salvation. For so spoke one of the holy prophets; "Take
with you words:" even those which are inspired by the Holy Spirit: for no
man of sense will say, that it means the words of the wise of this world. For
their words lead men unto the pit of destruction, by bringing polytheism into
the world, and by inciting unto carnal pleasure, and to the desire of the
world's vain distractions: but the words of God point out the pathway to a
better life, and beget in us an earnestness which makes us cheerfully advance
unto the duty of performing all those things, by means of which we are made
partakers of eternal life. <a name="p461"><font color="#000000">|461</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
us listen therefore to the Saviour's words, which He addressed unto those who
wanted to learn, whether they be few who are saved: and to whom the Saviour
answered, "Strive to enter in by the strait door." Now this reply may
seem perhaps, to wander from the scope of the question. For the man wanted to
learn, whether they be few who are saved: but He described unto him the way
whereby he might be saved himself, saying, "Strive to enter in by the
strait door." What reply then do we make to this objection? We answer as
follows; that it was the custom of our common Saviour Christ to meet His
questioners, not of course according to what might seem good to them, but as
having regard to what was useful and necessary for His hearers. And this He
especially did when any one wanted to learn what was superfluous and
un-edifying. For what good was there in wishing to learn, whether there be many
or few that be saved? What benefit resulted from it to the hearers? On the
contrary it was a necessary and valuable thing to know in what way a man may
attain to salvation. He is purposely silent therefore with respect to the useless
question which had been asked Him, but proceeds to speak of what was essential,
namely, of the knowledge necessary for the performance of those duties by which
men can enter in at the strait and narrow door. For this He has also taught us
in another place, saying; "Enter in at the strait door: for wide is the
door, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are they that go
in thereby. For strait is the door, and narrow is the way that leads unto life,
and few are they that find it."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now
I consider it my duty to mention why the door is narrow, through which a man
goes unto life. Whosoever then would enter must of necessity first before
everything else possess an upright and uncorrupted faith: and, secondly, a
spotless morality, in which is no possibility of blame, according to the
measure of human righteousness. For so the prophet David also somewhere says,
very excellently framing his supplications unto God, " Judge me, O Lord,
according to my righteousness; and according to my innocency requite me."
For the innocency and righteousness of the holy angels, being in proportion to
their nature and glory, is entirely distinct from that which belongs to the
inhabitants of earth: for theirs is of <a name="p462"><font color="#000000">|462</font></a> a lower kind, and
inferior in every respect, just as they are inferior to them also in nature.
Nevertheless those who wish to live holily cannot do so without labour: for
constantly, so to speak, the pathway that leads unto virtue is rugged and
steep, and for most men too difficult to walk upon. For labours spring up
before us and we have need altogether of fortitude and patience, and nobleness
of conduct: yes, moreover, and of a mind that cannot be prevailed upon
dissolutely to take part in base pleasures, or to be led by irrational impulses
into carnal lust. He who has attained unto this in mind and spiritual fortitude
will enter easily by the strait door, and run along the narrow way. For it is
written, that "by labours a man labours for himself, and violently gains
the mastery over his destruction." You hear how the prophet plainly says,
that he gains the mastery over his destruction by violence; for as the Lord
himself again said, "The kingdom of heaven is gained by violence, and the
violent seize it."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"For
wide is the door, and broad the way that brings down many to destruction."
And what are we to understand by its broadness? It means an unrestrained
tendency to carnal lust; a base and pleasure loving life; luxurious feastings,
and revellings and banquetings, and unresisted inclinations unto every thing
which is condemned by the law, and displeasing to God: a stiff-necked mind that
will not bow to the yoke of the law: a life accursed, and relaxed in all
dissoluteness, thrusting from it the divine law, and utterly unmindful of the
sacred commandments: wealth and the vices that spring from it, scorn and pride,
and the vain imagining of transitory boastings. From all such things must those
withdraw who would enter in by the strait door, and be with Christ, and keep
festival with Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that such as are not thus minded cannot walk upon this way, He showed at once
by a plain example. For those who were too late, and so to say, did not arrive
at the feast, their lot was to be at once rejected. "For when," He
says, "the master of the house enters in, and shuts the door, and they
begin to say from without, Lord, open to us; he will say, I know you not whence
you are." For in the character as it were of some householder, who has
gathered many of his neighbours to his house and table, and has afterwards entered
<a name="p463"><font color="#000000">|463</font></a> in with his guests and closed the door, He says that
those who subsequently knock, shall have for answer, "I know you not
whence you are:" and though, He says, you importune, saying, "we have
eaten before You and drunk; and You have taught in our streets; you shall hear
none the less, I know you not whence you are. Depart far from Me, all you
workers of iniquity." For the light has no communion at all with the
darkness: nor can any one he near unto the perfectly pure God who is held by
the pollutions of sin, and whose stain is not yet washed away.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
must however next inquire who we are to understand by those who say unto
Christ, 'We have eaten and drunk in Your presence, and You have taught in our
streets? Such an assertion then would suit the Israelites, to whom also Christ
said, "you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets
in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves cast out." But how then were
they eating and drinking before God? I answer, by performing the service enacted
in the law: for when offering unto God sacrifices by the shedding of blood,
they ate and made merry. And they heard also in their synagogues the writings
of Moses, interpreting God's messages: for constantly he prefaced his words
with, 'Thus says the Lord.'<sup> </sup>These then are they who say, "We
have eaten and drunk in Your presence, and You have taught in our
streets." But the worship by the shedding of blood is not sufficient for
justification, nor verily does a man wash away his stains by having become a hearer
of the divine laws, if he does nothing of what has been commanded.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
in another way, as long as they refused to accept the faith, which justifies
the wicked, nor would follow the evangelic commands, by means of which it is
possible to practice the excellent and elect life, how could they enter the
kingdom of God? The type therefore profits not: for it justifies no man, and it
is a thing impossible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins. <a name="p464"><font color="#000000">|464</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">With
the above-named, you may number certain others also as able to say to the Judge
of all, "we have eaten and drunk in Your presence, and You have taught in
our streets." And who again are these? Many have believed in Christ, and
celebrate the holy festivals in His honour; and frequenting the churches they
also hear the doctrines of the Gospel: but they lay up in their mind of the
truths of Scripture absolutely nothing. And it is with difficulty that the
practice of virtue is brought with them even to this extent, while of spiritual
fruitfulness their heart is quite bare. These too shall weep bitterly, and
gnash their teeth; for the Lord shall deny them also. For He has said, that
"not every one that says unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven, but he that does the will of My Father Who is in heaven."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
that the Jews were about to fall utterly from their rank of being in a
spiritual sense His household, and that the multitude of the Gentiles should
enter in their stead, He showed by saying, that "there shall come from the
east and from the west, from the north and from the south, many who received
the call, and shall rest with the saints; but they shall be driven away: and
whereas they once had the first rank, they shall now take the second, by reason
of others being preferred before them." Which also happened; for the
Gentiles have been honoured far above the Jewish herd. For it was guilty both
of disobedience and of the murder of the Lord: but they honoured the faith that
is in Christ; by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion,
with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p465"><font color="#000000">|465</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

you, and tell this fox, Behold I cast out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow,

Pharisaic crew was always, so to speak, wicked and designing, and eager for
fraud, gnashing their teeth at Christ, whenever He was regarded with
admiration, and with their heart consumed by the fire of envy. And yet how was
it not rather their duty as being the people's guides, and set over the
ordinary multitude, to lead them on unto the confession of Christ's glory, as
being the purpose both of the enactment of the law, and of the preaching of the
holy prophets. But this in their great wickedness they did not do: yes! rather
in every way they resisted Him, and provoked Him incessantly to anger; and
therefore Christ said unto them, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites: for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you enter not in
yourselves, and those that were entering you have hindered." For one can
see that they had fallen into such a state of malice, and into a disposition so
contrary to the love of God, that they were not willing for Him even to dwell
in Jerusalem, lest He should benefit men, partly by filling them with wonder at
His divine miracles, and partly by shedding upon them the light of the <a name="p466"><font color="#000000">|466</font></a> accurate vision of God by means of the teaching of truths
superior to those of the law.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Such
are the thoughts to which we are here led by the purport of the lessons now set
before us. "For in that same hour, it says, certain Pharisees drew near,
and said unto Him, Depart and go hence: for Herod desires to kill You."
Come, then, and let us fix the scrutinizing eye of the mind on what is hero
said by them. Let us accurately examine which of the two is the case, whether
the speakers are to be reckoned among those who love Him, or among those who
would oppose Him. But, as it appears, there is no difficulty whatsoever in
perceiving that they were His thorough opponents. For Christ, for instance,
raised the dead from the grave, employing therein a power such as belongs to
God: for He cried, "Lazarus, come forth:" and to the widow's son,
"Young man, I say unto you, arise." But they made the miracle food
for their envy, and even said, when gathered together, "What do we,
because this man does many miracles? If we thus leave Him alone, the Romans
will come, and take away our people and our land." And then, even then, it
was that Caiaphas, planning wicked murder against Him, said; "As for you,
you know nothing at all, that it is expedient for you that one man die for the
people, and not that the whole people perish."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
they resisted Him also in other ways; at one time treating Him with scorn, and
mocking His miraculous power, and venturing even to accuse His godlike
authority, saying, that whatever was done was wrought by the help of Beelzebub:
and at another even endeavouring to give Him up to Caesar's satellites. For as
though He prohibited the Israelites from paying tax unto Caesar, they drew near
to Him in treachery and guile, saying, "Is it lawful to give tribute unto
Caesar or not?" Can those then who laid for Him all kinds of snares; who,
in their audacity and hardihood, did not even abstain from murder; who, being
cunning for wickedness, attacked Him with remorseless violence, and readily
practised all such arts as those do who hate utterly; how, I say, can such be
reckoned among those who love Him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Why
then did they draw near, saying, "Depart hence: for <a name="p467"><font color="#000000">|467</font></a>
"Herod wishes to kill You:" and what object had they in so doing? The
Evangelist tells us this, by saying, "That same hour they drew near to
Him." And what is the meaning of this carefulness of language? Why was
there this exactitude? or what hour does he mean as that in which the Pharisees
said these things to Jesus? He was occupied in teaching the Jewish multitudes,
when some one asked Him whether there be many that are saved. He passed by the
question, however, as unprofitable, and turned to that which was fitting for
Him to tell, the way, namely, by which men must walk to become heirs of the
kingdom of heaven. For He said, "Strive to enter in at the strait door:
and told them that if they refuse so to do, they will see Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and themselves cast
out." And He added thereunto, that "whereas they had been the first,
they should be the last," upon the calling namely of the heathen. These
remarks goaded the mind of the Pharisees unto anger: they saw the multitudes
already repenting, and receiving with eagerness faith in Him; and that they
needed now but a little more instruction to learn His glory and the great and
adorable mystery of the incarnation. As being likely therefore to lose their
office of being chiefs of the people, and as already fallen and expelled from
their authority over them, and deprived of their profits,----for they were fond
of wealth, and covetous, and given to lucre,----they made pretence of loving
Him, and even drew near, and said, "Depart and go hence: for Herod desires
to kill You." But, O stonyhearted Pharisee, had you been wise; had you
been well acquainted with the law of the most wise Moses; had you really fixed
your mind upon the declarations of the holy profits; it could not have escaped
you that there was no possibility of your being undetected in feigning a false
show of affection, while your mind was full of gall. He was not a mere man, and
one of those like unto us, and so liable to deception; but God in our likeness:
God Who understands everything, and "knows secrets," as it is
written, and "tries the hearts and reins;" "to Whom all things
are naked, and spread open," and from Whom nothing is hid. But you knew
not this precious and mighty mystery: you thought that <a name="p468"><font color="#000000">|468</font></a>
you could deceive even Him Who says; "Who is this that hides from Me his
mind, and shuts up words in his heart, and thinks that from Me he hides
them?"</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">What
then does Christ answer to these things? He replied to them gently, and with
His meaning veiled, as was His wont: "Go and tell, He says, this
fox." Attend closely to the force of the expression: for the words used
seem forsooth to be directed, and to have regard, as it were, to the person of
Herod: but they really rather refer to the craftiness of the Pharisees. For
while He would naturally have said, "Tell that fox," He does not do
so, but using very skilfully a middle sort of expression, He, so to speak,
pointed to the Pharisee, who was close beside Him, and said, "this
fox." And He compares the man to a fox: for it is constantly a very crafty
animal, and, if I may so speak, malicious, such as were the Pharisees.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
what did He bid them say? "Behold, I cast out devils, and do cures today
and tomorrow, and the third I shall be perfected." You see that He
declares His intention of performing what He knew would grieve the troop of
Pharisees: for they drive Him from Jerusalem, lest by the display of miracles
He should win many unto faith in Him. But inasmuch as their purpose herein did
not escape Him as being God, He declares His intention of performing what they
hated, and says, that "He shall also rebuke unclean spirits, and deliver
the sick from their sufferings, and be perfected;" which means, that of
His own will He would endure the passion upon the cross, for the salvation of
the world. He knew, therefore, as it appears, both how and when He would endure
death in the flesh.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
Pharisees, however, imagined that the power of Herod would terrify Him, and
humble Him unto mean fears, although He is Lord of powers, and begets in us
spiritual bravery by His words, "Fear not them who kill the body, but
cannot kill the soul," And that He too makes no account of the violence of
men He showed, saying, "But I must walk today and tomorrow and the day
after." And in saying, "I must," He does not imply that an
inevitable necessity, so to speak, was laid upon Him, but rather that by the
power of <a name="p469"><font color="#000000">|469</font></a> His own will, freely and without danger He would
go wherever He chose, and traverse Judaea without any one opposing Him or
plotting Him ill, until of His own accord He received His consummation upon the
precious cross.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let
not therefore those murderers of the Lord pride themselves, or superciliously
vaunt themselves against Him. You did not win a victory over One Who fled from
suffering. You didst not seize One unwilling. You didst not prevail over One
Who refused to be caught in the meshes of your craftiness. Of His own will He
consented to suffer, as being well assured that by the death of His flesh He
would abolish death, and return again to life. For He arose from the dead,
having raised up with Him the whole nature of man, and having fashioned it anew
unto the life incorruptible.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
He shows that Jerusalem is guilty of the blood of many saints, declaring,
"that it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of her." And
what follows from this? That they were about to fall from being members of
God's spiritual family; that they were about to be rejected from the hope of
the saints, and entirely deprived of the inheritance of those blessings which
are in store for them who have been saved by faith. For that they were
forgetful of God's gifts, and intractable, and slothful unto everything that
might have profited them, He showed, saying; "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
kills the prophets, and stones them that are sent unto her, how often would I
have gathered your sons, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you
would not: behold your house is abandoned unto you." For He taught them by
the most wise Moses, and ordained for them the law to direct them in their
conduct, and be their ruler and guide in the life </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

possessed the type of the true worship: He admonished them by the holy

and ungrateful, and despisers.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"But,"
says He, "you shall not see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is he
that comes in the Name of the Lord." And what again is this? The Lord
withdrew from Jerusalem, <a name="p470"><font color="#000000">|470</font></a> and left as unworthy of His
presence those who said, "Depart and go hence." And afterwards having
traversed Judaea, and saved many, and performed miracles which no words can
adequately describe, He returned again to Jerusalem. And then it was, even
then, that He sat upon a foal and an ass, while vast multitudes and young children,
holding up branches of palm-trees, went before Him, praising Him, and saying,
"Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is He That comes in the Name of the
Lord." Having left them therefore as being unworthy, He says that He will
then barely be seen by them when the time of His passion has arrived. For then
again He went up to Jerusalem, and entered amid praises, and at that very time
endured His saving passion in our behalf, that by suffering He might save, and
renew unto incorruption the inhabitants of the earth. For God the Father has
saved us by Christ: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and
dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p471"><font color="#000000">|471</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

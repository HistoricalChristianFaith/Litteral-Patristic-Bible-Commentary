<i>And when He had called the twelve Apostles, He gave them power and authority
over all the devils, and to heal sicknesses. And He sent them to preach the
kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And He said unto them, Take nothing for
the way: no staff: no scrip: neither bread nor money: nor shall ye have two
coats. And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart. And
whosoever will not receive you, when ye depart from that city, shake off the
dust from your feet for their testimony.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">IT
is a true saying, that the fruit of good deeds is honourable. For those who
wish to lead lives pure and undefiled as far as is possible for men, Christ
will adorn with His gifts, and grant them an abundant recompense for all their
saintly deeds, and make them partakers of His glory. For it is impossible that
He should ever lie who says: "As I live, saith the Lord, those who honour
Me, I will honour."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
a plain and clear proof of this, I take the glorious and noble company of the
holy Apostles. Behold them highly distinguished, and crowned with more than
human glory, by this fresh gift bestowed by Christ. "For He gave them, it
says, power and authority over all the devils, and to heal sicknesses."
Observe again, I pray, that the Incarnate Word of God exceeds the measure of
humanity, and is radiant with the dignities of the Godhead. For it transcends
the limits of human nature, to give authority over unclean spirits to
whomsoever He will: as does also the enabling them to deliver from sicknesses
such as were afflicted with them. For God, indeed, bestows on whom He will
powers of this kind; and on His decree alone it depends that any are able,
according to His good pleasure, to work divine miracles, and act as ministers
of the grace that is from above: but to impart to others the gift bestowed on them,
is altogether an impossibility. For the majesty and glory of the supreme nature
is found existing essentially in nothing that has being, except in Itself, and
It only. <a name="p200"><font color="#000000">|200</font></a> Be it, therefore, angel or archangel, that any
one mentions, or thrones and dominions, or the seraphim, which again are higher
in dignity, let him wisely understand this: that they indeed possess
pre-eminent authority by the powers given them from above, such as language
cannot describe, nor nature bestow: but reason altogether forbids the
supposition of their imparting these powers to others. But Christ bestows them,
as being God therefore, and as out of His own fulness: for He is Himself the
Lord of glory and of powers.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
grace then bestowed upon the holy Apostles is worthy of all admiration; but the
bountifulness of the Giver surpasses all praise and admiration: for He gives
them, as I said, His own glory. Man receives authority over the evil spirits,
and reduces unto nothingness the pride that was so high exalted, and arrogant, even
that of the devil: his wickedness he renders ineffectual, and, by the might and
efficacy of the Holy Ghost, burning him as with fire, he makes him come forth
with groans and weeping from those whom he had possessed. And yet in old time
he had said: "I will hold the whole world in my hand as a nest, and will
take it as eggs that are left: and there is no one that shall escape from me,
or speak against me." He missed, then, the truth, and fell from his hope,
proud and audacious though he was, and vaunting himself over the infirmity of
mankind. For the Lord of powers marshalled against him the ministers of the
sacred proclamations. And this verily had been foretold by one of the holy
prophets when speaking of Satan and the holy teachers: "That suddenly they
shall arise that bite thee: and they shall awake that afflict thee, and thou
shalt be their prey." For, so to speak, they bit Satan by attacking his
glory, and making his goods a spoil, and bringing them unto Christ by means of <a name="p201"><font color="#000000">|201</font></a> faith in Him: for so they attacked Satan himself. Great
therefore was the power given unto the holy Apostles by the decree and will of
Christ, the Saviour of us all. "For He gave them power and authority over
the unclean spirits."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
will, in the next place, also inquire, if it seem good, whence a grace, thus
illustrious and famous, descended upon mankind. The Only-begotten Word
therefore of God crowned human nature with this great honour by becoming flesh,
and taking upon Him our likeness. And thus, without in one single particular
departing from the glories of His majesty;----for He wrought deeds worthy of
God, even though He became, as I said, like unto us, and was of flesh and
blood;----He broke the power of Satan by His almighty word. And by His rebuking
the evil spirits, the inhabitants of earth became able to rebuke them also.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that what I say is true, I will endeavour to make quite certain. For the
Saviour, as I said, was rebuking the unclean spirits: but the Pharisees,
opening their mouth to deride His glory, had the effrontery to say, "This
man casteth not out devils, but by Beelzebub, prince of the devils." But
the Saviour rebuked them for so speaking, as men prone to mockery, and
ill-disposed, and utterly without understanding, thus saying; "If I by Beelzebub
cast out devils, by whom do your sons east them out? Therefore shall they be
your judges." For the blessed disciples, who were sons of the Jews by
their descent according to the flesh, were the terror of Satan and his angels:
for they broke their power in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And our
Lord further said: <i>"</i>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils,
then the kingdom of God is come upon you." For He, as the Only-begotten
Son of the Father, and the Word, both was and is omnipotent, and there is nothing
that is not easy to Him: but inasmuch as He rebuked evil spirits while He was
man, human nature was triumphant in Him, and crowned with godlike glory; for it
was capable of rebuking even the evil spirits with power. By Christ's casting
out devils, therefore, the kingdom of God came unto us: for one may affirm that
it is the perfection of godlike majesty to be able to beat down Satan in spite
of his resistance. <a name="p202"><font color="#000000">|202</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
glorified therefore His disciples by giving them authority and power over the
evil spirits, and over sicknesses. Did He then thus honour them without reason,
and make them illustrious without any cogent cause? But how can this be true if
For it was necessary, most necessary, that having been publicly appointed
ministers of the sacred proclamations, they should be able to work miracles,
and by means of what they wrought convince men of their being the ministers of
God, and mediators of all beneath the heaven, inviting them all to
reconciliation and justification by faith, and pointing out the way of
salvation and of life that is thereby. For the devout and intelligent need
generally only reasoning to make them understand the truth: but those who have
wandered without restraint into rebellion, and are not prepared to receive the
sound speech of him who would win them for their true profit;----such require
miracles, and the working of signs: and scarcely even so are they brought to
thorough persuasion.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
we often find that the discourse of the holy Apostles prospered in this way.
For, for example, Peter and John delivered from his malady that lame man who
lay at the beautiful gate. And upon his entering the temple, they had his aid,
as it were, in testimony of the great deed that had been wrought, and spake
with great boldness concerning Christ, the Saviour of us all; even though they
saw that those whose lot it was to be rulers of the synagogue of the Jews, were
still travailling with bitter ill-will against Him. For they said: "Ye men
of Israel, why wonder ye at this, or why gaze ye at us, as though by our own
might or righteousness we made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His
Son Jesus, Whom ye delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he
would have let Him go. But ye denied the Holy One, and the Just, and asked for
a murderer to be granted you. And Him the Prince of Life ye killed; Whom God
raised from the dead. And of Him we are witnesses: and His Name, through faith
in His Name, hath made this man strong whom ye see and know: and faith in Him
hath given him this soundness in the presence of you all." But although
many of the Jews were embittered at a loftiness of speech such <a name="p203"><font color="#000000">|203</font></a>
as this, yet against their will they put, so to speak, a bridle upon their
wrath, being ashamed because of the greatness of the miracle.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
there is another point we must not omit. For having first invested the holy
Apostles with powers thus splendid, He then bids them depart with speed, and
commence their office of proclaiming His mystery to the inhabitants of the
whole earth. For just as able generals, having equipped their bravest soldiers
with weapons of war, send them against the phalanxes of the enemy; so too does
Christ, our common Saviour and Lord, send the holy teachers of His mysteries,
clad as it were in the grace that He bestows, and fully equipped in spiritual
armour, against Satan and his angels; that so they may be unconquerable and
hardy combatants. For they were about to do battle with those who in old time
held mastery over the inhabitants of earth; even against the wicked and
opposing powers, who had divided among them all under heaven, and had made
those their worshippers who had been created in the image of God. These, then,
the divine disciples were about to vex, by summoning to the knowledge of the
truth those that were in error, and giving light to them that were in darkness:
while those who in old time worshipped them, they rendered earnest followers of
such pursuits as become saints.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
this reason very fitly He bade them take nothing with them, wishing them both
to be free from all worldly care, and so entirely exempt from the labours that
worldly things occasion, as even to pay no regard to their necessary and
indispensable food. But manifestly One Who bids them abstain even from things
such as these, entirely cuts away the love of riches and the desire of gain.
For their glory, He said, and, so to speak, their crown, is to possess nothing.
And He withdraws them even from such things as are necessary for their use, by
the command to carry nothing whatsoever, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread,
nor money, nor two coats. Observe, therefore, as I said, that He withdraws them
from vain distractions, and anxiety about the body, and bids them have no cares
about food, repeating to them, as it were, that passage in the Psalm:
"Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He shall feed thee." For true also
is that which Christ said: <a name="p204"><font color="#000000">|204</font></a> "Ye are not able to serve
God and Mammon." And again; "For where thy treasure is, there will
thy heart be also."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">That
they may lead, therefore, a consistent and simple life, and, being free from
vain and superfluous anxiety, may devote themselves entirely to the duty of
proclaiming His mystery, and labour without ceasing in publishing to men
everywhere the tidings of salvation, He commands them to be indifferent both as
regards clothing and food. And to the same effect the Saviour elsewhere spake:
"For let your loins, He says, be girt, and your lights burning." But
by their loins being girt, He means the readiness of the mind for every good
work: and by their lights burning, that their heart be filled with divine
light. And in like manner the law also of Moses plainly commands those who ate
of the lamb: "Thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girt: and your
staves in your hands: and your sandals on your feet." Observe, therefore,
that those in whom Christ, the true Lamb, dwells, must be like men girt for a
journey: for they must "shoe their feet with the readiness of the Gospel
of peace," as blessed Paul wrote unto us; and be clad as becometh
wayfarers. For it is not fitting for those charged with the divine message, if
they would prosper in their office, to remain stationary; but, as it were, they
must constantly be moving forward, and run, not for an uncertainty, but to win
a glorious hope. For even those who once had fallen under the hand of the
enemy, if by faith they fight for Christ, the Saviour of us all, will inherit
an incorruptible crown.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
I can imagine some one saying, O Lord, Thou hast commanded thy ministers to
carry with them no supply whatsoever of necessaries for food and raiment:
whence, then, will they obtain what is essential and indispensable for their
use? This too He at once points out, saying; "Into whatsoever house ye
enter, there abide, and thence depart." The fruit, He says, which you will
obtain from those you instruct, shall be sufficient. For those who receive from
you things spiritual, and gain the divine seed for their souls, shall take care
of your bodily needs. And this no one can blame: for the wise Paul also sent
word as follows: "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
thing if we shall reap your bodily things? <a name="p205"><font color="#000000">|205</font></a> "So the
Lord also commanded, that those who preach the Gospel shall live of the
Gospel." And that this same truth is signified by the command of Moses, he
clearly shews, saying, "It is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the trampling
ox." And what the intention of the law is he again showed, saying,
"Doth God care for oxen? or sayeth He it altogether on our account,
because it is fit that he who plougheth should plough in hope: and he who
trampleth the corn as having hope to share in it?" For the teachers,
therefore, to receive from those taught these trifling and easily procurable
matters is in no respect injurious.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
He commanded them both to abide in one house, and from it to take their
departure.</span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#1" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>1</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> For it was right, both that those who had once received
them should not be defrauded of the gift: and that the holy Apostles themselves
should not place any impediment in the way of their own zeal and earnestness in
preaching God's message, by letting themselves be carried off to various houses
by those whose object was, not to learn of them some necessary lesson, but to
set before them a luxurious table, beyond what was moderate and necessary.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that it is by no means without its reward to honour the saints, we learn from
our Saviour's words. For He said unto them; "Whosoever receiveth you
receiveth Me, and whosoever receiveth Me receiveth Him That sent Me." For
He purposely makes His own, and takes unto Himself, the honours paid to the
saints, in order that on every side they may have security. For what is there
better, or what is comparable unto the honour and love due unto God? But this
is rendered by giving honour to the saints. And if he who receiveth them is
right blessed, and of glorious hope, how must not also the converse be entirely
and absolutely true! For he must be full of utter misery, who is indifferent to
the duty of honouring the saints. For this reason He said, "that when ye
go out from that house, shake off the very dust from your feet for their
testimony." <a name="p206"><font color="#000000">|206</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
next, we must see what this signifies. And it is this: That from those who
would not receive them, nor set store by the charge confided to them, nor obey
the sacred message, nor receive the faith;----from such they should refuse to
receive any thing whatsoever. For it is unlikely that those who despise the
master of the house, will shew themselves generous to the servants: and that
those who impiously disregard the heavenly summons, will ask a blessing of its
preachers, by offering them things of no value, and such as the disciples could
without trouble obtain from their own people. For it is written, "Let not
the oil of the wicked anoint my head." And besides they ought to feel that
their love was due to those only who love and praise Christ; and avoid all
others of a different character: for it is written: "Have I not hated, O
Lord, them that hate Thee: and been hot exceedingly at Thy enemies? I have
hated them with a perfect hatred: they have become my enemies." So is the
love proved of earthy soldiers: for it is not possible for them to love
foreigners, while paying a due regard to their king's interests. We learn this
too by what Christ says: "that he who is not with Me is against Me; and he
that gathereth not with Me altogether scattereth."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And the day began to decline: and the twelve drew near, and said unto Him,
Send the multitudes away, and let them go into the villages, and fields round
about, and lodge, and find victuals: for we are here in a desert place. But He
said unto them, Give ye them to eat. But they said, We have no more than five
loaves and two fishes: unless we go and buy food for all this people. But they
were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, Make them sit down
in companies of fifty each. And they did so, and made them all sit down. And
when He had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven
and blessed them, and brake, and gave to His disciples to set before the
multitudes. And they did eat, and were all filled: and that which remained over
unto them was taken up, even twelve baskets of fragments.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">THE
Jews, in my opinion, have not a single argument thai can serve before the
tribunal of God as a defence for their disobedience: for their opposition had
no appearance of reason on its side. And why so? Because the law of Moses, by
shadows and figures, led them unto the mystery of Christ. For the law, or
rather the things it contained, was symbolical, and in it the mystery of Christ
was depicted by type and shadow as in a painting. And the blessed prophets also
foretold long before that in due time there should come One to redeem all
beneath the heaven, and further proclaimed the very place of His birth in the
flesh, and the signs that He would accomplish. But they were so obdurate, and
their mind so indiscriminately set upon that alone which agreed with their
prejudices, that they would not receive the words of instruction, nor be
brought to obedience even by miracles so splendid and glorious.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Such
then was their conduct: but let us, who have acknowledged the truth of His
appearing, offer Him our praises for His godlike works; such as that which the
passage before us records. For we learn by it, that our Saviour from time to <a name="p208"><font color="#000000">|208</font></a> time went out from Jerusalem and other cities and towns,
followed by multitudes, some seeking deliverance from the tyranny of devils, or
recovery from sickness; but others desiring to receive instruction from Him,
and constantly with great earnestness, remaining with Him, that they might be
made fully acquainted with His sacred doctrines. When then the day was
declining, as the Evangelist says, and evening had all but arrived, the
disciples had care of the multitudes, and drew near, offering requests on their
behalf. For they said, "Send them away, that they may go into the
neighbouring villages and fields, and lodge and find victuals; for we are in a
desert place."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
let us carefully inquire what is the meaning of the expression "Send them
away." For we shall see by it both the admirable faith of the holy
apostles, and also the supernatural and wonderful power of Christ the Saviour
of us all, in whatsoever He willeth to perform. For, as I said, some of them
followed beseeching Him to deliver thorn from the evil spirits that oppressed
them, while others sought recovery from various maladies. Since, therefore, the
disciples knew that by the mere assent of His will he could accomplish for
those sick persons what they wanted, they say "Send them away:" not
so speaking as though they were themselves at all annoyed, and considered that
the proper time had gone by; but seized with love toward the multitudes, and
beginning to have a concern for the people, as being already intent upon their
pastoral office: so that we may even take pattern by them ourselves. For to
draw near, and make supplication on the people's behalf, is an act becoming to
the saints, and the duty of spiritual fathers, and the proof of a mind that has
regard not to selfish objects alone, but already considers as its own the
interests of others: of which surpassing love this is a clear and very evident
instance. And if we may be permitted to carry our argument above the level of
human things, we say, for the benefit of such as meet with it, that when in earnest
prayer we continue with Christ, whether asking of Him healing for the maladies
of our souls, or deliverance from other sicknesses, or desiring to obtain
anything whatsoever for our advantage; there is no doubt that when we ask in
prayer any thing that is good for us, there supplicate in our behalf both the <a name="p209"><font color="#000000">|209</font></a> intelligent powers, and those holy men who have freedom of
access unto Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
observe the incomparable gentleness of Him Whom they supplicate. For not only
does He grant all that they ask Him to bestow on those who followed Him, but
also adds thereto of His own bountiful right hand; refreshing in every way
those that love Him, and nurturing them unto spiritual courage. And this we may
see from what has now been read. For the blessed disciples besought Christ that
those who were following Him, having had their requests granted them, might be
sent away, and disperse as they best could. But He commanded them to supply
them with food. The thing, however, was impossible in the eyes of the disciples,
for they had brought nothing with them but five loaves and two fishes: and this
they drew near and confessed to Him. To magnify, therefore, the greatness of
the miracle, and make it in every way evident that He is in His own nature God,
He multiplies that little many times, and looks up to heaven to ask a blessing
from above, being intent in this also upon our good. For He is Himself That
which filleth all things, being the blessing that cometh from above from the
Father. But that we may learn that when we commence a meal, and are about to
break bread; it is our duty to offer it to God, placing it, so to speak, upon
our stretched out hands, and calling down a blessing upon it from above, He
purposely became our precedent, and type, and example in the matter.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
what was the result of the miracle? It was the satisfying a large multitude
with food: for there were as many as five thousand men besides women and
children, according to what another of the holy Evangelists has added to the
narrative. Nor did the miracle end here; but there were also gathered twelve
baskets of fragments. And what do we infer from this? A plain assurance that
hospitality receives a rich recompense from God. The disciples offered five
loaves: but <a name="p210"><font color="#000000">|210</font></a> after a multitude thus large had been
satisfied, there was gathered for each one of them a basketful of fragments.
Let nothing therefore prevent those who are willing from receiving strangers,
whatever there may be likely to blunt the will and readiness of men thereunto:
and let no one say, "I do not possess suitable means; what I can do is
altogether trifling and insufficient for many." Receive strangers, my
beloved; overcome that unreadiness which wins no reward: for the Saviour will
multiply thy little many times beyond expectation, and though thou givest but
little, thou wilt receive much. "For he that soweth blessings shall also
reap blessings," according to the blessed Paul's words.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
feeding, therefore, of the multitudes in the desert by Christ is worthy of all
admiration; but it is also profitable in another way. For we can plainly see
that these new miracles accord with those in old time, and that they are the
acts of one and the same power. "He rained manna in the desert upon the
Israelites; He gave them bread from heaven; man did eat angels' food,"
according to the words of praise in the Psalms. But lo! again in the desert He
has abundantly supplied those in need of food, bringing it down, as it were,
from heaven. For His multiplying that little many times, and feeding, so to speak,
with nothing so large a multitude, is not unlike that former miracle. And to
address myself once again to the throng of the Jews, Thou wast in need of the
natural water, when thou wast walking in that long wilderness; and God gave
thee thy desire beyond thy hopes, and from an unlooked-for quarter. For, as the
Psalmist says, "He clave the rock in the desert; He gave them drink as
from the vast abyss; and He brought forth water out of the rock, and made water
flow like rivers." Tell me then, when thou hadst drunk, didst thou praise
the Worker of the miracle? Didst thou raise thy tongue for thanksgiving? or
wast thou induced by what had happened to acknowledge the ineffable power of
God? Not so: for thou murmuredst against God, saying, "Can God prepare a table
in the wilderness? If He smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and He made the
streams overflow; can He also give bread, or prepare a <a name="p211"><font color="#000000">|211</font></a>
table for His people? Thou wast not astonished at seeing the flint rock the
source of copious rivers; fountains issuing marvellously from stones, and
streams running with rapid force, but imputedst weakness to Him Who is
Almighty. And yet how was it not rather thy duty to perceive that He is the
Lord of powers? How indeed could He be unable to prepare a table, Who made the
flint rock a fountain and a stream, flowing over for that multitude?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
since thou hast brought thyself to so great folly as to imagine that there is
anything impossible with God, and with empty babble hast said that He cannot
prepare a table for His people in the wilderness, answer the question we now
put to thee: Wilt thou embrace the faith now that thou seest a table prepared
by Christ in the wilderness, and an innumerable multitude so abundantly
supplied with food that twelve baskets of remnants were collected? or wilt thou
still refuse to believe, and ask another sign? When, therefore, wilt thou be
found believing? When wilt thou cease from finding fault with the ineffable
power of Christ? When wilt thou put a door and bolt to thy tongue? and
delivering it from the language of blasphemy, change it to a better use by
praising Him, so that thou also mayest be a partaker of the blessings He
bestows? For His mercies are revealed upon those who love Him, and He delivers
them from all sickness. He supplies them also with spiritual food, by means of
which each one attains to manliness in every thing that is praiseworthy. But
upon the unbelieving and contemptuous He bestows no such gifts, but rather
brings upon them that condemnation which they fitly deserve. For by one of His
holy prophets He as it were said unto them, "Behold, they who serve Me
shall eat, but ye shall suffer hunger. Behold, they who serve Me shall drink,
but ye shall thirst. Behold, they who submit themselves to Me shall rejoice in
happiness, while ye shall lament from sorrow of heart, and wail from contrition
of spirit." And again it is written, "The Lord killeth not the
righteous soul with hunger, but wasteth the life of the wicked."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
the flocks of the believers have, as it were, a pasture full of divers plants
and flowers, in the holy Scriptures, which are their wise guides: and filled
with spiritual joy at the glorious doctrines and instructions which they
contain, they <a name="p212"><font color="#000000">|212</font></a> frequent the sacred courts. And this it is
which long ago was proclaimed in the words of Isaiah: "And there shall be
upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, running waters upon that
day." And again; "And the mountains shall drop sweetness: and the
hills flow with milk." For it is the custom of divine Scripture to compare
to mountains and hills those set over others, and whose office it is to teach,
inasmuch as they are high exalted, in respect, I mean, of their thoughts being
occupied with elevated subjects, and withdrawn from things earthly: while the
waters and the sweetness and the milk are the instructions which flow from them
as from fountains. "There shall be then, He says, at that time from every
high mountain, and from every high hill, flowing waters, and sweetness and
milk." And these are the spiritual consolations of holy instructors,
offered to the people under their charge. Of these the Jewish congregations are
deprived, because they did not receive Christ, the Lord of the hills and
mountains, the Giver of spiritual consolation, Who offers Himself as the bread
of life to those who believe in Him: for He it is Who came down from heaven,
and gave life to the world: by Whom, and with Whom, to God the Father be praise
and dominion with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p213"><font color="#000000">|213</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

may we call out to those who would search the sacred Scriptures, "Arouse
ye, and awake." For it is a thing impossible to perceive the exact meaning
of the mystery of Christ, if we use for this end a debauched mind, and an
understanding drowned, so to speak, in sleep. Need rather is there of a wakeful
mind, and a penetrating eye; for the subject is one difficult to comprehend in
the highest degree. And this is apparent now that our discourse has come to the
explanation of the passage before us. For what says the Evangelist? "And
it came to pass that as He was alone, praying, His disciples were with Him; and
He asked them, saying; Whom do the multitudes say of Me that I am? Now the
first thing we have to examine is, what it was which led our Lord Jesus Christ
to propose to the holy apostles this question, or inquiry, For no word or deed
of His is either at an unseasonable time or without a fitting reason; but
rather, He does all things wisely and in their season. What therefore do we
say, or what suitable explanation do we find for His present acts? He had fed
in the desert a vast multitude of five thousand men: and how had He fed them? With
five loaves! breaking with them into morsels two small fish! And these so
multiplied out of nothing, that twelve baskets of fragments even were taken up.
The blessed disciples therefore were astonished as well as the multitudes, and
saw by what had been wrought, that He is <a name="p214"><font color="#000000">|214</font></a> in truth God and
the Son of God. And afterwards, when they had withdrawn from the multitude and
He was alone, He occupied Himself in prayer, in this too making Himself our
example, or rather instructing the disciples how to discharge efficiently their
office as teachers. For it is, I think, the duty of those who are set over the
people, and whose lot it is to guide Christ's flocks, constantly to occupy
themselves with their necessary business, and openly practise those things with
which God is well pleased: even that saintlike and virtuous conduct which gains
great admiration, and is certain to profit the people under their charge. For
they ought either to be actively engaged in those duties which are to the glory
of God: or such as in their retirement bring upon them a blessing, and call
down upon them power from on high: of which latter, one and the most excellent
is prayer. Knowing which the divine Paul said, "Pray without
ceasing."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
I said, then, the Lord and Saviour of all made Himself an example to the
disciples of saintlike conversation, by praying alone, with them only in His
company. But His doing so might perchance trouble the disciples, and beget in
them dangerous thoughts. For they saw Him praying in human fashion, Whom
yesterday they beheld working miracles with godlike dignity. It would not
therefore have been entirely without reason, had they said among themselves;
Oh, strange conduct! Whom must we consider Him to be? God, or man? If we say
man, and like one of us; like one, that is, of the holy prophets; we see from
the ineffable miracles which He works, that He far transcends the limits of
human nature: for in manifold ways He doeth wonders as God. If we say He is
God, surely to pray is unbefitting One Who is God by nature. For of whom can
God ask what He wishes to receive? And of what can God at all be in want? To
chase away therefore such confusing thoughts, and to calm their faith, which,
so to speak, was tempest-tossed, He makes this inquiry; not as though He were
at all ignorant of what was commonly said of Him, either by those who did not
belong to the synagogue of the Jews, or by the Israelites themselves: His
object rather was to rescue them from the general mode of thinking, and implant
in them a correct faith, "Whom, therefore, He asks, do the multitudes say
that I am? <a name="p215"><font color="#000000">|215</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Thou
seest the skilfulness of the question. He did not at once say, "Whom do ye
say that I am? but refers to the rumour of those that were without, that having
rejected it, and shewn it to be unsound, He may then bring them back to the
true opinion. Which also happened: for when the disciples had said, "Some
John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others, that some prophet of those in
old time has risen up;" He said to them, "But ye, whom do ye say that
I am?" Oh! how full of meaning is that "ye!" He separates them
from all others, that they may also avoid their opinions, and not conceive an
unworthy idea of Him, nor entertain confused and wavering thoughts, themselves
too imagining that John had risen again, or one of the prophets. Ye therefore,
He says, who have been chosen; who by My decree have been called to the
apostleship; who are the witnesses of My miracles; whom do ye say that I am?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">First
before the rest Peter again springs forth, and makes himself the mouthpiece of
the whole company, pouring forth the expression of love to God, and giving
utterance to a correct and faultless confession of faith in Him, saying,
"The Christ of God." The disciple is unerring: a thoroughly
intelligent explainer of the mystery. For he does not simply say, that He is a
Christ of God; but "the Christ" rather: for there are many who have
been called "Christ," from having in various ways been anointed of
God. For some have been anointed as kings; and some as prophets; while others,
having received salvation by That Christ Who is the Saviour of all, even we
ourselves, obtain the appellation of christ, as having been anointed by the
Holy Ghost. For it is said in the words of the Psalmist, of those in old time,
that is, before the coming of our Saviour: "Touch not My christs, and do
My prophets no harm." But the words of Habakkuk refer to us; "Thou
hast gone forth to the salvation of Thy people: to save Thy christs."
Christs therefore there are many, and they have so been called from the fact
[of having been anointed ]: but He Who is God the Father's Christ is One, and
One only: not as though we indeed are christs, and not God's christs, but
belonging to some other person: but because He and He alone has as His Father
Him that is in heaven. Since therefore most wise Peter, confessing the faith
correctly and without <a name="p216"><font color="#000000">|216</font></a> error, said, "The Christ of
God," it is plain, that distinguishing Him from those to whom the appellation
generally belongs, he referred Him to God, as being His sole (Christ). For
though He be by nature God, and shone forth ineffably from God the Father as
His only begotten Word, yet He became flesh according to the Scripture. The
blessed Peter therefore professed faith in Him, lending, as I before said, his
words to the whole company of the holy apostles, and acting as spokesman for
them all, as being more accurate than the rest.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this too we ought to observe: that in Matthew's account we find that the
blessed disciple said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God:" but the wise Luke, summing up so to speak the purport, agrees with
him in the thoughts, but using fewer words, tells us that he said, "The
Christ of God." Moreover no mention is here made of that which the Saviour
spake to him: but in Matthew again we find that He said to Him plainly:
"Blessed art thou, Simeon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it to thee, but My Father in heaven." The disciple therefore was
verily taught of God; nor did he make this profession of faith for us of his
own thoughts merely, but because the divine light shone upon his understanding,
and the Father led him to a correct knowledge of the mystery of Christ. What
therefore do those mistaken innovators </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#2" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>2</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> say to this, who unwarrantably pervert the great and
adorable mystery of the incarnation of the Only Begotten, and fall from the
right way, walking in the path of crookedness? For the wise Peter acknowledged
one Christ: while they sever that One into two, in opposition to the doctrines
of truth. 'But yes, he replies, the disciple acknowledged one Christ; and so do
we also affirm that there is one Christ, by Whom we mean the Son, even the Word
that, is from God the Father </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#3" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>3</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">.' To this then <a name="p217"><font color="#000000">|217</font></a> what do we reply? Is
it not plain then, we say, to every one, that Christ asks the holy apostles,
not, Whom do men say that the Word of God is? but, who "the Son of man
is?" and that <a name="p218"><font color="#000000">|218</font></a> it was of Him that Peter confessed,
that He is "the Christ of God?" Let them also explain this to us: How
is Peter's confession worthy of admiration, if it contain nothing profound and
hidden, and, so to speak, not apparent to the generality? For what verily did
God the Father reveal to him? That the Son of man is a man? Is this the
God-taught mystery? Is it for this that he is admired, and deemed worthy of
such surpassing honours? For thus he was addressed, "Blessed art thou,
Simeon, son of Jonah."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
reason, however, for which he was thus admired is a very just one; for it was
because he believed that He Whom he saw as one of us, that is, in our likeness,
was the Son of God the Father, the Word, namely, That sprang forth from His
substance, and became flesh, and was made man. See here, I pray, the profundity
of the thoughts, the importance of the confession, the high and weighty
mystery. For He Who was there in the likeness of mankind, and as a portion of
creation, was God, Who transcends all created things! He Who dwells in the high
and lofty place was abased from His glory to be in poverty like unto us! And He
Who, as God, is Lord of all, and King of all, was in the likeness of a slave,
and in the measure of a slave! This is the faith the Saviour crowns; to those
thus minded He extends His bountiful right hand. For when He had praised Peter,
and said that he was taught of God, as one who had obtained the revelation from
above, from God the Father, He makes him more assured and more abundantly
confirmed in the faith he had professed concerning Him, by saying: "And I
say unto thee, that thou art a stone<i>; </i>and upon this stone I will build
My church: and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatsoever
thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
observe how He makes Himself at once the Lord of heaven and of earth. For He
promises things that exceed our nature, and surpass the measure of humanity;
yea, rather, even that of the angelic rank: and are suitable for that nature
only to bestow, Whose glory and sovereignty transcend all. For, first He says
that the church belongs to Him; the sacred Scriptures nevertheless distinctly
ascribe it rather to God, <a name="p219"><font color="#000000">|219</font></a> and to Him only, saying that it
is "the church of God." </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#4" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>4</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> For they say that "Christ presented it to Himself,
having neither spot nor stain, but holy rather, and blameless." As being
God therefore He says that it is His, and promises moreover to found it,
granting it to be unshaken, as being Himself the Lord of powers.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
next He says that He gives him the keys of heaven. Who is it then that thus
pours forth language appropriate to God? Is it an angel? or some other
intelligent power, whether principality, or throne, or dominion? or those holy
seraphs? Not at all: but, as I said before, such language belongs to Almighty
God alone, Whose is the sovereignty of earth and heaven. Let not, then, these
innovators divide the one Christ, so as to say that one Son is the Word of God
the Father, and that He Who is of the seed of David is another Son. For Peter
made mention of one Christ; even the Only-begotten Who became man and was made
flesh: and for this confession was counted worthy of these extraordinary
honours.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">When,
however, the disciple had professed his faith, He charged them, it says, and
commanded them to tell it to no man: "for the Son of man," He said,
"is about to suffer many things, and be rejected, and killed, and the
third day "He shall rise again." And yet how was it not rather the
duty of disciples to proclaim Him everywhere? For this was the very business of
those appointed by Him to the apostle-ship. But as the sacred Scripture saith,
"There is a time for everything." There were things yet unfulfilled
which must also be included in their preaching of Him: such as were the cross;
the passion; the death in the flesh; the resurrection from the dead; that great
and truly glorious sign by which testimony is borne Him that the Emanuel is
truly God, and by nature the Son of God the Father. For that He utterly abolished
death, and effaced destruction, and spoiled hell, and overthrew the tyranny of
the enemy, and took away the sin of the world, and opened the gates above to
the dwellers upon earth, and united earth to heaven: these things proved Him to
be, as I said, in truth God. He commanded <a name="p220"><font color="#000000">|220</font></a> them,
therefore, to guard the mystery by a seasonable silence until the whole plan of
the dispensation should arrive at a suitable conclusion. For then, when He
arose from the dead, He gave commandment that the mystery should be revealed to
all the inhabitants of the earth, setting before every man justification by
faith, and the cleansing efficacy of holy baptism. For He said, "All power
is given unto Me in heaven and in earth: Go ye, make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them in </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#5" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>5</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, and teaching them to observe all those things which I have commanded
you. And lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." For
Christ is with us and in us by the Holy Ghost, and dwells in the souls of us
all: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion and honour
with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p221"><font color="#000000">|221</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

of courage, not only by promising them the honours of victory, but even by
telling them that the very fact of suffering brings them glory, and gains for
them all praise. For it is impossible for those who would win fame in battle
not sometimes to have to endure wounds also from their opponents. But their
suffering is not without its reward, for they are praised as those who bravely
assaulted the enemy; and the very wound bears witness to the courage and valour
of their mind. And much the same arguments we see our Lord Jesus Christ also
using in a discourse, the occasion of which was as follows; He had just shewn
the disciples that it was altogether necessary for Him to endure the wicked
enterprizes of the Jews, and be mocked by them, and spit upon in the face, and
put to death, and the third day rise again. To prevent them, therefore, from
imagining that He indeed for the life of the world would suffer the scorn of
those murderers, and the other cruelties which they inflicted upon Him; but
that they would be permitted to live quietly, and might without blame avoid the
suffering readily for their piety's sake, and the endurance even of death <a name="p222"><font color="#000000">|222</font></a> itself in the flesh, should it so befal, and by so doing
would incur no disgrace, He of necessity, so to speak, testifies that those who
would be thought worthy of the glory He bestows, must attain to it by
proportionate acts of bravery, saying, "He that will come after Me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross every day, and come after Me."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Here,
too, we must wonder at the love of Christ the Saviour of us all towards the
world; for He not only consented Himself to suffer and bear so great ignominy,
humbling Himself even to the cross and death for our sakes, but also rouses His
chosen followers to the same excellent desire: even those who were to be the instructors
of men every where, and hold the post of commanders-in-chief over the people
committed to their care. For those who were appointed to so great a ministry
must in very deed be thoroughly brave and valiant, armed with an unshaken mind
and invincible courage, so as to dread no difficulties, and even if death
befal, to deride its terrors, and set at nought every fear. He who thus acts
denies himself, since, so to speak, he resigns this temporal life, and deems
its concerns worthy of no regard, inasmuch as his choice is to suffer for the
blessedness and love that is in Christ. So does a man follow Christ. For the
company of the holy Apostles is, as it were, set before us by the Psalmist's
harp, as crying out unto Christ the Saviour of all: "For Thy sake we are
killed every day; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter." For in
this also they are like unto the Emmanuel, "Who for the joy that He had,
endured the cross, having despised the shame."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He
would have those, therefore, who were to be the teachers of all beneath the sun
superior to timidity and the base love of the world, laying it down as their
duty to suffer for love of Him. And He has Himself taught us what is the
character of those of His apostles who love Him, where he said to the blessed
Peter, "Simeon, son of Jonah, lovest thou Me? Feed My lambs; feed My
sheep." "He was the good Shepherd; He laid down His life for the
sheep." For He was not a hireling; rather, those that were saved were His
own: He saw the wolf coming; He made no attempt to flee; He despised not the
flock; but, on the contrary, yielded Himself to be torn by it, that He might
deliver and save us: "For by His bruises we have been healed,"
"and He was <a name="p223"><font color="#000000">|223</font></a> afflicted for our sins." Those,
therefore, who would follow Him, and earnestly desire to be like Him, and are
set over His intelligent flocks, must undergo similar labours. For numerous
savage beasts encircle them, violent, and implacable, and that slay cruelly,
and hurry souls to the pit of destruction. For the more learned and skilful of
the heathen possess great eloquence, and adorn their false doctrine with
beautiful language: and thus they pervert some simple-minded men, making them
often wish to share their malady, and depart from the God Who is over all, to
worship others in His stead which are no gods. These heaped upon the holy
Apostles unendurable persecutions, and exposed them again and again to dangers.
For the blessed Paul commemorates the things he had been seen to suffer at
Iconium and Lystra, and at Ephesus and Damascus, For at one time he says,
"In Damascus the chief captain of Aretas the king watched the city of the
Damascenes wishing to seize me, and from a window they let me down from the
wall in a basket, and I was delivered from his hands." And again at
another time, "Alexander the smith caused me much evil." What then is
the testimony of this mighty Evangelist, this courageous and valiant champion,
who everywhere despised the utmost dangers? "For to me," he says,
"that I live is Christ; and that I die is gain." And again, "I
am crucified with Christ; but henceforth I no more live, but Christ liveth in
me: and that which I live here in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God,
Who loved me, and yielded up Himself for my sake."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
the violence of the Jews broke forth frequently against the other apostles
also: they persecuted them; they summoned them before their synagogues; they
scourged them wickedly, commanding them to keep silence, and desist from their
sacred preachings: for they said, "Did we not strictly command you not to
speak to any man in this Name?----even the Name of Christ, the Saviour of us
all;----and behold! ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine." But
after the disciples had borne their violent accusation for the firm love they
had to Christ, they went out "rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer shame for the Name." But had they been timid, and abject, and
frightened at words, and overpowered by the terrors of death, how would they
have been proved? or how have offered as fruits to God those who were called by
their <a name="p224"><font color="#000000">|224</font></a> means? For, also, the wise Paul whom no difficulty
whatsoever could overpower, when on his way to Jerusalem the prophet Agabus
loosed his girdle, and bound his own feet, and said, "So shall the Jews at
Jerusalem bind that man to whom this girdle belongs," answered and said,
''What do ye, that ye weep and break my heart? for I am ready not only to be
bound, but also to die for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
Excellently, therefore, did He command them manfully to prevail over every
persecution, and boldly to undergo trials, as being well assured that if thus
they will be zealous in His cause, they will become His friends, and share His
glory. If, therefore, a man be ready to endure and despise the terrors of
death, has he lost himself and departed, and is there nothing more in store for
him? By no means: for in that he loses his life, he especially finds it; while
to find it is to bring upon himself destruction. What fear, therefore, can the
saints now feel, if that which seemed to be hard proves rather joyous to them
that bear it; while that which is dear to men, as being exempt from pain, leads
them especially downwards to destruction and the snare of hell, according to
the Scripture.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

pleasure of the world, to excel in the love of Christ, He shows us by saying,
"For what is a man profited who hath gained the whole world, but hath lost
himself, or fallen short?" For when a man looks chiefly to that which is
pleasant and profitable for the moment, and therefore avoids suffering, and
desires to live joyously, even though he have wealth and abundance of possessions,
yet what profit hath he therefrom when he has lost himself? "Treasures
profit not the wicked," but "the fashion of this world passeth
away:" and "like clouds those pleasures recede," and riches
flies away from those that possess it: "but righteousness delivereth from
death."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

further, to set plainly before us the reward of our <a name="p225"><font color="#000000">|225</font></a> being
willing to labour, He says: "For whosoever shall be ashamed at Me and at
My words, at Him shall the Son of man be ashamed when He shall come in His
glory, and of His Father, and of His holy angels." Much that is both
useful and necessary does He effect by these words. For in the first place He
shews that entirely and altogether it follows that those who are ashamed </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#8" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>8</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> at Him and at His words will meet with the reward they
merit. And what could so give us joy as this? For if there are some in whose

dignities and crown due to their love and affection for Him, and the honours
won by their bravery, how may we not without fear of contradiction say that
they most certainly will henceforth live in never-ending honours and praises
who have attained to such splendid blessings?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

next, He also begets in them fear as well, in that he says that He shall
descend from heaven, not in His former lowliness and humiliation, like unto us,
but in the glory of His Father; even in godlike and transcendent glory, with
the holy angels keeping guard around Him. Most miserable, therefore, and
ruinous would it be to be condemned of cowardice and indolence when the Judge
has descended from above, and the angelic ranks stand at His side. But great
and most blessed, and a foretaste of final blessedness is it to be able to
rejoice in labours already accomplished, and await the recompense of past
toils. For such as these shall be praised, Christ Himself saying unto them:
"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world." May we also be deemed worthy of these

<i>But I</i> <i>say unto you truly, there are some of those standing here who
shall not taste of death, until they have seen the kingdom of God. And there
were after these things about eight days, and He took Peter, and John, and
James, and went up to the mountain to pray. And while He was praying, the look
of His countenance was altered, and His raiment was white, shining like
lightning: and behold! two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah: who
having appeared in glory, spake of His departure, that He was about to
accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with
sleep: but having roused themselves, they both saw His glory, and the two men
that stood with Him. And it came to pass, that when they were separating from
Him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
make three tabernacles, one for Thee: and one for Moses: and one for Elijah:
not knowing what he said. While he spake these things, there came a cloud, and
overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered the cloud. And there was a
voice from the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear Him. And when there
was the voice, Jesus was found alone; and they kept silence, and told no man in
those days ought of the things they had seen.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

who are skilful in the combat rejoice when the spectators clap their hands, and
are roused to a glorious height of courage by the hope of the chaplets of
victory: and so those whoso desire it is to be counted worthy of the divine
gifts, and who thirst to be made partakers of the hope prepared for the saints,
joyfully undergo combats for piety's sake towards Christ, and lead elect lives,
not setting store by a thankless indolence, nor indulging in a mean timidity,
but rather manfully resisting every temptation, and setting at nought the
violence of persecutions, while they count it gain to suffer in His behalf. For
they remember that the blessed Paul thus writes, <a name="p227"><font color="#000000">|227</font></a>
"The sufferings of this present time are not worthy of the glory that is
about to be revealed in us."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Observe,
therefore, how perfectly beautiful is the method which our Lord Jesus Christ
uses here also for the benefit and edification of the holy Apostles. For He had
said unto them, "Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself and
take up his cross every day, and follow Me. For he that will save his life
shall lose it; and he that will lose his life for My sake shall find it."
The commandment is indeed both for the salvation and honour of the saints, and
the cause of the highest glory, and the means of perfect joy: for the choosing
to suffer for the sake of Christ is not a thankless duty, but on the contrary
makes us sharers in everlasting life, and the glory that is prepared. But as
the disciples had not yet obtained power from on high, it probably occasionally
happened, that they also fell into human weaknesses, and when thinking over
with themselves any such saying as this, may have asked "how does a man
deny himself?" or how having lost himself does he find himself again? And
what reward will compensate those who thus suffer? Or of what gifts will they
be made partakers? To rescue them therefore from such timid thoughts, and, so
to speak, to mould them unto manliness, by begetting in them a desire of the
glory about to be bestowed upon them, He says, "I say unto you, there are
some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death until they have seen
the kingdom of God." Does He mean that the measure of their lives will be
so greatly prolonged as even to reach to that time when He will descend from
heaven at the. consummation of the world, to bestow upon the saints the kingdom
prepared for them? Even this was possible for Him: for He is omnipotent: and
there is nothing impossible or difficult to His all-powerful will. But by the
kingdom of God He means the sight of the glory in which He will appear at His
manifestation to the inhabitants of earth: for He will come in the glory of God
the Father, and not in low estate like unto us. How therefore did He make those
who had received the promise spectators of a thing so wonderful? He goes up
into the mountain taking with Him three chosen disciples: and is transformed to
so surpassing and godlike a brightness, that His garments even <a name="p228"><font color="#000000">|228</font></a>
glittered with rays of fire, and seemed to flash like lightning. And besides,
Moses and Elijah stood at Jesus' side, and spake with one another of His
departure, which He was about, it says, to accomplish at Jerusalem: by which is
meant the mystery of the dispensation in the flesh; and of His precious
suffering upon the cross. For it is also true that the law of Moses, and the
word of the holy prophets, foreshewed the mystery of Christ: the one by types
and shadows, painting it, so to speak, as in a picture; while the rest in manifold
ways declared beforehand, both that in due time He would appear in our
likeness, and for the salvation and life of us all, consent to suffer death
upon the tree. The standing, therefore, of Moses and Elijah before Him, and
their talking with one another, was a sort of representation, excellently
displaying our Lord Jesus Christ, as having the law and the prophets for His
body guard, as being the Lord of the law and the prophets, and as foreshown in
them by those things which in mutual agreement they before proclaimed. For the
words of the prophets are not at variance with the teachings of the law. And
this I imagine was what Moses the most priestly and Elijah the most
distinguished of the prophets were talking of with one another.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
the blessed disciples sleep awhile, as Christ continued long in prayer:----for
He performed these human duties as belonging to the dispensation:----and
afterwards on awaking they became spectators of changes thus splendid and
glorious: and the divine Peter, thinking perchance, that the time of the
kingdom of God was even now come, proposes dwellings on the mountain, and says
that it is fitting there should be three tabernacles, one for Christ, and the
others for the other two, Moses and Elijah: "but he knew not," it
says, "what he was saying." For it was not the time of the
consummation of the world, nor for the saints to take possession of the hope
promised to them; for as Paul says, "He will change our humble body into
the likeness of His,----that is, Christ's----glorious body." As therefore
the dispensation was still at its commencement, and not yet fulfilled, how
would it have been fitting for Christ to have abandoned His love to the world,
and have departed from His purpose of suffering in its behalf? For He redeemed
all under heaven, by both undergoing death <a name="p229"><font color="#000000">|229</font></a> in the flesh,
and by abolishing it by the resurrection from the dead. Peter therefore knew
not what he said </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#9" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>9</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

besides the wonderful and ineffable sight of Christ's glory, something else was
done, useful and necessary for the confirmation of their faith in Him: and not
for the disciples only, but even for us too. For a voice was given forth from
the cloud above, as from God the Father, saying: "This is My beloved Son,
hear Him. And when there was the voice," it says, "Jesus was found
alone." What then will he who is disputatious and disobedient, and whose
heart is incurable, say to these things? Lo! Moses is there, and does the
Father command the holy apostles to hear him? Had it been His will that they
should follow the commandments of Moses, He would have said, I suppose, Obey
Moses; keep the law. But this was not what God the Father here said, but in the
presence of Moses and the prophets, He commands them rather to hear Him. And
that the truth might not be subverted by any, affirming that the Father rather
bade them hear Moses, and not Christ the Saviour of us all, the Evangelist has
clearly marked it, saying, "When there was the voice, Jesus was found
alone." When therefore God the Father, from the cloud overhead, commanded
the holy apostles, saying, "Hear Him," Moses was far away, and Elijah
too was no longer nigh; but Christ was there alone. Him therefore He commanded
them to obey.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
He also is the end of the law and the prophets: for which reason He cried aloud
to the multitudes of the Jews: "If ye had believed Moses, ye would have
believed Me also: for he wrote of Me </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#10" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>10</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">." But as they persevered even unto the end in
despising the commandment given by most wise Moses, and in rejecting the word
of the holy prophets, they have justly been alienated and expelled from those
blessings that were <a name="p230"><font color="#000000">|230</font></a> promised to their fathers. For
"obedience is better than sacrifices, and to hearken than the fat of
rams," as the Scripture saith. And thus much then of the Jews: but upon us
who have acknowledged the revelation, all these blessings have necessarily been
bestowed, by means of and as the gift of the same Christ: by Whom and with

<i>But it came to pass, the day after, as they came down from the mountain, a
great crowd met Him. And, behold, a man cried out from the crowd, saying,
Teacher, I beseech Thee to regard my Son, for he is my only one. And lo, a
spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it convulseth and teareth
him, and he foameth; and having bruised him scarcely departeth from him. And I
besought Thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not. And Jesus answered,
and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you,
and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. And when he was yet coming, the devil
threw him down, and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and
healed the child, and gave him to his father. And all wondered at the majesty
of God.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Scripture is inspired of God and profitable: but especially above all besides
this is the case with the holy Gospels. For He Who in old time spake the law to
the Israelites by the ministry of angels, has in person spoken unto us, when
having taken our likeness, He appeared upon earth, and went about among men.
For most wise Paul writes: "That while in old time God spake to the
fathers by the prophets in manifold parts, and manifold manners, He hath in
these latter days spoken unto us by the Son." And by one of His holy prophets,
He somewhere Himself saith, "I Who speak am near as the brightness upon
the mountains, as the feet of him that proclaimeth tidings of peace; as one
that proclaimeth good things." For lo! He frees us from the tyranny of the
enemy, that we may in purity follow Him; and that having brought to nought
"the world rulers of this darkness," even wicked spirits, He may
present us unharmed unto God the Father.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
that it is by Him that we have gained deliverance from the power of unclean
spirits, this lesson proves. For we heard read that a man ran towards Him from
among the multitude, and related the intolerable malady of his son. For he said
<a name="p232"><font color="#000000">|232</font></a> that he was cruelly torn by an evil spirit, and suffered
violent convulsions. But the manner of his approach was not free from fault:
for he made loud outcries against the company of the holy apostles, saying that
they could not rebuke Satan: whereas it would have been more fitting, had he
honoured Jesus when asking His aid, and imploring grace. For He grants us our
request when we honour and confide in Him, as being the Almighty, Whose power
nothing can withstand. For He verily is the Lord of powers </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#11" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>11</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">, and nothing can offer resistance to His will. Yea rather,
everything whatsoever that is capable of possessing power obtains entirely from
Him the possibility of being what it is. For just as He sheds His light upon
those who are capable of being illuminated, as being Himself the true light;
and just as in like manner He is the bestower of wisdom upon those who are
capable thereof, as being Himself Wisdom, and perfect understanding: so,
inasmuch as He is Power, He bestows power on those capable of receiving it.
When then by our disbelief we despise His glory, and wickedly scorn His supreme
majesty, we can receive nothing from Him: for "we must ask in faith,
nothing wavering," as His disciple said.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
that this saying is true, we may perceive even from what takes place among us.
For such as present petitions to those who preside over affairs upon earth, and
govern mighty thrones, preface their requests with suitable praises, and confess
their universal power and majesty; addressing the memorial they present,
"To the Lords of earth, and sea, and of <a name="p233"><font color="#000000">|233</font></a> every people
and race among mankind:" and afterwards they add an account of what they
would ask. The father therefore of the demoniac was rude and uncourteous: for
he did not simply ask the healing of the child, and in so doing crown the
healer with praises, but, on the contrary, spake contemptuously of the
disciples, and found fault with the grace given them. "For I brought him,
he says, to Thy disciples, and they could not cast it out." And yet it was
owing to thy own want of faith that the grace availed not. Dost thou not
perceive that thou wast thyself the cause that the child was not delivered from
his severe illness?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
that we must have faith when we draw near to Christ, and whosoever have
obtained from Him the grace of healing, He teaches us Himself, by everywhere
requiring faith of those who approach Him, desiring to be counted worthy of any
of His gifts. For, for instance, Lazarus died at Bethany, and Christ promised
to raise him. When then one of his sisters doubted of this, and had no
expectation that the miracle would take place, Christ said, "I am the
resurrection and the life. He that believeth in Me, even though he die, shall
live." And we find elsewhere a similar occurrence. For Jairus, a ruler of
the synagogue of the Jews, when his only daughter was now breathing her last,
being caught, so to speak, in the meshes of death, besought Jesus to deliver
the damsel from what had happened: and Christ accordingly promised so to do
upon arriving at the house of the supplicant. But as He was on His way, a man
met Him from the relatives of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, "Thy
daughter is dead: trouble not the Teacher." And what was Christ's reply?
"Fear not: only believe, and she shall live."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
was the duty therefore of the father of the lad rather to lay the blame upon
his own unbelief, than upon the holy apostles. For this reason Christ justly
called out, "O faithless and perverse generation: how long shall I be with
you, and suffer you?" He justly therefore calls both the man himself, and
those like him in mind a faithless generation. For it is a wretched malady, and
whosoever is seized by it is, as He shews, perverse, and utterly without
knowledge to walk uprightly. And therefore the sacred Scriptures say of such
persons, "that their ways are crooked, and their paths <a name="p234"><font color="#000000">|234</font></a>
perverse." From this malady the divine David fled: and in order that he
may also benefit us, he reveals the set purpose of his mind thereupon, saying,
"A crooked heart hath not cleaved unto me:" that is, one that cannot
walk in an upright course. To such the blessed Baptist, as the forerunner of
the Saviour, cried, saying, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His
paths straight."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
man therefore was thoroughly an unbeliever, and perverse, refusing the straight
paths, straying from the mark, and wandering from the right ways </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#12" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>12</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">. And Christ deigns not to be with such as are thus minded,
and have fallen into this wickedness: and if one may speak in the manner of
men, He is tired and weary of them. And this He teaches us saying, "How
long shall I be with you, and suffer you?" For he who says, that those
were powerless for the expulsion of evil spirits, who by Christ's will had
received power to cast them out, finds fault with the grace itself, rather than
with the receivers of it. it was wicked blasphemy therefore: for if grace be
powerless, the fault and blame is not theirs who have received it, but rather
belongs to the grace itself. For any who will may see that the grace which
wrought in them was Christ's. For, for instance, the lame man at the beautiful
gate of the temple was made whole; but Peter ascribed the miracle to Christ,
saying to the Jews, "For Him Whom ye crucified, even by Him this man
stands before you whole: and the grace which He bestows hath given him this
soundness." Elsewhere the same blessed Peter proclaimed to one of those
who were healed by Him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee." It is
plain therefore in every way that the man wickedly found fault with Christ's
power in saying of the holy apostles, "they could not cast it out."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
besides, Christ is angry when wrong is done unto the holy preachers who have
been entrusted with the word of His Gospel, and appointed to teach it to all
under heaven, inasmuch as witness is borne them by His grace, that they are His
<a name="p235"><font color="#000000">|235</font></a> disciples, and they shed the light of the true knowledge
of God on those who everywhere were convinced by their doctrines, and the
wonderful miracles they wrought. For the miracle constantly, so to speak, leads
on to faith. It would have been deserved therefore, had the father of the
demoniac gone away disappointed, and been refused the bounteous gift. But that
no man might imagine that Christ also was unable to work the miracle, He
rebuked the unclean spirit, and forthwith delivered the youth from his malady,
and gave him to his father. For up to this time he had not been his father's,
but the property of the spirit that possessed him: but being now delivered from
his violence, he became once again his father's property, as Christ's gift: Who
also gave the holy apostles authority to work divine miracles, and rebuke with
irresistible might impure spirits, and crush Satan.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the multitudes, the blessed Evangelist says, wondered at the majesty of God.
When Christ then works miracles, it is God Who is glorified, and God only and
solely. For He is by nature God, and His majesty is incomparable, and His
supremacy without a rival, resplendent with the sovereignty of God the Father.
He is therefore to be extolled with praises, and let us say unto him, "O
Lord God of powers, Who is like unto Thee? Powerful art Thou, O Lord, and Thy
truth is round about Thee." For all things are possible to Him, and easy
to accomplish, and nothing whatsoever is too difficult or high: by Whom and
with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for

in very deed is the mystery of godliness, according to the expression of the
wise Paul: but God the Father reveals it to such as are worthy of receiving it.
For the Saviour Himself also, when speaking to the Jews, said, "Murmur not
among yourselves: no man can come unto Me, unless the Father Who sent Me draw
him." When then the blessed Peter had been counted worthy of a grace thus
glorious and wonderful, being in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, he
made a correct and faultless confession of faith in him, saying, "Thou art
the Christ, the Son of the living God." And what was the reward of which
he was thought worthy? It was to hear Christ say, "Blessed art thou,
Simeon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but My
Father in heaven." And he further received surpassing honours: for he was
entrusted by Him with the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the confession of
his faith was made the firm foundation for the Church. "For thou," He
says, "art a stone: and upon this stone I will build My Church: and the
gates of hell shall not overpower it."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">That
those therefore who were to teach the whole world might know exactly His
mystery, He usefully and necessarily explains it clearly to them beforehand,
saying, "Lay ye these words to your hearts </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#13" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>13</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">; for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands
of men." The reason then which led Christ so to speak is, I think, a
subject both useful <a name="p237"><font color="#000000">|237</font></a> and necessary for our consideration.
He had then led up into the mountain Peter, and James, and John, and been transfigured
before them, and His countenance shone as the sun: and He shewed them the
glory, with which in due time He will arise upon the world. For He will come,
not in humiliation such as ours; nor in the meanness of man's estate, but in
the majesty and splendour of the Godhead, and in transcendent glory. And again,
when He came down from the mountain. He delivered a man from a wicked and
violent spirit. Yet was He certainly about to bear for our sakes His saving
passion; and endure the wickedness of the Jews; and, as the minister of His
mysteries says, "by the grace of God to taste death for every man."
But when this came to pass, there is nothing unlikely in supposing that the
disciples would be troubled; and in their secret thoughts perhaps even say, How
is One so glorious; Who raised the dead by His godlike power; Who rebuked the
seas and the winds; Who by a word crushed Satan; how is He now seized as a
prisoner, and caught in the snares of these murderers? Were we then mistaken in
thinking that He is God? Have we fallen from the true opinion regarding Him?
For that those who knew not the mystery, that our Lord Jesus Christ would
endure the cross and death, would find therein an occasion of stumbling, is
easy to perceive, even from what the blessed Peter said to Him. For though he
had not as yet been witness of His passion, but only had heard beforehand that
it would befal Him, he interrupted Him, saying, "That be far from Thee,
Lord: this shall not be unto Thee."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In
order, therefore, that they might know what certainly would happen, He bade
them, so to speak, store up the mystery in their mind. "For lay ye
it," He says, "to your hearts." In which words, the
"ye" distinguishes them from all others. For He wished indeed that
they should themselves know what would happen, but not that they should
communicate it to others. For it was not right for the unlearned to be taught
simply His future passion, but far better, to convince them at the same time of
His having risen divinely from the grave, and abolished death, and so avoid the
danger of their being offended. When therefore the time comes, He says, that I
must suffer, ask not, How it is that One so glorious, Who <a name="p238"><font color="#000000">|238</font></a>
performed all these signs, has fallen like one of us unawares into the hands of
His enemies: but, on the contrary, be assured, when reflecting upon the
dispensation, that I am not led by human compulsion, but go willingly
thereunto. For what is there to hinder one Who knows beforehand and clearly
proclaims what is to happen, to refuse to suffer, if He so will?<i> </i>But I
submit to suffer, in order that I may redeem all beneath the heavens. For this
He plainly teaches us elsewhere, saying, "No man taketh My life from Me,
but I lay it down of My own will. I have power to lay it down: and I have power
to take it again."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

they, it says, knew not this saying; and it was hid from them, that they might
not perceive it." Now naturally any one may justly wonder, when meditating
with himself, how it was that the disciples knew not the mystery of Christ. For
though they belonged to the companies of the Jews, yet they were neither
slothful nor contemptuous, but on the contrary most earnest and diligent. For
though reckoned as handicraftsmen, whose trade was fishing in the lake, yet, as
I said, they had been soberly educated, and were far from ignorant of the
Mosaic Scriptures: for for this very reason Christ had chosen them. How then
were they ignorant of the mystery of Christ, when it had been shadowed forth
for them in various places by the law, and beautifully foreshewn in its types
as in a painting? For, to shew my meaning by an example, they were not able to
flee away from the bondage of Egypt, nor escape from the hand that oppressed
them, until they had sacrificed a lamb according to the law of Moses; and when they
had eaten its flesh, they anointed the lintels with its blood; and so put the
destroyer to shame. But it was not the mere sacrifice of a sheep that made
them, superior to death and the destroyer. Types travail with the truth: and
this act of theirs was, as I said, a foreshowing, by means of what was done in
shadows, of the saving efficacy of the death of Christ, and of the abolition of
destruction by His blood: Who also further drives away our cruel tyrant, Satan,
and delivers from the mastery of impure spirits those whom they had enslaved,
and who, like the Israelites made to serve in bricklaying, had become the
victims of earthly cares, and <a name="p239"><font color="#000000">|239</font></a> polluted fleshly lusts, and
the unprofitable distractions of this world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
mystery of the passion may be seen also in another instance. For according to
the Mosaic law two goats were offered, differing in nothing from one another,
but alike in size and appearance. Of these, one was called "the
lord:" and the other, the <i>"</i>sent-away." </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#14" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>14</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> And when the lot had been cast for <a name="p240"><font color="#000000">|240</font></a>
that which was called "lord," it was sacrificed: while the other was
sent away from the sacrifice: and therefore had the name of the
"sent-away." And Who was signified by this? The Word, though He was
God, was in our likeness, and took the form of us sinners, as far as the nature
of the flesh was concerned. The goat, then, male or female, was sacrificed for
sins. But the death was our desert, inasmuch as by sin we had fallen under the
divine curse. But when the Saviour of all Himself, so to speak, undertook the
charge, He transferred to Himself what was our due, and laid down His life,
that we might be sent away from death and destruction.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
mystery, therefore, was revealed to the Jews, by what was shadowed in the law,
had they only been acquainted with the sacred Scriptures. But, as the blessed
Paul wrote, "Blindness in part hath happened unto Israel;" and
"even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is laid upon their heart:
nor is it unveiled, because in Christ it is done away." They then boast
indeed of the law, but its purpose is entirely hidden from them; for it leads
us to the mystery of Christ. But that they were without understanding our Saviour
shews, saying; "Search the Scriptures: for in them ye think ye have
eternal life: and they it is that testify of Me. And ye desire not to come unto
Me, that ye may have life." For the divinely-inspired Scriptures conduct
him who has understanding to an accurate knowledge of the doctrines of the <a name="p241"><font color="#000000">|241</font></a> truth: but they do not at all benefit the unwise, the
ignorant, and the careless. Not because they cannot do so, but because the
infirmity of their mind renders them incapable of receiving the light which the
Scriptures give. For just as the light of the solar radiance is useless to
those deprived of sight; not as though it cannot shine, but because their eyes
are incapable of admitting and receiving it; so the holy Scriptures, though
inspired by God, profit nothing the unlearned and foolish.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

earthly teacher Who leads you to the gainful booty, nor one like unto us Whom
ye obtain as your guide, but the Word of God, Who came down from above, even
from heaven, and is the true light of heaven and earth. For the whole rational
creation is illuminated by His means, inasmuch as He is the giver of all wisdom
and understanding. From Him we receive all knowledge of virtue, and the perfect
ability to perform good works such as become saints. For, as Scripture saith,
"we are taught of God." And the passage just laid before us bears
witness also to what I have said. "For there entered," it says,

far gone from the truth. For let him know, that though God the Word became
flesh, yet that it was not possible for Him to cease to be that which He was,
and that He continued to be God. For to be able to search the hearts and reins,
and know their secrets, is the attribute of the supreme God alone, and besides
Him of no other being whatsoever. But behold, Christ searcheth the thoughts of
the holy Apostles, and fixeth the eye of Godhead upon their hidden feelings.
Therefore He too is God, as being adorned with honours thus glorious and
divine. <a name="p243"><font color="#000000">|243</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
let us just now investigate this question, whether all the blessed disciples in
common were seized with this malady? whether this thought entered all at once?
But it is, in my opinion, altogether incredible to suppose that all of them at
the same moment became the common prey of one malady: but when, as I imagine,
it happened to one, the wise Evangelist, that he might not be found framing an
accusation against an individual among his fellow disciples, expresses himself
indefinitely, saying, "There entered a thought among them, who of them is
chief.'' By this, however, we are permitted to see how very wily Satan is in
doing evil. For most versatile and full of contrivance is this snake for
mischief, plotting in a diversity of ways against those whose love is fixed
upon an honourable life, and who earnestly seek after more excellent virtues:
and if by fleshly pleasures he can prevail over any one's mind, he savagely
makes the assault, and sharpens the goad of voluptuousness, and by the very
audacity of his attacks, humbles to base lusts even a well-confirmed mind. But
if any one be manly, and escape from these snares, he then uses other artifices,
contriving baits to tempt him unto mental maladies. For he sows some seed or
other displeasing to God: and in those in whom there is something noble, and
the praise of an excellent life, he excites the passion of vainglory, exciting
them by little and little to an abominable haughtiness. For just as those who
in warlike guise are equipped to do battle with invaders, use many contrivances
against them; either drawing bows, which discharge arrows, or hurling stones
from slings, or manfully charging them with drawn swords: so also Satan uses
every artifice in carrying on war against the saints by means of manifold sins.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The
passion, therefore, and lust of vainglory attacked some one of the holy
Apostles; for the mere disputing who of them is the chief, is the mark of an
ambitious person, eager to stand at the head of the rest. But He slept not Who
knoweth how to deliver, even Christ; He saw in the disciple's mind this
thought, springing up, in the words of Scripture, like some bitter plant: He
saw the tare, the work of the wicked sower: and before it grow up high; before
it struck its root down <a name="p244"><font color="#000000">|244</font></a> deep; before it grew strong, and
took possession of the heart; He, so to speak, tears up the evil by the very
root. He saw the barbarian's arrow that had found entrance: and before it
prevailed, and pierced through the mind, He contrives a medicine. For when
passions are but beginning in us, and, so to speak, as yet in their infancy,
and not full grown, nor firmly rooted, they are easily overcome. But when they
have increased, and grown strong, they are hard to put off, and bear themselves
with no little audacity. For this reason one of the wise said: "If the
spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place: for yielding
heals many sins."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In
what way, then, does the Physician of souls amputate the passion of vainglory?
How does He deliver the beloved disciple from being the prey of the enemy, and
from a thing hateful to God and man? "He took a child, it says, and set it
by Him;" and made the event a means of benefiting both the holy Apostles
themselves, and us their successors: for this malady as a general rule preys
upon all those who are in any respect superior to other men.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
of what did He make the child He had taken a type and representation? Of an
innocent and unambitious life. For the mind of a child is void of fraud, and
his heart sincere; his thoughts are simple; he covets not rank, and knows not
what is meant by one man being higher in station than another: he has even no
unwillingness to be regarded as the least, nor sets himself above any other
person whatsoever: and though he be of good family by birth, he does not
quarrel about dignity even with a slave: nor though he have rich parents, is he
aware of any difference between himself and poor children. On the contrary, he
likes being with them, and talks and laughs with them without distinction. In
his mind and heart there is great frankness arising from simplicity and
innocence. For even the Saviour once said to the holy Apostles, or rather to
all those who love Him: "Verily I say unto you, that unless ye be
converted, and become like these children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of
God." And at another time again, when the women were bringing to Him their
infants, and the disciples prevented them, He said, "Suffer the little
children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me; for of such as they is <a name="p245"><font color="#000000">|245</font></a> the kingdom of heaven." And again the most wise Paul
desires that those who believe in Christ should be <i>"</i>grown men in
understanding, but in malice babes." And another of the holy Apostles
said: "As babes just born, love the rational and pure milk, that ye may
grow thereby unto salvation, if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
kind."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">As
I said then, Christ brought forward the child as a pattern of simplicity and
innocence, "and set him also by Him;"" shewing by him, as in a
figure, that He accepts and loves those who are such, and deems them worthy, so
to speak, of standing at His side, as being like-minded with Him, and anxious
to tread in His steps. For He said, "Learn of Me: for I am meek, and lowly
in heart." And if He Who transcends all, and is crowned with such
surpassing glories, is lowly in heart, how must it not bring upon such as we
are, yea, even upon our very selves, the blame of utter madness, if we do not
bear ourselves humbly towards the poor, and learn what our nature is, but love
to vaunt ourselves ambitiously above our measure!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
He further says: "He that receiveth this child in My name receiveth Me:
and he that recciveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me." Since, therefore,
the reward of those that honour the saints is one and the same, whether he who
is honoured be, if it so chance, of modest rank, or of exalted station and
dignity;----for he receiveth Christ, and by Him and in Him the Father;----how
was it not utterly foolish for them to quarrel among themselves, and aim at
pre-eminence, and be unwilling to be thought inferior to others, when they were
to be accepted on equal terms!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
He makes the purport of this declaration even still more <a name="p246"><font color="#000000">|246</font></a>
plain by saying: "For he that is least among you all, the same is
chief." And how is he the chief, who is regarded as the least? Is the
comparison in point of virtue? But how can this he? The foremost place is not
assigned to him who is chief in virtue above him who is otherwise. In what way,
then, is he chief who is least? Probably, then, He calls him least whom lowly
things please, and who, from modesty, does not think highly of himself. Such a
one pleases Christ: for it is written, "that every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
And Christ Himself somewhere says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for
their's is the kingdom of heaven." The ornament, therefore, of a soul that
is sanctified is a poor and humble mind: but the wish to think highly of
oneself, and to be at strife with the brethren for the sake off honour and
dignity, and foolishly to quarrel with them, is in like manner a disgrace. Such
conduct separates friends, and makes even those perhaps great enemies whoso
dispositions are similar. It overpowers the law of nature, and subverts that
innate affection which we owe our brethren. It divides lovers, and sometimes
makes even those enemies of one another, who are united by being born from one
womb. It fights against and resists the blessings of peace. Miserable is it,
and a malady invented by the wickedness of the devil. For what is there more
delusive than vainglory? Like smoke it is dispersed; like a cloud it passeth
away, and like the vision of a dream changeth into nothingness. It scarcely
equalleth the herbage in endurance, and withereth like grass. For it is
written, that "all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass." It is a weakness, therefore, despised even among us, and
numbered among the greatest evils. For who does not reckon a vainglorious man,
inflated with empty airs, an annoyance? Who does not regard with contempt, and
give the name of "boaster," to one who refuses to be on an. equality
with others, and thrusts himself forward as if claiming to be accounted their
superior? Let, then, the malady of vaingloriousness be far from those who love
Christ: and lot us rather consider our companions as better than we are, and be
anxious to adorn ourselves with that humility of mind, which is well-pleasing
to God.

requires us to "prove every thing," and says, "Be wise
money-changers." But an exact and scrupulous knowledge of each particular
matter we can obtain from no other source than from divinely-inspired
Scripture. For David in the Psalms, addressing as it were Christ, the Saviour
of all, declares; "Thy law is a lamp to my feet, and a light unto my
paths." And Solomon also writes, that "the commandment of the law is
a lamp and a light." For just as this sensible light that is in the world,
by falling on our bodily eyes, dispels the darkness; so also the law of God,
when admitted into the mind and heart of man, illuminates it thoroughly, and
does not suffer it to fall against the stumblingblocks of ignorance, nor be
caught in the wickednesses of sin.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this I say from admiration of the skilfulness here also displayed in the
lessons from the Gospel just set before us, and the purport of which ye
doubtless wish to be taught, seeing ye have assembled here from love of the
sacred doctrines, and with eagerness have formed the present meeting. What
therefore do the wise disciples say, or what do they wish to learn from Him Who
endoweth them with all wisdom, and revealeth to them the understanding of every
good work? "Teacher, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we
forbade him." Has the sting of envy troubled the holy disciples? Do they
grudge those highly favoured? Have even they admitted within them a passion so
abominable and hateful to God? "We saw one, they say, casting out devils
in Thy name, and we forbade him." Tell me, dost thou forbid one who in
Christ's name troubles Satan, and crushes evil demons? How was it not thy duty
rather to reflect, that he was not the doer <a name="p249"><font color="#000000">|249</font></a> of these
wonders, but that the grace which was in him wrought the miracle by the power
of Christ? How therefore dost thou forbid him who in Christ wins the victory?
"Yes," he saith; for he followeth not with us." Oh blind speech!
For what if he be not numbered among the holy Apostles, who is crowned with
Christ's grace, yet is he equally with you adorned with apostolic powers. There
are many diversities of Christ's gifts, as the blessed Paul tcacheth, saying;
"that to one is given the word of wisdom, but to another the word of
knowledge: and to another faith; and to another gifts of healings."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">What
therefore is the meaning of his "not walking with us," or what is the
force of the expression? Look then; for I will tell you as well as I can. The
Saviour gave the holy Apostles authority over unclean spirits, to cast them
out, and to heal all disease and all sickness among the people. And so they
did; nor was the grace given them ineffectual. For they returned with joy,
saying; "Lord, even the devils are subject to us in Thy name." They
imagined, therefore, that leave was given not to any one else but to themselves
alone to be invested with the authority which He had granted them. For this
reason they draw near, and want to learn, whether others also might exercise
it, even though they had not been appointed to the apostleship, nor even to the
office of teacher.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
find something like this also in the ancient sacred Scriptures. For God once
said to the hierophant Moses: "Choose thee seventy men of the elders of
Israel, and I will take of the Spirit that is upon thee, and give it," He
says, "to them." And when those who were chosen had assembled at the
former tabernacle, two men only excepted, who had remained in the camp, and the
spirit of prophecy descended upon them, not only those who were assembled in
the holy tabernacle prophesied, but those also who had remained in the camp.
But "Jeshua, it says, who stood before Moses, said, Eldad and Midad, lo! they
prophesy in the camp. My lord Moses forbid them. And Moses said unto Jeshua,
Enviest thou me? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, the Lord
putting His Spirit upon them." But it was Christ Who at that time made the
hierophant Moses thus speak by the Holy Ghost: and here also in person He saith
to the holy Apostles; "Forbid not him who is crushing Satan," that
is, in His name, <a name="p250"><font color="#000000">|250</font></a> "for he is not against you,</span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#16" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>16</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> He says; for he who is not against you is on your
part." For on the part of us who love Christ, are all who wish to act to
His glory, and are crowned by His grace. And this is a law to the churches
continuing even to this day. For we honour only those who lift up holy hands,
and purely and without fault or blame, in Christ's name, rebuke unclean
spirits, and deliver multitudes from various diseases: for we know that it is
Christ Who worketh in them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We
must, however, examine such things carefully. For there are verily men, who
have not been counted worthy of Christ's grace, but make the reputation of
being saints and honourable an opportunity of gain. Of such one may say, that
they are bold and shameless hypocrites, who seize honours for themselves, even
though God has not called them thereto; they praise themselves, and imitate the
bold doings of the false prophets of old, of whom God said; "I have not
sent the prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken unto them, yet they
prophesied." And so too may He say of these, I have not sanctified them,
but they falsely assume the gift for themselves: they have not been counted
worthy of My grace, but wickedly seize those things which I bestow on such
alone as are worthy to receive them. These, making a show of fasting, walk
sadly with downcast looks, while full of fraud and baseness. And often they
pride themselves on letting their nails grow long: and are especially fond of
their complexion being sallow: and though no one compel them, they delight in
enduring such misery as men have to bear in prison, hanging collars on their
necks, and putting fetters sometimes on their hands and feet. Such persons the
Saviour has commanded us to avoid, saying; "Beware of those who come to
you in sheep's clothing: but within are ravening wolves."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this, however, some one may object, 'But who, O Lord, knows the heart of man?
Who sees what is concealed within us, but Thou alone, Who by Thyself didst form
our hearts, and tryest hearts and reins? Yes, He says: "By their fruits ye
shall know them:" not by appearances, not by outward show, but by fruits.
For what is the object of their <a name="p251"><font color="#000000">|251</font></a> hypocrisy? Plainly it
looks to the love of gain. For they gape at the hands of those who visit them:
and if they see them empty, they are greatly distressed, and stung with
annoyance. For piety is with them merchandize. If, however, thou lovest wealth,
and lusteth after base gains, and hast given a place in thy mind to that most
base passion,----the love of money,----put off the sheep's skin; why labourest
thou in vain, by making a pretence of an austere and unworldly conduct? Abandon
this excessive rigour of life, and aim instead at being one who is contented

<i>And it came to pass that when the days were fulfilled for His being taken
up, that He set His face to go to Jerusalem: and sent messengers before His
face, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready
for Him. And they did not receive Him, because His face was as though He would
go to Jerusalem. And when His disciples James and John saw it, they said, Wilt
Thou that we bid fire come down from heaven to consume them? But He turned and

who are abundantly endowed with vast wealth, and pride themselves on their
ample riches, assemble fit persons to their banquets, and set before them a
sumptuously furnished table, producing by a diversity of dishes and sauces of
various kinds a pleasure superior to the mere satisfying of hunger. But from
this no benefit arises, but rather great injury to the banqueters. For more
than a sufficiency after the calls of hunger have been satisfied is always
hurtful. But those who possess heavenly riches, and know the sacred doctrines,
and have been illuminated with divine light, nourish their souls by feasting
them on instructive discourses, in order that they may become both fruitful
towards God, and skilled in the pathway unto all virtue, and earnest in accomplishing
those things by means of which a man attains to a happy issue. To this
intellectual and holy table, therefore, the sacred Word invites us; for it
says, "Eat and drink, and be drunken, my friends." But friends of
whom? evidently of God. And it is worthy of note that we are to be drunken with
these things, and that we can never be satiated with that which is to our
edification. Let us see, therefore, what kind of profit the lesson from the
Gospel sets before us upon the present occasion.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

By
which is meant, that as the time had now come when at length having borne for
us His saving passion, He should ascend to heaven, and dwell with God the
Father, He determined to proceed to Jerusalem. For this is, I think, the
meaning of His having set His face. He sends, therefore, messengers to prepare
a lodging for Him and His companions. And when they came to a village of the
Samaritans, they were not received. At this the blessed disciples were
indignant, not so much on their own account as because they did not honour Him
Who is Saviour and Lord of all. And what followed? They murmured greatly: and
as His majesty and power was not unknown to them, they said, "Lord, wilt
thou that we bid fire come down from heaven, and consume them?" But Christ
rebuked them for so speaking. And in these last words lies the purport of the
lesson: and therefore let us accurately examine the whole passage. For it is
written, "Churn milk, and it becomes butter."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
would be untrue, then, to affirm that our Saviour did not know what was about
to happen: for as He knows all things, He knew, of course, that His messengers
would not be received by the Samaritans. Of this there can be no doubt. Why,
then, did He command them to precede Him? The reason of it was His custom
assiduously to benefit the holy Apostles in every possible way: and for this
end His practice sometimes was to put them to the proof. As for instance, He
was sailing once upon the lake of Tiberias with those named above; and while so
doing he fell asleep purposely: and a violent wind having risen upon the lake,
a rough and unusual storm began to rage, and the boat was in danger, and the
crew in alarm. For He intentionally permitted the storm and the fury of the
tempest to rage against the ship, to try the faith of the disciples, and to
make manifest the greatness of His power. And this, also, was the result. For
they, in the littleness of their faith, said, "Master, save us, we
perish." And He at once arose and shewed that He is Lord of the elements;
for He rebuked the sea and the tempest, and there was an exceeding great calm.
And so also on this occasion: He knew, indeed, that those who went forward to
announce that he would lodge with them would not be received by the Samaritans;
but He permitted <a name="p255"><font color="#000000">|255</font></a> them to go, that this again might be a
means of benefiting the holy Apostles.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">What,
then, was the purpose of this occurrence? He was going up to Jerusalem, as the
time of His passion was already drawing near. He was about to endure the
contumelies of the Jews; He was about to be set at nought by the scribes and
Pharisees; and to suffer those things which they inflicted upon Him when they
proceeded to the accomplishment of all violence and wicked audacity. In order,
therefore, that they might not be offended when they saw Him suffering, as
understanding that He would have them also to be patient, and not to murmur
greatly, even though men treat them with contumely, He, so to speak, made the
contempt they met with from the Samaritans a preparatory exercise in the
matter. They had not received the messengers. It was the duty of the disciples,
treading in the footsteps of their Lord, to bear it patiently as becometh
saints, and not to say anything of them wrathfully. But they were not yet so
disposed; but being seized with too hot indignation, they would have called
down fire upon them from heaven, as far as their will went. But Christ rebuked
them for so speaking.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">See
here, I pray, how great is the difference between us and God: for the distance
is immeasurable. For He is slow to anger, and long-suffering, and of
incomparable gentleness and love to mankind: but we children of earth are quick
unto anger, hasty unto impatience, and refuse with indignation to be judged by
others when we are found out in committing any wrong act; while we are most
ready to find fault with others. And therefore God the Lord of all affirms,
saying; "For My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor your ways as My
ways; but as the heaven is far from the earth, so are My ways from your ways,
and My thoughts from your thoughts." Such, then, is He Who is Lord of all:
but we, as I said, being readily vexed, and easily led into anger, take
sometimes severe and intolerable vengeance upon those who have occasioned us
some trifling annoyance: and though commanded to live according to the Gospel,
we fall short of the practice commanded by the law. For the law indeed said,
"Eye for eye; tooth for tooth; hand for hand:" and commanded that an
equal retribution should suffice: but we, as I <a name="p256"><font color="#000000">|256</font></a> said,
though perhaps we have suffered but a trifling wrong, would retaliate very
harshly, not remembering Christ, who said: "The disciple is not greater
than his teacher, nor the slave than his master;" Who also, "when He
was reviled, reviled not again; when suffering, threatened not; but committed
His cause to Him Who judgeth righteously." As treading this path
much-enduring Job also is justly admired: for it is written of him, "What
man is like Job, who drinketh wrongs like a draught?" For their benefit,
therefore, He rebuked the disciples, gently restraining the sharpness of their wrath,
and not permitting them to murmur violently against those who sinned, but
persuading them rather to be longsuffering, and to cherish a mind immovable by
ought of this.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It
benefited them also in another way: they were to be the instructors of the whole
world, and to travel through the cities and villages, proclaiming everywhere
the good tidings of salvation. Of necessity, therefore, while seeking to fulfil
their mission, they must fall in with wicked men, who would reject the divine
tidings, and, so to speak, not receive Jesus to lodge with them </span><a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_05_sermons_47_56.htm#20" rel="nofollow"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt;text-decoration:none"><u>20</u></span></sup></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">. Had Christ, therefore, praised them for wishing that fire
should come down upon the Samaritans, and that so painful a torment should be
inflicted upon them, they would have been similarly disposed in many other
instances, and when men disregarded the sacred message, would have pronounced
their condemnation, and called down fire upon them from above. And what would have
been the result of such conduct? The sufferers would have been innumerable, and
no longer would the disciples have been so much physicians of the sick, as
torturers rather, and intolerable to men everywhere. For their own good,
therefore, they were rebuked, when thus enraged beyond measure at the contumely
of the Samaritans: in order that they might learn that as ministers of the
divine tidings, they must rather be full of longsuffering and gentleness; not
revengeful; not given to wrath, nor savagely attacking those who offend them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Paul teaches us, saying, "For I think that God hath set forth us the

the world, and to angels, and to men. Being reviled, we bless; being defamed,
we persuade: we have become the offscouring of the world; the refuse of all men
up to this day." He wrote also to others, or rather to all who had not yet
received Christ in them, but, so to speak, were still afflicted with the pride
of the Samaritans: "We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
God."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

covet the gifts that come from above from God is in very deed a state of mind
worthy of being attained to, and that wins for us all good. But though the Lord
of all be a bountiful Giver, yet giveth He not simply to all men without
distinction, but to such rather as are worthy of His bounty. For just as those invested
with the glory of royalty bestow their honours, and the various offices of
state, not upon rough and ignorant men, who have nothing in them worthy of
admiration, but crown those rather, who have hereditary nobility, and have been
proved by trial worthy of receiving them, and likely to be successful in the
discharge of their duties; so also God, Who knoweth all things, bestoweth not a
share in His bounties upon souls careless and pleasure seeking, but upon such
as are in a fit state rightly to receive them. If then any one would be
accounted worthy of these great honours, and of being accepted by God, let him
first free himself from the pollutions of evil, and the guilt of indifference;
for so he will become capable of receiving them: but if he be not so disposed
in mind, let him depart far away.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
this the purport of the passage from the Gospels just placed before us teaches
us: for a certain man drew near to Christ the Saviour of us all saying,
"Teacher, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest." But He
rejected the man, saying, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven a
place to lodge in: but that He had not where to lay His head." And yet
perchance some one may say, that 'he who promised to follow Him had attained to
the desire of what was honourable, and good, and profitable. For what is
comparable to being with Christ, and following Him? Or how must it not aid in
his salvation? Why therefore did He reject one who was <a name="p259"><font color="#000000">|259</font></a>
eagerly promising to follow Him constantly? For one may learn from His own
words, that to follow Him leads on to every blessing: for He said, "He
that followeth Me, walketh not in darkness, but possesseth the light of
life." What therefore was there improper in promising to follow Him, in
order to gain the light of life? What then is our answer to this? That this was
not his object. How could it be? For it is easy for any who will examine such
matters accurately, to perceive that in the first place there was great
ignorance in his manner of drawing near; and secondly, that it was full of
excessive presumptuousness. For his wish was not simply to follow Christ, as so
many others of the Jewish multitude did, but rather to thrust himself into
apostolic honours. This then was the following which he was seeking for, being
self-called thereto: whereas the blessed Paul writes, "that no man taketh
the honour unto himself unless he be called of God, as Aaron also was."
For Aaron did not enter upon the priesthood of himself, but on the contrary was
called of God. And of every one of the holy apostles we find, that he did not
promote himself to the apostleship, but rather received the honour from Christ.
For He said, "Come after Me; and I will make you to become fishers of
men." But this man, as I said, boldly took upon himself gifts thus
altogether honourable, and, though no one called him, thrust himself into that
which was above his rank. Now were any one to draw near to an earthly king, and
say, "I shall promote myself, even though thou grantest it not, to this or
that honour, whatever it may be;" it would be a dangerous act, and one
that would bring upon him the loss often even of his life. Who can doubt that
certainly this would be the result? For in every matter we must await the
decision of him who possesses sovereign authority. How then could it be fitting
for this man to appoint himself among the disciples, and crown himself with
apostolic powers, without being called thereunto at all by Christ?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
there is another reason for which He justly rejected him, and deemed him unworthy
of so illustrious an honour. For earnestly to follow Christ is confessedly
profitable to salvation: but he who wishes to be counted worthy of so great
glory must, I say, bear his cross. And what is it to bear the cross? It is to
die unto the world, by denying its empty <a name="p260"><font color="#000000">|260</font></a> distractions,
and manfully abandoning a carnal and pleasure-loving life. For it is written:
"Love not the world: neither the things that are in the world: for every
thing that is in the world is the lust of the body, and the lust of the eyes,
and the pride of life."... And again, "Know ye not that the love of
the world is enmity unto God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the
world is found God's enemy." The man therefore, whose choice it is to be
with Christ, loves that which is admirable and profitable unto salvation; but
let him hearken to our words: withdraw thyself far from fleshly lusts; wash
away the pollution of wickedness; cleanse off the stains caused by the base
love of pleasure; for these keep thee away, and permit thee not to be with
Christ. Remove that which separates thee; break down the enmity; burst open the
hedge that is between; for then thou wilt be with Christ. But if the hedge
which keeps thee from communion with Him be not yet destroyed, in what manner
canst thou follow Him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">That
such then was the case with the man before us, He shews by the indirect rebuke
which He gave him, not in order to reproach him, but rather for his correction,
that he might of his own accord grow better, and become earnest in following
the ways of virtue. Therefore He says, "The foxes have holes, and the
birds of heaven a place to lodge in: but the Son of man hath not where to lay
His head." And the simple meaning of the passage, and that ready to hand,
is as follows: that the beasts and birds have dens and dwellings; but I have
nothing to offer of those things which are the objects of general pursuit: for
1 have no place where to dwell, and rest Myself, and lay My head. But the inner
and secret signification of the passage is attained to by more profound
thoughts. For He seems to mean by the foxes and birds of heaven, those wicked,
and cunning, and impure powers, the herds of demons. For they are so called in
many places in the inspired Scripture. For the blessed Psalmist says of certain
men, "They shall be the portions of foxes." And in the Song of Songs
it is written again: "Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that
destroy the vines." And Christ Himself somewhere says of Herod, who was a
bad man, and crafty in his wickedness; "Tell that fox." And elsewhere
He said of the seeds that fell upon the pathways, "the birds of heaven
came and devoured them." <a name="p261"><font color="#000000">|261</font></a> And this we affirm that He
said, not of the material and visible birds, but rather of those impure and
wicked spirits, who oft-times, when the heavenly seed has fallen upon the
hearts of men, remove and, so to speak, carry it away, that they may not bring
forth any fruit. As long therefore as the foxes and birds have holes and dens
in us, how can Christ enter? Where can He rest? What communion is there between
Christ and Belial? For He lodgeth in the saints, and dwelleth in them that love
Him: but withdraws from the impure and the unclean. Expel the beasts: hunt out
the foxes: drive away the birds: free thy heart from their impurity, in order
that the Son of man may find a place in thee to lay His head: even the Word of
God Who was incarnate and became man. For light has no concord with darkness,
nor the impure with the holy. It is a thing altogether incredible for there to
be stored up in one vessel perfume and filthiness. It is impossible for a man
to be invested with apostolic honour, and conspicuous for his virtues, and
every good and manly quality, if he have not admitted Christ into him. And so
most wise Paul has taught us saying: "Or seek ye a proof of Christ, Who
speaketh in us?" But he in whom Christ dwells is a temple, not of one of
those gods falsely so named, but of Him Who by nature, and in truth is God. For
we have been taught to say, that "we are the temples of the living
God." But to a divine temple incense is suitable, such as is of a most
sweet scent: and every virtue is a rational incense, altogether acceptable to
the God of all.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"Let
us therefore cleanse ourselves from every stain of the flesh, and of the
spirit." "Let us put to death those members which are upon the
earth." Let us close the entrance to impure spirits. Let not reprobate and
wicked birds lodge within us. Let our heart be holy and unpolluted, as far as
is possible and may be. For so shall we follow Christ, according as He giveth
us the grace, and He will dwell joyfully in us. For then He will have where to
lay His head, and rest in us as in saints. For it is written; "Become ye
holy, because I am holy." And devoting ourselves to these earnest
pursuits, we shall also attain to the city that is above, by the aid of the
same Christ: by Whom, and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion

God," as the prophet declares, and moreover the wise Paul bears witness
saying: "God, Who in manifold parts and manifold manners spake in old time
to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by the
Son." And what spake He by the Son? Plainly the gospel message of
salvation, by means of which we are successfully guided into every kind of
virtue, and advance in the praiseworthy and admirable pathway of the better
life, so that by following His footsteps we gain the treasure of His gifts. The
manner, then, in which we follow Him, and are counted worthy of those perfect

the first point to consider is this: that in the preceding passage we learnt,
that one drew near to Him, and said, "Teacher, I will follow Thee

those only who are fit to receive them, and who as being announced by every
excellent quality, and skilful in practising every good work and deed, are
crowned by Christ, and inscribed in the companies of the holy teachers. But inasmuch
as this man was not so disposed, he met with rebuke; for his mind was the
dwelling of evil spirits, and full of all impurity. For the Saviour, indirectly

be understood by us. But here it was no self-called disciple who came, nor one
presumptuously forward in promises of deeds thus praiseworthy: but, on the
contrary, it was one called by Christ to the apostleship, as not unfitted for
it. For he was honoured by the divine decree, and was doubtless holy, and
venerable; and able to conform himself to the intention of the evangelic
message. But he did not as yet know clearly in what way he ought to conduct
himself in so great a matter; for he had perchance a father bowed down with old
age: and thought himself acting in a manner highly pleasing to God in anxiously
shewing him tenderness and tit-ting love. He knew, of course, as meeting with
it in the books of the law, that the God of all has provided also for this,
saying; "Honour thy father, and thy mother: that it may be well with thee:
and that thou mayest live long upon the earth." On being, therefore,
summoned to the sacred ministry, and to the office of proclaiming the Gospel
message:----for this is what was signified by Christ's command to follow
Him:----he is troubled in his human understanding, and asks for a delay of time
enough to tend the old age of his parent. For "Suffer me," he said,
"first to go and bury my father." And what we say is, not that he
asked permission to bury his father, being already dead and laid out:----for
Christ would not have forbidden this:----but he used the word "bury"
instead of "that I may take care of his old age till his burial."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">What,
then, was the Saviour's answer? "Leave the dead burying their dead: but go
thou, preach the kingdom of God." For there were, no doubt, other
guardians and relatives of his father: but as I consider dead, because they had
not yet believed in Christ, nor been able to receive the new birth by holy
baptism unto the life incorruptible. Let them, He says, bury their dead,
because they also have within <a name="p264"><font color="#000000">|264</font></a> them a dead mind, nor as
yet have been numbered among those who possess the life that is in Christ. From
this, then, we learn, that the fear of God is to be set even above the
reverence and love due to parents. For the law of Moses also, while it
commanded, in the first place, that "thou shalt love the Lord God with all
thy soul, and all thy might, and all thy heart:" put as second to it the
honour due to parents, saying, "Honour thy father and thy mother."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">For
come, and let us examine the matter in dispute, and inquire what is the reason
why we consider the honour and love due to parents, not a thing to be
neglected, but, on the contrary, carefully to be attended to. One may say,
then, that is because we have our being by their means. But the God of all
brought us into being, when we absolutely did not exist. He is the Creator and
Maker of all: and, so to speak, the principle and radical essence of
everything. For to everything existence is His gift. The father, then, and
mother, were the means by which their offspring came into existence. Ought not,
therefore, the primary Author justly to be loved more than the secondary and
subsequent? And will not He Who gave the more precious gifts require of us the
more marked honour? Our endeavours, therefore, to please our parents must give
way to our love to God, and human duties must yield precedence to those which
are divine. And this the Saviour has Himself taught us, saying, "He who
loveth father or mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me: and he who loveth
son or daughter more than Me, is not worthy of Me." He does not say that
they are condemned for simply loving, but for loving them more than Me. He
permits sons and daughters, therefore, to love their parents, but not more than
they do Him. When therefore any thing which concerns God's glory has to be
done, let no impediment stand in the way; let thy earnestness be without
pretext: thy zealous exertions ardent and irrepressible. Forthwith let father
and mother and children be disregarded, and the power of natural affection towards
them cease, and yield the victory to the love of Christ.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">So
was that thrice-blessed Abraham tried: so was he justified, and called the
friend of God: and counted worthy of <a name="p265"><font color="#000000">|265</font></a> surpassing honours.
For what can equal in the balance the being a friend of God? What can this
world offer comparable with a grace so glorious and admirable? He had one
only-begotten and beloved son, who, after long delay, and scarcely, and in his
old age had been given him. Upon him too rested all his hope of offspring: for it
was said to him: "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." But as the
sacred Scripture saith, "God tried Abraham, saying: Take thy beloved son,
even him whom thou lovest, Isaac, and go to the high land, and offer him to Me
for a whole burnt-offering, upon one of the mountains that I will tell
thee." Was God trying Abraham, as not foreknowing what would happen, and
waiting to learn the result? But how can this be true?<i> </i>For He knows all
things before they happen. Why therefore did He try him? That we by the fact
might learn the old man's love of God, and ready obedience, and unchanging
earnestness in the dutiful performance of God's will. And observe how God made
him, so to speak, unready for the act, that the patriarch might obtain the more
worthy admiration, as preferring nothing to his Lord's will. "Take,"
He says, not simply Isaac, but <i>"</i>thy son: the beloved one;----him
whom thou hast loved." This strengthened in his case the sting of natural
affection. Oh! how mighty a turmoil of bitter thoughts rose up in the old man!
For the force of innate affection naturally called him to compassion for the
child. He had wished to be a father: for he had even lamented his childlessness
unto God, when He promised to give him all that land which had been told him,
and said, "Lord, what givest Thou me? and I dwell childless." The
law, therefore, of natural affection urged him to spare the lad; while the
power of love towards God called him to ready obedience: and he was like some
tree, driven to and fro by the violence of the winds; or like a ship at sea,
reeling, so to speak, and staggering by the beating of the waves. But there was
one true and powerful thought to which he held fast. For he considered, that
though the lad were slain, and became the work and victim of the fire, as being
a whole burnt-offering, well-pleasing to God: yet that He "was not unable
to raise him up again, oven from the dead." <a name="p266"><font color="#000000">|266</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Much,
therefore, at once was taught him by this event. For, in the first place, he
learnt that ready obedience leads on to every blessing, and is the pathway to
justification, and the pledge of friendship with God: and secondly, that God is
able to raise again, even from the dead. And, moreover, he learnt what is more
important, and more worthy of account, I mean the mystery of Christ: that for
the salvation and life of the world God the Father was about to yield His own
Son to the sacrifice: even Him, Who by nature was beloved, that is, Christ. And
the blessed Paul confirms this, saying of Him: "He That spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all." The patriarch Abraham therefore
learnt what kind of and how great a thing it is, not to spare his own son, the
only-begotten and beloved. He then was found approved, because he set nothing
above those things that are well-pleasing to God. Such Christ requires us to
be, so as to love and prize what concerns His glory far above the ties of
fleshly relationship.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And
once more to look at it in another light. It was right that the power of love
towards Him should outweigh with us even that of those who begat us in the
flesh. He has given us God as a Father; for He said: "Call not any one
father upon earth: for One is your Father Who is in heaven: and ye are all
brethren." And the wise John said of Him, "He came to His own, and
His own received Him not: but to all who received Him He gave power to become
the sons of God." Ought they therefore who have Him as Father Who is Lord
of heaven and earth: Who transcends all created things: Who is guarded by
mighty cherubim: Who excels thrones and dominions, principalities and
powers;----ought such, I say, to fall into so great folly, as not to set Him
above all natural relationship? Can it be that we shall be guilty if we
disregard the honour due to parents and children and brethren: but free from
guilt, if we pay not the honour due to the Father of all? Hear what He plainly
saith; "The son honoureth his father, and the servant his master: if I am
a Father, where is My honour? and if I am. a Master, where is My fear? saith
the Lord Almighty."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Fitly
therefore did Christ make him who was called to the <a name="p267"><font color="#000000">|267</font></a>
apostleship acquainted with apostolic conduct, and the spiritual manliness
required for its discharge, by saying, "Leave the dead burying their dead:
but go thou, preach the kingdom of God." For such must the ministers of
the divine message be. To whose wise teaching let us also in everything adhere,
advancing onwards unto Christ: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be
praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever, and ever, Amen. <a name="p268"><font color="#000000">|268</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<i>And another also said, I will follow Thee, Lord; but first let me bid
farewell to the members of my house. But Jesus said to him, No man who putteth
his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">OF
zeal in virtuous pursuits we say, that it is worthy of all praise. But those
who have attained to this state of mind <a name="p269"><font color="#000000">|269</font></a> must be strong in
purpose, and not feebly disposed towards the mark that is set before them.
Rather they must plainly possess an unwavering and inflexible mind: for so,
starting impetuously as from the barriers of the race-course, they will reach
the goal, and gain the victory, and twine around their hair the conqueror's
crown. And to this heartiness of purpose the Saviour of all encouraged us, as
being a quality worth the gaining, where He says, "Who of you wishing to
build a tower, sitteth not down first and counteth whether he have sufficient
to finish it; lest, saith He, having laid the foundation, and not being able to
finish it, the passers by say, This man began to build, and was not able to
finish." One who so acts becomes an object merely of ridicule: for upon
every honourable and virtuous undertaking a fitting conclusion ought to follow.
And to teach this truth the law of Moses commanded those who were building a
house to erect upon it also a battlement. For he who is not perfect in good, is
not free from blame. Just then as discredit was of course attached to a house
that had no battlements, so the passage just read to us from the Gospel teaches
us a similar lesson.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">"For
one drew near saying, I will follow thee, Lord; but first let me go and bid
farewell to those in my house." The promise then that he makes is worthy
of emulation, and full of all praise: but the fact of his wishing to bid
farewell to those at home shews him, so to speak, divided, and that he had not
as yet entered upon the course with unshackled mind. For look how, like some
colt eager for the race, there holds him back as with a bridle, the stream of
worldly things, and his wish in part still to take interest in this world's
occupations. For no one hinders him from hastening, if he will, to the wished
for mark, according to the free inclinations of his mind. But the very wish to
consult first with his relatives, and to make those his counsellors who were
not likely to entertain <a name="p270"><font color="#000000">|270</font></a> sentiments similar to his own,
nor to share at all in his resolution, sufficiently proves him infirm and
halting, and not as yet fully inclined to act upon his desire of following
Christ.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But
He, as it were by gentle reproofs, corrected him, and taught him to practise a
more determined zeal, saying, "No man putting his hand to the plough, and
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." For just as the husbandman,
who has begun to break up his land by the plough, if he grow weary, and leave
his labour half done, sees not his field thick set with ears, nor his
threshing-floor full of sheaves, and suffers of course the loss which is the
natural result of idleness; the absence, I mean, of produce, and the consequent
penury, and incurs also the ridicule of those that see him: so he who wishes to
cleave unto Christ, but does not bid farewell to the things of the world, and
abandon all love of the flesh, and even deny his earthly relatives; for by so
doing he attains to a resolute courage in all praiseworthy pursuits; is not fit
for the kingdom of God. One who cannot attain to this resolution, because his
mind is fettered with indolence, is not acceptable unto Christ, nor fit for His
company, and necessarily is refused permission to be with Him.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Such
were those of whom Christ spake, when forming that similitude in the Gospels.
For He said, "A rich man made a banquet for his son; and sent therefore
his servants to call them that were bidden, saying, My oxen and my failings are
killed, and every thing is ready: come to the banquet. But they, it says, would
not come: but one said, I have bought a field, and I cannot come. And another,
I have bought a yoke of oxen: and another, I have taken a wife, hold me
excused." Thou seest that they were called, and while it was in their
power to partake of the feast, they excused themselves, and gave themselves up
without restraint to those temporal and earthly matters, which rapidly fade,
and the possession of which must quickly be abandoned. And yet surely it was
their duty rather to have understood, that a wife and lands, and those other
possessions, are but finite pleasures, short in duration, and fleeting like the
shadows, and, as it were, a bitterness mingled with honey. But to be members of
the church of God, from which they, I know not how, foolishly fled, would have
procured for them an eternal and unchanging <a name="p271"><font color="#000000">|271</font></a> joy. Whoever
would follow Christ, let him be thoroughly constant, and intent solely upon
this end; let him not be divided; let him not be possessed by timidity and
slothfulness; let him be free from all carnal lust, and prefer nothing to his
love unto Him. But if he be not so disposed, nor so affected in his will, even
if he do draw near, he will not be accepted.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Something
of this sort the law of Moses also has taught us indirectly in figure. For
whenever, as emergencies arose, the children of Israel went out to battle
against their enemies, before they engaged in the combat, the herald of the
host made proclamation, "Whosoever hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
taken her, let him return to his house, that he die not in battle, and another
man take her. Whosoever hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it, let
him return to his house, that he die not in battle, and another dedicate it.
Whosoever is frightened in his heart, let him return to his house, that he make
not the heart of his brother frightened as his own." Thou seest that the
man who loves the world, or wealth, and whosoever is full of excuses, is not
every where in his place: but we shall find the holy apostles very different
from such as these. For when they heard Christ saying, "Follow Me, and I
will make you to become fishers of men: they, it says, at once </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the ship and their father, and followed Him." And the wise Paul also
writes, "But when God willed to reveal unto me His Son, immediately I
counselled not with flesh and blood." Thou seest the valiant mind, and the
brave and hearty purpose, not subject to the bonds of indolence, but superior
to all cowardice and fleshly lust. Such must they be who would follow Christ:
not looking behind them, not walking, that is, so to speak, backwards, and
turning their faces from that manly virtue which becometh saints, and excusing
themselves from the duty of labouring: not loving things temporal, not of a
double mind, but hastening onwards with perfect zeal to that which is well
pleasing to Christ: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and
dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <a name="p272"><font color="#000000">|272</font></a> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and Timothy our brother, to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colossæ;: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father.</q></p>
<p>Holy indeed are all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230301.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Epistles</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: but some advantage have those which he sent after he was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230301.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bonds</font></u></a>: those, for instance, to the Ephesians and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230301.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philemon</font></u></a>: that to Timothy, that to the Philippians, and the one before us: for this also was sent when he was a prisoner, since he writes in it thus: <q>for which I am also in bonds: that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col004.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 4:3-4</font></u></a></span> But this Epistle appears to have been written after that to the Romans. For the one to the Romans he wrote before he had seen them, but this Epistle, after; and near upon the close of his preaching. And it is evident from hence; that in the Epistle to Philemon he says, <q>Being such an one as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> the aged</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phm001.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philemon 9</font></u></a></span>, and makes request for Onesimus; but in this he sends Onesimus himself, as he says, <q>With Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col004.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 4:9</font></u></a></span>: calling him faithful, and beloved, and brother. Wherefore also he boldly says in this Epistle, <q>from the hope of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> which you heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:23</font></u></a></span> For it had now been preached for a long time. I think then that the Epistle to Timothy was written after this; and when he was now come to the very end of his life, for there he says, <q>for I am already being offered</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:6</font></u></a></span>; this is later however than that to the Philippians, for in that Epistle he was just entering upon his imprisonment at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rome</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But why do I say that these Epistles have some advantage over the rest in this respect, because he writes while in bonds? As if a champion were to write in the midst of carnage and victory; so also in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> did he. For himself too was aware that this was a great thing, for writing to Philemon he says, <q>Whom I have begotten in my bonds.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phm001.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philemon 10</font></u></a></span> And this he said, that we should not be dispirited when in adversity, but even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>. At this place was Philemon with these (Colossians).

<p>But he had not seen either these people, or the Romans, or the Hebrews, when he wrote to them. That this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> of the others, he shows in many places; with regard to the Colossians, hear him saying, <q>And as many as have not seen my face in the flesh</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col002.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 2:1-5</font></u></a></span>: and again, <q>Though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit.</q> So great a thing did he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> his presence everywhere to be. And always, even though he be absent, he makes himself present.

<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> an Apostle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>It were well also to say, what from considering this Epistle we have found to be its occasion and subject. What then is it? They used to approach God through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>; they held many Jewish and Grecian observances. These things then he is correcting. Wherefore in the very outset he says, <q>Through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> So here again he has used the expression <q>through.</q> <q>And Timothy the brother,</q> he says; of course then he too was an Apostle, and probably also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to them. <q>To the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> which are at Colossæ;.</q> This was a city of Phrygia, as is plain from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08794a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Laodicea</font></u></a>'s being near to it. <q>And faithful brethren in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col004.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 4:16</font></u></a></span> Whence, says he, are you made a saint?

For neither in deed, nor in word, nor in achievement did you show yourself faithful.

<p>I will ask those who speak disparagingly of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, Whence is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> the Father of servants? Who wrought these mighty achievements? Who made you a saint? Who faithful? Who a son of God? He who made you worthy to be trusted, the same is also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of your being entrusted with all.</p>
<p>For we are called faithful, not only because we have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, but also because we are entrusted of God with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> which not even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> before us. However, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> it was indifferent whether or not to put it thus.</p>

<p>He now gives them credit. <q>Is come,</q> he said metaphorically. He means, it did not come and go away, but that it remained, and was there. Then because to the many the strongest confirmation of doctrines is that they hold them in common with many, he therefore added, <q>As also it is in all the world.</q></p>
<p>It is present everywhere, everywhere victorious, everywhere established.</p>
<p><q>And is bearing fruit, and increasing, as it does in you also.</q></p>
<p><q>Bearing fruit.</q> In works. <q>Increasing.</q> By the accession of many, by becoming firmer; for plants then begin to thicken when they have become firm.</p>
<p><q>As also among you,</q> says he.</p>
<p>He first gains the hearer by his praises, so that even though disinclined, he may not refuse to hear him.</p>

<p>Doubt not, he says, of the hope which is to come: ye see that the world is being converted. And what need to allege the cases of others? What happened in your own is even independently a sufficient ground for belief, for, <q>ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>:</q> that is, in works. So that these two things, viz. the belief of all, and your own too, confirm the things that are to come. Nor was the fact one thing, and what Epaphras said, another. <q>Who is,</q> says he, <q>faithful,</q> that is, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>. How, <q>a minister on your behalf</q>?

And there are some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who are not of this kind, but such is not friendship, wherefore also it is easily dissolved.</p>
<p>There are many causes which produce friendship; and we will pass over those which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08001a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infamous</font></u></a>, (for none will take an objection against us in their favor, seeing they are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>.) But let us, if you will, review those which are natural, and those which arise out of the relations of life. Now of the social sort are these, for instance; one receives a kindness, or inherits a friend from forefathers, or has been a companion at table or in travel: or is neighbor to another (and these are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>); or is of the same trade, which last however is not sincere; for it is attended by a certain emulation and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. But the natural are such as that of father to son, son to father, brother to brother, grandfather to descendant, mother to children, and if you like let us add also that of wife to husband; for all matrimonial attachments are also of this life, and earthly. Now these latter appear stronger than the former: appear, I said, because often they are surpassed by them. For friends have at times shown a more genuinely kind disposition than brothers, or than sons toward fathers; and when he whom a man has begotten would not succor him, one who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> him not has stood by him, and succored him. But the spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is higher than all, as it were some queen ruling her subjects; and in her form is bright: for not as the other, has she anything of earth for her parent; neither habitual intercourse, nor benefits, nor nature, nor time; but she descends from above, out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230301.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heaven</font></u></a>. And why do you wonder that she needs no benefits in order that she should subsist, seeing that neither by injuries is she overthrown?</p>
<p>Now that this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is greater than the other, hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying; <q>For I could wish that I myself were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01455e.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anathema</font></u></a> from Christ for my brethren.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom009.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 9:3</font></u></a></span> What father would have thus wished himself in misery? And again, <q>To depart, and to be with Christ</q> is <q>very far better; yet to abide in the flesh</q> is <q>more needful for your sake.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi001.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 1:23-24</font></u></a></span> What mother would have chosen so to speak, regardless of herself? And again hear him saying, <q>For being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th002.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 2:17</font></u></a></span> And here indeed [in the world], when a father has been insulted, he withdraws his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; not so however there, but he went to those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him, seeking to do them good. For nothing, nothing is so strong as the bond of the Spirit. For he who became a friend from receiving benefits, will, should these be discontinued, become an enemy; he whom habitual intercourse made inseparable, will, when the habit is broken through, let his friendship become extinct. A wife again, should a broil have taken place, will leave her husband, and withdraw affection; the son, when he sees his father living to a great age, is dissatisfied. But in case of spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> there is nothing of this. For by none of these things can it be dissolved; seeing it is not composed out of them. Neither time, nor length of journey, nor ill usage, nor being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spoken of, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, nor insult, nor any other thing, make inroads upon it, nor have the power of dissolving it. And that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>, and yet he made entreaty for them. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo017.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 17:4</font></u></a></span> What father would have done this for one that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him, and would not rather have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him too to death?</p>
<p>Let us then follow after these friendships which are of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, for they are strong, and hard to be dissolved, and not those which arise from the table, for these we are forbidden to carry in Thither. For hear Christ saying in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, Call not your friends nor your neighbors, if you make a feast, but the lame, the maimed. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk014.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 14:12</font></u></a></span> With reason: for great is the recompense for these. But you can not, nor endurest to feast with lame and blind, but thinkest it grievous and offensive, and refusest. Now it were indeed best that you should not refuse, however it is not necessary to do it. If you seat them not with you, send to them of the dishes on your own table. And he that invites his friends, has done no great thing: for he has received his recompense here. But he that called the maimed, and poor, has God for his Debtor. Let us then not repine when we receive not a reward here, but when we do receive; for we shall have nothing more to receive There. In like manner, if man recompense, God recompenses not; if man recompense not, then God will recompense. Let us then not seek those out for our benefits, who have it in their power to requite us again, nor bestow our favors on them with such an expectation: this were a cold thought. If you invite a friend, the gratitude lasts till evening; and therefore the friendship for the nonce is spent more quickly than the expenses are paid. But if you call the poor and the maimed, never shall the gratitude perish, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, who remembers ever, and never forgets, you have even Him for your Debtor. What squeamishness is this, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, that you can not sit down in company with the poor? What do you say? He is unclean and filthy? Then wash him, and lead him up to your table. But he has filthy garments? Then change them, and give him clean apparel. Do you see not how great the gain is? Christ comes unto you through him, and do you make petty calculations of such things? When you are inviting the King to your table, do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> because of such things as these?</p>
<p>Let us suppose two tables, and let one be filled with those, and have the blind, the halt, the maimed in hand or leg, the barefoot, those clad with but one scanty garment, and that worn out: but let the other have grandees, generals, governors, great officers, arrayed in costly robes, and fine lawn, belted with golden girdles. Again, here at the table of the poor let there be neither silver, nor store of wine, but just enough to refresh and gladden, and let the drinking cups and the rest of the vessels be made from glass only; but there, at the table of the rich, let all the vessels be of silver and gold, and the semicircular table, not such as one person can lift, but as two young men can with difficulty move, and the wine-jars lie in order, glittering far beyond the silver with gold, and let the semicircle be smoothly laid all over with soft drapery. Here, again, let there be many servants, in garments not less ornamented than those of the guests, and bravely appareled, and wearing loose trowsers, men beauteous to look upon, in the very flower of life, plump, and well conditioned; but there let there be only two servants disdaining all that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proud</font></u></a> vanity. And let those have costly meats, but these only enough to appease hunger and inspire cheerfulness. Have I said enough? And are both tables laid out with sufficient minuteness? Is anything wanting? I think not. For I have gone over the guests, and the costliness both of the vessels, and of the linen, and the meats. However, if we should have omitted anything, we shall discover it as we proceed with the discourse.</p>
<p>Come then, now that we have correctly drawn each table in its proper outline, let us see at which you will seat yourselves. For I for my part am going to that of the blind, and the lame, but probably the more part of you will choose the other, that of the generals, that is so gay and splendid. Let us then see which of them does more abound in pleasure; for as yet let us not examine into the things of hereafter, seeing that in those at least this of mine has the superiority. Wherefore? Because this one has Christ sitting down at it, the other men, this has the Master, that the servants. But say we nothing of these things as yet; but let us see which has the more of present pleasure. And even in this respect, then, this pleasure is greater, for it is more pleasure to sit down with a King than with his servants. But let us withdraw this consideration also; let us examine the matter simply by itself. I, then, and those who choose the table I do, shall with much freedom and ease of mind both say and hear everything: but you trembling and fearing, and ashamed before those you sit down with, will not even have the heart to reach out your hands, just as though you had got to a school, and not a dinner, just as though you were trembling before dreadful masters. But not so they. But, says one, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> is great. Nay, I further am in more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; for your mean estate appears grander, when even while sharing the same table, the words ye utter are those of slaves.</p>
<p>For the servant then most of all shows as such, when he sits down with his master; for he is in a place where he ought not to be; nor has he from such familiarity so much dignity as he has abasement, for he is then abased exceedingly. And one may see a servant by himself make a brave appearance, and the poor man seem splendid by himself, rather than when he is walking with a rich one; for the low when near the lofty, then appears low, and the juxtaposition makes the low seem lower, not loftier. So too your sitting down with them makes you seem as of yet meaner condition. But not so, us. In these two things, then, we have the advantage, in freedom, and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; which have nothing equal to them in regard of pleasure. For I at least would prefer a crust with freedom, to thousands of dainties with slavery. For, says one, <q>Better is an entertainment of herbs with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> and kindness, than an ox from the stall with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro015.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 15:17</font></u></a></span> For whatsoever those may say, they who are present must needs praise it, or give offense; assuming thus the rank of parasites, or rather, being worse than they. For parasites indeed, even though it be with shame and insult, have yet liberty of speech: but you have not even this. But your meanness is indeed as great, (for you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and crouch,) but not so your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. Surely then that table is deprived of every pleasure, but this is replete with all delight of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But let us examine the nature even of the meats themselves. For there indeed it is necessary to burst one's self with the large quantity of wine, even against one's will, but here none who is disinclined need eat or drink. So that there indeed the pleasure arising from the quality of the food is cancelled by the dishonor which precedes, and the discomfort which follows the surfeit. For not less than hunger does surfeiting destroy and rack our bodies; but even far more grievously; and whomsoever you like to give me, I shall more easily destroy by bursting him with surfeit than by hunger. For thus the latter is easier to be borne than the other, for one might indeed endure hunger for twenty days, but surfeiting not for as many as two only. And the country people who are perpetually struggling with the one, are healthy, and need no physicians; but the other, surfeiting I mean, none can endure without perpetually calling in physicians; yea, rather, its tyranny has often baffled even their attempt to rescue.</p>
<p>So far then as pleasure is concerned, this [table of mine] has the advantage. For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> has more pleasure than dishonor, if authority than subjection, and if manly confidence than trembling and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and if enjoyment of what is enough, than to be plunged out of depth in the tide of luxury; on the score of pleasure this table is better than the other. It is besides better in regard of expense; for the other is expensive, but this, not so.</p>
<p>But what? Is it then to the guests alone that this table is the more pleasurable, or brings it more pleasure than the other to him who invites them, as well? For this is what we are enquiring after rather. Now he who invites those makes preparation many days before, and is forced to have trouble and anxious thoughts and cares, neither sleeping by night, nor resting by day; but forming with himself many plans, conversing with cooks, confectioners, deckers of tables. Then when the very day has come, one may see him in greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> than those who are going to fight a boxing match, lest anything should turn out other than was expected, lest he be shot with the glance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, lest he thereby procure himself a multitude of accusers. But the other escapes all this anxious thought and trouble by extemporizing his table, and not being careful about it for many days before. And then, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a>, after this, the former indeed has straightway lost the grateful return; but the other has God for his Debtor; and is nourished with good hopes, being every day feasted from off that table. For the meats indeed are spent, but the grateful thought is never spent, but every day he rejoices and exults more than they that are gorged with their excess of wine. For nothing does so nourish the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> hope, and the expectation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things.</p>
<p>But now let us consider what follows. There indeed are flutes, and harps, and pipes; but here is no music of sounds unsuitable; but what? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hymns</font></u></a>, singing of psalms. There indeed the Demons are hymned; but here, the Lord of all, God. Do you see with what gratitude this one abounds, with what ingratitude and insensibility that? For, tell me, when God has nourished you with His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, and when you ought to give Him thanks after being fed, do you even introduce the Demons? For these songs to the lyre, are none other than songs to Demons. When you ought to say, <q>Blessed are You, O Lord, that You have nourished me with Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things,</q> do you like a worthless dog not even so much as remember Him, but, over and above, introducest the Demons? Nay rather, dogs, whether they receive anything or not, fawn upon those they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, but thou dost not even this. The dog, although he receives nothing, fawns upon his master; but thou, even when you have received, barkest at Him. Again, the dog, even though he be well treated by a stranger, not even so will be reconciled of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> of him, nor be enticed on to be friends with him: but thou, even though suffering mischief incalculable from the Demons, introducest them at your feasts. So that, in two ways, you are worse than the dog. And the mention I have now made of dogs is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>, in regard of those who give thanks then only when they receive a benefit. Take shame, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, at the dogs, which when famishing still fawn upon their masters. But you, if you have haply heard that the Demon has cured anyone, straightway forsakest your Master; O more unreasoning than the dogs!</p>
<p>But, says one, the harlots are a pleasure to look upon. What sort of pleasure are they? Yea rather what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08001a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infamy</font></u></a> are they not? Your house has become a brothel, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>, and fury; and are you not ashamed to call this pleasure? If then it be allowed to use them, greater than all pleasure is the shame, and the discomfort which arises from the shame, to make one's house a brothel, like hogs in wallowing in the mire? But if so far only be allowed as to see them, lo! Again the pain is greater. For to see is no pleasure, where to use is not allowed, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> becomes only the greater, and the flame the fiercer.</p>
<p>But would you learn the end? Those, indeed, when they rise up from the table, are like the madmen and those that have lost their wits; foolhardy, quarrelsome, laughing-stocks for the very slaves; and the servants indeed retire sober, but these, drunk. O the shame! But with the other is nothing of this sort; but closing the table with thanksgiving, they so retire to their homes, with pleasure sleeping, with pleasure waking, free from all shame and accusation.</p>
<p>If you will consider also the guests themselves, you will see that the one are within just what the others are without; blind, maimed, lame; and as are the bodies of these, such are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of those, laboring under dropsy and inflammation. For of such sort is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>; for after the luxurious gratification a maiming takes place; of such sort is surfeiting and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, making men lame and maimed. And you will see too that these have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> like the bodies of the others, brilliant, ornamented. For they who live in giving of thanks, who seek nothing beyond a sufficiency, they whose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> is of this sort are in all brightness.</p>
<p>But let us see the end both here and there. There, indeed, is unchaste pleasure, loose laughter, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, buffoonery, filthy language; (for since they in their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are ashamed to talk filthily, this is brought about by means of the harlots;) but here is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>, gentleness. Near to him who invites those stands vainglory arming him, but near the other, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and gentleness. For the one table, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of man prepares, but the other, vainglory, and cruelty, out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a> and grasping. And that one ends in what I have said, in loss of wits, in delirium, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>; (for such are the offshoots of vainglory;) but this one in thanksgiving and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And the praise too, which comes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, attends more abundantly upon this; for that man is even regarded with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> eye, but this all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> regard as their common father, even they who have received no benefit at his hands. And as with the injured even they who have not been injured sympathize, and all become in common enemies (to the injurer): so too, when some receive kindness, they also who have not received any, not less than they who have, praise and admire him that conferred it. And there indeed is much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, but here much tender solicitude, many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> from all.</p>
<p>And so much indeed here; but There, when Christ has come, this one indeed shall stand with much boldness, and shall hear before the whole world, <q>Thou saw Me an hungered, and fed Me; naked, and clothed Me; a stranger, and took Me in</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:35</font></u></a></span>; and all the like words: but the other shall hear the contrary; <q>Wicked and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a> servant</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:26</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>Woe unto them that luxuriate upon their couches, and sleep upon beds of ivory, and drink the refined wine, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; they counted upon these things as staying, and not as fleeting.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/amo006.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amos 6:4-6</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13722a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Septuagint</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>I have not said this without purpose, but with the view of changing your minds; and that you should do nothing that is fruitless. What then, says one, of the fact that I do both the one and the other? This argument is much resorted to by all. And what need, tell me, when everything might be done usefully, to make a division, and to expend part on what is not wanted, but even without any purpose at all, and part usefully? Tell me, had you, when sowing, cast some upon a rock, and some upon very good ground; is it likely that you would have been contented so, and have said, Where is the harm, if we cast some to no purpose, and some upon very good ground? For why not all into the very good ground? Why lessen the gain? And if you have occasion to be getting money together, you will not talk in that way, but wilt get it together from every quarter; but in the other case thou dost not so. And if to lend on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15235c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">usury</font></u></a>; you will not say, <q>Wherefore shall we give some to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, and some to the rich,</q> but all is given to the former: yet in the case before us, where the gain is so great, thou dost not thus calculate, and will not at length desist from expending without purpose, and laying out without return?</p>
<p><q>But,</q> says one, <q>this also has a gain.</q> Of what kind, tell me? <q>It increases friendships.</q> Nothing is colder than men who are made friends by these things, by the table, and surfeiting. The friendships of parasites are born only from that source.</p>
<p>Insult not a thing so marvelous as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, nor say that this is its root. As if one were to say, that a tree which bore gold and precious stones had not its root of the same, but that it was gendered of rottenness; so doest even thou: for even though friendship should be born from that source, nothing could possibly be colder. But those other tables produce friendship, not with man, but with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and that an intense one, so thou be intent on preparing them. For he that expends part in this way and part in that, even should he have bestowed much, has done no great thing: but he that expends all in this way, even though he should have given little, has done the whole. For what is required is that we give, not much or little, but not less than is in our power. Think we on him with the five talents, and on him with the two. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:15</font></u></a></span> Think we on her who cast in those two mites. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar012.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 12:41</font></u></a></span> Think we on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow</font></u></a> in Elijah's days. She who threw in those two mites said not, What harm if I keep the one mite for myself, and give the other? But gave her whole living. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki017.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 17</font></u></a></span> But you, in the midst of so great plenty, art more penurious than she. Let us then not be careless of our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, but apply ourselves to almsgiving.

<p><q>Since the day we heard it,</q> says he, <q>we do not cease to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for you.</q> Not for one day do we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for you, nor yet for two, nor three. Herein he both shows his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and gives them a gentle hint that they had not yet arrived at the end. For the words, <q>that you may be filled,</q> are of this significancy. And observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a> of this blessed one. He nowhere says that they are destitute of everything, but that they are deficient; everywhere the words, <q>that you may be filled,</q> show this. And again, <q>unto all pleasing, in every good work</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:11</font></u></a></span>, and again, <q>strengthened with all power,</q> and again, <q>unto all patience and long-suffering</q>; for the constant addition of <q>all</q> bears <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> to their doing well in part, though, it might be, not in all. And, <q>that you may be filled,</q> he says; not, <q>that you may receive,</q> for they had received; but <q>that you may be filled</q> with what as yet was lacking. Thus both the rebuke was given without offense, and the praise did not suffer them to sink down, and become supine, as if it had been complete. But what is, <q>that you may be filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a></q>? That through the Son we should be brought unto Him, and no more through Angels. Now that you must be brought unto Him, you have learned, but it remains for you to learn this, and why He sent the Son. For had it been that we were to have been saved by Angels, He would not have sent Him, would not have given Him up. <q>In all spiritual wisdom,</q> he says, <q>and understanding.</q> For since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a> deceived them; I wish you, he says, to be in spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230302.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wisdom</font></u></a>, not after the wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230302.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>. But if in order to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, there needs spiritual wisdom; to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His Essence what it is, there is need of continual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> shows here, that since that time he has been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a>, and has not yet prevailed, and yet has not desisted; for the words, <q>from the day we heard it,</q> show this. But it implies condemnation to them, if, from that time, even assisted by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, they had not amended themselves. <q>And making request,</q> he says, with much earnestness, for this the expression <q>ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a></q> shows. But it is necessary still to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> somewhat besides. <q>To walk worthily,</q> he says, <q>of the Lord.</q> Here he speaks of life and its works, for so he does also everywhere: with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> he always couples conduct. <q>Unto all pleasing.</q> And how, <q>all pleasing</q>? <q>Bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> Seeing, says he, He has fully revealed Himself unto you, and seeing you have received <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> so great; do ye then show forth a conduct worthy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; for this needs elevated conduct, greater far than the old dispensation. For, he that has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and been counted worthy to be God's servant, yea, rather, even His Son, see how great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> he needs. <q>Strengthened with all power.</q> He is here speaking of trials and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecutions</font></u></a>. We <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> that you might be filled with strength, that you faint not for sorrow, nor despair. <q>According to the might of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q> But that you may take up again such forwardness as it becomes the power of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to give. <q>Unto all patience and long-suffering.</q> What he says is of this sort. Summarily, he says, we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> that you may lead a life of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and worthy of your citizenship, and may stand firmly, being strengthened as it is reasonable to be strengthened by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> he does not as yet touch upon doctrines, but dwells upon life, wherein he had nothing to charge them with, and having praised them where praise was due, he then comes down to accusation. And this he does everywhere: when he is about writing to any with somewhat to blame them for, and somewhat to praise, he first praises them, and then comes down to his charges. For he first conciliates the hearer, and frees his accusation from all suspicion, and shows that for his own part he could have been glad to praise them throughout; but by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of the case is forced into saying what he does. And so he does in the first Epistle to the Corinthians. For after having exceedingly praised them as loving him, even from the case of the fornicator, he comes down to accuse them. But in that to the Galatians not so, but the reverse. Yea, rather, if one should look close into it, even there the accusation follows upon praise. For seeing he had no good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of theirs then to speak of, and the charge was an exceeding grave one, and they were every one of them corrupted; and were able to bear it because they were strong, he begins with accusation, saying, <q>I marvel.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 1:6</font></u></a></span> So that this also is praise. But afterwards he praises them, not for what they were, but what they had been, saying, <q>If possible, you would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal005.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 5:15</font></u></a></span>.</p>
<p><q>Bearing fruit,</q> he says: this has reference to works. <q>Strengthened</q>: this to trials. <q>Unto all patience and longsuffering</q>: long-suffering towards one another, patience towards those without. For longsuffering is toward those whom we can requite, but patience toward those whom we cannot. For this reason the term patient is never applied to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but longsuffering frequently; as this same blessed one says otherwhere in his writings, <q>Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering?</q> <q>Unto all pleasing.</q> Not, one while, and afterwards not so. <q>In all spiritual wisdom,</q> he says, <q>and understanding.</q> For otherwise it is not possible to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>. Although indeed they thought they had His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>; but that wisdom was not spiritual. <q>To walk,</q> says he, <q>worthily of the Lord.</q> For this is the way of the best life. For he that has understood God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, (and he does understand it if he have seen the Son delivered up,) will have greater forwardness. And besides, we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> not for this alone that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, but that you may show forth your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> in works; for he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> without doing, is even in the way to punishment. <q>To walk,</q> he says, that is, always, not once, but continually. As to walk is necessary for us, so also is to live rightly. And when on this subject he constantly uses the term <q>walk,</q> and with reason, showing that such is the life set before us. But not of this sort is that of the world. And great too is the praise. <q>To walk,</q> he says, <q>worthily of the Lord,</q> and <q>in every good work,</q> so as to be always advancing, and nowhere standing still, and, with a metaphor, <q>bearing fruit and increasing in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> that you might be in such measure <q>strengthened,</q> according to the might of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as is possible for man to be. <q>Through His power,</q> great is the consolation.— He said not strength, but <q>power,</q> which is greater: <q>through the power,</q> he says, <q>of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q> because that everywhere His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> has the power. He thus comforts him that is under reproach: and again, <q>To walk worthily of the Lord.</q> He says of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, that He has the power everywhere both in heaven and in earth, because His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> reigns everywhere. He says not <q>strengthened</q> simply, but so, as they might be expected to be who are in the service of so strong a Master. <q>In the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> And at the same time he touches in passing upon the methods of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>; for this is to be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> God as one ought; or he means, so as to increase in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For if he that has not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not the Father either; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> is there need of increased <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>: for there is no use in life without this. <q>Unto all patience and longsuffering,</q> he says, <q>with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, giving thanks</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:12</font></u></a></span> unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Then being about to exhort them, he makes no mention of what by and by shall be laid up for them; he did hint at this however in the beginning of the Epistle, saying, <q>Because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:5</font></u></a></span>: but in this place he mentions the things which were already theirs, for these are the causes of the other. And he does the same in many places. For that which has already come to pass gains belief, and more carries the hearer along with it. <q>With <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>giving thanks</q> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. The connection is this. We cease not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a> for you, and giving thanks for the benefits already received.</p>
<p>Do you see how he bears himself along into speaking of the Son? For if <q>we give thanks with much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>,</q> it is a great thing that is spoken of. For it is possible to give thanks only from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, it is possible to give thanks even when in sorrow. For instance; Job gave thanks indeed, but in anguish; and he said, <q>The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job001.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 1:21</font></u></a></span> For, let not any say that what had come to pass pained him not, nor clothed him with dejection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; nor let his great praise be taken away from that righteous one. But when it is thus, it is not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, nor because of His being Lord alone, but for the very nature of the things themselves, that we give thanks. <q>To Him who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> in light.</q> He has said a great thing. What has been given, he says, is of this nature; He has not only given, but also made us strong to receive. Now by saying, <q>Who made us meet,</q> he showed that the thing was one of great weight. For example, were some low person to have become a king, he has it in his power to give a governorship to whom he will; and this is the extent of his power, to give the dignity: he cannot also make the person fit for the office, and oftentimes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> makes one so preferred even ridiculous. If however he have both conferred on one the dignity, and also made him fit for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and equal to the administration, then indeed the thing is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. This then is what he also says here; that He has not only given us the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, but has also made us strong enough to receive it.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> here is twofold, the giving, and the making fit for the gift. He said not, gave, simply; but, <q>made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> in light,</q> that is, who has appointed us a place with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>. But he did not say simply placed us, but has given us to enjoy even the very same things, for <q>the portion</q> is that which each one receives. For it is possible to be in the same city, and yet not enjoy the same things; but to have the same <q>portion,</q> and yet not enjoy the same, is impossible. It is possible to be in the same inheritance, and yet not to have the same portion; for instance, all we (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04049b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">clergy</font></u></a>) are in the inheritance, but we have not all the same portion. But here he does not say this, but with the inheritance adds the portion also. But why does he call it inheritance (or lot)? To show that by his own achievements no one obtains the kingdom, but as a lot is rather the result of good luck, so in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is it here also. For a life so good as to be counted worthy of the kingdom does no one show forth, but the whole is of His free gift. Therefore He says, <q>When you have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants, for we have done that which was our duty to do.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk017.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 17:10</font></u></a></span> <q>To be partakers of the inheritance of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> in light,</q>— he means, both the future and the present light, — that is, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>. He seems to me to be speaking at once of both the present and the future. Then he shows of what things we have been counted worthy. For this is not the only marvel, that we are counted worthy of the kingdom; but it should also be added who we are that are so counted; for it is not unimportant. And he does this in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, <q>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, but perhaps for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man some one would even dare to die.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:7</font></u></a></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Ver. 13</strong></font></u></a><strong><font size="4">.</font></strong> <q>Who delivered us,</q> he says, <q>from the power of darkness.</q></p>
<p>The whole is of Him, the giving both of these things and those; for nowhere is any achievement of ours. <q>From the power of darkness,</q> he says, that is, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, the dominion of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. He said not <q>darkness,</q> but <q>power</q>; for it had great power over us, and held us fast. For it is grievous indeed even to be under the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> at all, but to be so <q>with power,</q> this is far more grievous. <q>And translated us,</q> he says, <q>into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</q> Not then so as to deliver man from darkness only, did He show His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward him. A great thing indeed is it to have delivered from darkness even; but to have brought into a kingdom too, is a far greater. See then how manifold the gift, that he has delivered us who lay in the pit; in the second place, that He has not only delivered us, but also has translated us into a kingdom. <q>Who delivered us.</q> He said not, has sent us forth, but <q>delivered</q>: showing our great misery, and their capture of us. Then to show also the ease with which the power of God works, he says, <q>And translated us,</q> just as if one were to lead over a soldier from one position to another. And he said not, <q>has led over</q>; nor yet <q>has transposed,</q> for so the whole would be of him who transposed, nothing of him who went over; but he said, <q>translated</q>; so that it is both of us and of Him. <q>Into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</q> He said not simply, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>,</q> but gave a grandeur to his discourse by saying, <q>The kingdom of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>,</q> for no praise can be greater than this, as he says elsewhere also: <q>If we endure, we shall also reign with Him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 2:12</font></u></a></span> He has counted us worthy of the same things with the Son; and not only so, but what gives it greater force, with His Beloved Son. Those that were enemies, those that were in darkness, as it were on a sudden he had translated to where the Son is, to the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> with Him. Nor was he content with only this, in order to show the greatness of the gift; he was not content with saying, <q>kingdom,</q> but he also added, <q>of the Son</q>; nor yet with this, but he added also <q>beloved</q>; nor yet with this, but he added yet, the dignity of His nature. For what says he? <q>Who is the Image of the invisible God.</q> But he proceeded not to say this immediately, but meanwhile inserted the benefit which He bestowed upon us. For lest, when you hear that the whole is of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, you should suppose the Son excluded, he ascribes the whole to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and the whole to the Father. For He indeed translated us, but the Son furnished the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>. For what says he? <q>Who delivered us out of the power of darkness.</q> But the same is, <q>In whom we have the full redemption, even the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q> For had we not been forgiven our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, we should not have been <q>translated.</q> So here again the words, <q>In whom.</q> And he said not <q>redemption,</q> but <q>full redemption,</q> so that we shall not fall any more, nor become liable to death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Ver. 15</strong></font></u></a><strong><font size="4">.</font></strong> <q>Who is the image of the invisible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the First-born of all creation.</q></p>
<p>We light here upon a question of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresy</font></u></a>. So it were well we should put it off today and proceed with it tomorrow, addressing it to your ears when they are fresh.</p>
<p>But if one ought to say anything more: the work of the Son is the greater. How? Because it were a thing impossible to give the kingdom to men while continuing in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>; but thus it is an easier thing, so that He prepared the way for the gift. What do you say? He Himself loosed you from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>: surely then He Himself also has brought you near; already he has laid by anticipation the foundation of his doctrine.</p>
<p>But we must put a close to this discourse, when first we have made one remark. And what is this? Seeing we have come to enjoy so great a benefit, we ought to be ever mindful of it, and continually to turn in our minds the free gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and to reflect upon what we have been delivered from, what we have obtained; and so we shall be thankful; so we shall heighten our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward Him. What do you say, O man? You are called to a kingdom, to the kingdom of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>— and are you full of yawning, and scratching, and dozing? If need were that you should leap into ten thousand deaths every day, ought you not to endure all? For the sake of office you do all manner of things; when then you are going to share the kingdom of the Only-Begotten, will you not spring down upon ten thousand swords? Would you not leap into fire? And this is not all that is strange, but that when about to depart even, you bewail, and wouldest gladly dwell among the things which are here, being a lover of the body. What fancy is this? Do you regard even death as a thing of terror? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of this is luxury, ease: for he at least that should live an embittered life would wish even for wings, and to be loosed from hence. But now it is the same with us as with the spoiled nestlings, which would willingly remain for ever in the nest. But the longer they remain, the feebler they become. For the present life is a nest cemented together with sticks and mire. Yea, should you show me even the great mansions, yea the royal palace itself glittering with all its gold and precious stones; I shall think them no better than the nests of swallows, for when the winter has come they will all fall of themselves. By winter I mean That Day, not that it will be a winter to all. For God also calls it both night and day; the first in regard of sinners, the latter of the just. So do I also now call it winter. If in the summer we have not been well brought up, so as to be able to fly when winter has come, our mothers will not take us, but will leave us to die of hunger, or to perish when the nest falls; for easily as it were a nest, or rather more easily, will God in that day remove all things, undoing and new molding all. But they which are unfledged, and not able to meet Him in the air, but have been so grossly brought up that they have no lightness of wing, will suffer those things which reason is such characters should suffer. Now the brood of swallows, when they are fallen, perish quickly; but we shall not perish, but be punished for ever. That season will be winter; or rather, more severe than winter. For, not winter torrents of water roll down, but rivers of fire; not darkness that rises from clouds is there, but darkness that cannot be dispelled, and without a ray of light, so that they cannot see either the heaven, or the air, but are more straitened than those who have been buried in the earth.</p>
<p>Oftentimes do we say these things, but there are whom we cannot bring to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. But it is nothing wonderful if we, men of small account, are thus treated, when we discourse of such things, since the same happened to the Prophets also; when they spoke not of such matters only, but also of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and captivity. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer021.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 21:11</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer027.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">27:12</font></u></a>, etc.</span> And Zedekiah was rebuked by Jeremiah, and was not ashamed. Therefore the Prophets said, <q>Woe unto them that say, Let God hasten with speed His work, that we may see it, and let the counsel of the Holy One of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> come, that we may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa005.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 5:18-19</font></u></a></span> Let us not wonder at this. For neither did those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> who were in the days of the ark; they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, however, when their belief was of no gain to them; neither did they of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a> expect [their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a>], howbeit they too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, when they gained nothing by believing. And why do I speak of the future? Who would have expected these things which are now happening in various places; these earthquakes, these overthrows of cities? And yet were these things easier to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> than those; those, I mean, which happened in the days of the ark.</p>
<p>Whence is this evident? Because that the men of those times had no other example to look at, neither had they heard the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, but with us, on the other hand, are countless instances that have happened both in our own, and in former years. But whence arose the unbelief of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>? From a softened <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; they drank and ate, and therefore they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> not. For, what a man wishes, he thinks, and expects; and they that gainsay him are a jest.</p>
<p>But let it not be so with us; for hereafter it will not be a flood; nor the punishment till death only; but death will be the beginning of punishment for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not that there is a Judgment. And does any ask, who has come from thence, and said so? If now you speak thus in jest, not even so is it well; for one ought not to jest in such matters; and we jest, not where jesting is in place, but with peril; but if what thou really feelest, and you are of opinion that there is nothing hereafter, how is it that you call yourself a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>? For I take not into account those who are without. Why do you receive the Laver? Why do you set foot within the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>? Is it that we promise you magistracies? All our hope is in the things to come. Why then do you come, if you believe not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>? If you dost not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, I cannot call such an one a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>; God forbid! But worse than even Greeks. In what respect? In this; that when you think Christ is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, you believe Him not as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For in that other impiety there is at least consistency; for he who thinks not that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, necessarily will also not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> Him; but this impiety has not even consistency; to confess Him to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and yet not to think Him worthy of belief in what He has said; these are the words of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, of luxury, of riot. <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:32</font></u></a></span> Not tomorrow; but now you are dead, when you thus speak. Shall we then be in nothing different from swine and asses? Tell me. For if there be neither a judgment, nor a retribution, nor a tribunal, wherefore have we been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> with such a gift as reason, and have all things put under us? Why do we rule, and are they ruled? See how the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> is on every side urgent to persuade us to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the Gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He mixes together the slaves with their masters, like some man-stealer and ungrateful servant; he strives to degrade the free to the level of the criminal. And he seems indeed to be overthrowing the Judgment, but he is overthrowing the being of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>For such is ever the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil's</font></u></a> way; he puts forward everything in a wily, and not in a straightforward manner, to put us on our guard. If there is no Judgment, God is not just (I speak as a man): if God is not just, then there is no God at all: if there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, all things go on at haphazard, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is nought, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> nought. But he says nothing of this openly. Do you see the drift of this satanical argument? How, instead of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, he wishes to make us brutes, or rather, wild beasts, or rather, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>? Let us then not be persuaded by him. For there is a Judgment, O wretched and miserable man! I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> whence you come to use such words. You have committed many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, you have offended, you have no confidence, you think that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of things will even follow your arguments. Meanwhile, says he, I will not torment my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> with the expectation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and, if there be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, I will persuade it that there is none; meanwhile I will live here in luxury! Why do you add <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? If when you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a> you believe that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, you will depart with the penalty of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> only to pay; but if you add this further impiety, you will also for your impiety, and for this your thought, suffer the uttermost punishment; and what was a cold and shortlived comfort to you, will be a ground for your being punished for ever. You have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>: be it so: why do you encourage others also to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, by saying that there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>? Why did you mislead the simpler sort? Why unnerve the hands of the people? So far as you are concerned, everything is turned upside down; neither will the good become better, but listless; nor the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> desist from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. For, if we corrupt others, do we get allowance for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>? Do you see not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, how he attempted to bring down Adam? And has there then been allowance for him? Nay, surely it will be the occasion of a greater punishment, that he may be punished not for his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> only, but also for those of others. Let us not then suppose that to bring down others into the same destruction with ourselves will make the Judgment-seat more lenient to us. Surely this will make it more severe. Why thrust we ourselves on destruction? The whole of this comes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>O man, have you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>? You have for your Master One that loves man. Entreat, implore, weep, groan; and terrify others, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> them that they fall not into the same. If in a house some servant, of those that had offended their master, says to his son, <q>My child, I have offended the master, do thou be careful to please him, that you be not as I</q>: tell me, will he not have some forgiveness? will he not bend and soften his master? But if, leaving so to speak, he shall say such words as these, that he will not requite every one according to his deserts; that all things are jumbled together indiscriminately, both good and bad; that there is no thanks in this house; what do you think will be the master's mind concerning him? will he not suffer a severer punishment for his own misdoings? Justly so; for in the former case his feeling will plead for him, though it be but weakly; but in this, nobody. If no other then, yet imitate at least that rich man in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, who said, <q>Father <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, send to my kinsmen, lest they come into this place,</q> since he could not go himself, so that they might not fall into the same condemnation. Let us have done with such Satanical words.</p>
<p>What then, says he, when the Greeks put questions to us; would you not that we should try to cure them? But by casting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> into perplexity, under pretense of curing the Greek, you aim at establishing your Satanical doctrine. For since, when communing with your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> alone of these things, you persuade her not; you desire to bring forward others as witnesses. But if one must reason with a Greek, the discussion should not begin with this; but whether Christ be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>; whether those gods of theirs be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>. If these points be established, all the others follow; but, before making good the beginning, it is vain to dispute about the end; before learning the first elements, it is superfluous and unprofitable to come to the conclusion. The Greek disbelieves the Judgment, and he is in the same case with yourself, seeing that he too has many who have treated these things in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>; and albeit when they so spoke they held the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as separated from the body, still they set up a seat of judgment. And the thing is so very clear, that no one scarcely is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of it, but both poets and all are agreed among themselves that there is both a Tribunal and a Judgment. So that the Greek also disbelieves his own authorities; and the Jew does not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> about these things nor in a word does any man.</p>
<p>Why then deceive we ourselves? See, you say these things to me. What will you say to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>that fashioned our hearts one by one</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa032.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 33:15</font></u></a></span>; that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> everything that is in the mind; <q>that is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb004.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 4:12</font></u></a></span> For tell me with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>; Do you not condemn yourself? And how should wisdom so great, as that one who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> should condemn himself, come by chance, for this is a work of mighty wisdom. You condemn yourself. And will he who gives you such thoughts leave everything to go on at hazard? The following rule then will hold universally and strictly. Not one of those who live in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> wholly disbelieves the doctrine of the Judgment, even though he be Greek or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a>. None, save a few, of those who live in great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, receives the doctrine of the Resurrection. And this is what the Psalmist says, <q>Your judgments are taken away from before his face.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa009.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 10:5</font></u></a></span> Wherefore? Because <q>his ways are always profane</q>; for he says, <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</q></p>
<p>Do you see that thus to speak is the mark of the grovelling? Of eating and drinking come these sayings which are subversive of the Resurrection. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> endures not, I say, it endures not the tribunal which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> supplies, and so it is with it, as with a murderer, who firsts suggests to himself that he shall not be detected, and so goes on to slay; for had his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> been his judge, he would not hastily have come to that daring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. And still he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>, and pretends not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, lest he should be tortured by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, for, certainly, in that case, he would have been less resolute for the daring deed. So too, assuredly, they who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and day by day wallow in the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, are unwilling to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it, although their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">consciences</font></u></a> pluck at them.</p>
<p>But let us give no heed to such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, for there will be, there will assuredly be, a Judgment and a Resurrection, and God will not leave so great works without direction. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us leave off <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, and lay fast hold on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that we may receive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> doctrine in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>. And yet, which is easier to receive? The doctrine of the Resurrection, or that of Fate? The latter is full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>, of absurdity, of cruelty, of inhumanity; the other of righteousness, awarding according to desert; and still men do not receive it. But the fault is, indolence, for no one that has understanding receives the other. For among the Greeks even, they who did receive that doctrine, were those who in their definition of pleasure affirmed it to be the <q>end,</q> but they who loved <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, would not receive it, but they cast it out as absurd. But if among the Greeks this were so, much more will it hold good with the doctrine of the Resurrection. And observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, how the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> has established two contrary things: for in order that we may neglect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; and pay <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, he brought in this Necessity, and by means of each he procured the belief of both. What reason then will he be able to give, who obstinately disbelieves a thing so admirable, and is persuaded by those who talk so idly? Do not then support yourself with the consolation, that you will meet with forgiveness; but let us, collecting all our strength, stir ourselves up to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and let us live <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, etc.</p>

<p><q>Who is the Image of the invisible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the Firstborn of all creation: for in Him were all things created, in the heavens, and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things have been created through Him, and unto Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Today it is necessary for me to pay the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230303.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">debt</font></u></a>, which yesterday I deferred, in order that I might address it to your minds when in full force. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, discoursing as we showed of the dignity of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, says these words: <q>Who is the Image of the invisible God.</q> Whose image then will you have Him be? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230303.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>'s? Then he is exactly like the one to whom you assign Him. For if as a man's image, say so, and I will have done with you as a madman. But if as God and God's Son, God's image, he shows the exact <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230303.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">likeness</font></u></a>. Wherefore has no Angel anywhere been called either <q>image</q> or <q>son,</q> but man both? Wherefore? Because in the former case indeed the exaltedness of their nature might presently have thrust the many into this impiety ; but in the other case the mean and low nature is a pledge of security against this, and will not allow any, even should they desire it, to suspect anything of the kind, nor to bring down the Word so low. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, where the meanness is great, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> boldly asserts the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, but where the nature is higher, it forbears. <q>The Image of the Invisible</q> is itself also invisible, and invisible in like manner, for otherwise it would not be an image. For an image, so far as it is an image, even among us, ought to be exactly similar, as, for example, in respect of the features and the likeness. But here indeed among us, this is by no means possible; for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> art fails in many respects, or rather fails in all, if you examine with accuracy. But where God is, there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, no failure.</p>
<p>But if a creature: how is He the Image of the Creator? For neither is a horse the image of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>. If <q>the Image</q> mean not exact likeness to the Invisible, what hinders the Angels also from being His Image? For they too are invisible; but not to one another: but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is invisible: but because it is invisible, it is simply on that account an image, and not in such sort as he and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> are images. </p>
<p><q>The Firstborn of all creation.</q> <q>What then,</q> says one, <q>Lo, He is a creature.</q> Whence? Tell me. <q>Because he said 'Firstborn.' </q>However, he said not <q>first created,</q> but <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a>.</q> Then it is reasonable that he should be called many things. For he must also be called a brother <q>in all things.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb002.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 2:17</font></u></a></span> And we must take from Him His being Creator; and insist that neither in dignity nor in any other thing is He superior to us? And who that has understanding would say this? For the word <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a></q> is not expressive of dignity and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, nor of anything else, but of time only. What does <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a></q> signify? That he is created, is the answer. Well. If then this be so, it has also kindred expressions. But otherwise the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a> is of the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">essence</font></u></a> with those of whom he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a>. Therefore he will be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a> son of all things— for it said <q>of every creature</q>; therefore of stones also, and of me, is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God the Word</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a>. But again, of what, tell me, are the words <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a> from the dead</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:18</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:29</font></u></a></span> declaratory? Not that He first rose; for he said not simply, <q>of the dead,</q> but <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a> from the dead,</q> nor yet, <q>that He died first,</q> but that He rose the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a> from the dead. So that they declare nothing else than this, that He is the Firstfruits of the Resurrection. Surely then neither in the place before us. Next he proceeds to the doctrine itself. For that they may not think Him to be of more recent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a>, because that in former times the approach was through Angels, but now through Him; he shows first, that they had no power (for else it had not been <q>out of darkness</q> <span>ver. 13</span> that he brought), next, that He is also before them. And he uses as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of His being before them, this; that they were created by him. <q>For in Him,</q> he says, <q>were all things created.</q> What say here the followers of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11589a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul of Samosata</font></u></a>? <q>The things in the heavens.</q> What was in question, he has placed first; <q>and the things upon the earth.</q> Then he says, <q>the visible and the invisible things</q>; invisible, such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and all that has come to exist in heaven; visible, such as men, sun, sky. <q>Whether thrones.</q> And what is granted, he lets alone, but what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> he asserts. <q>Whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers.</q> The words <q>whether,</q> <q>or,</q> comprehend the whole of things; but by means of the greater things show it of the less also. But the Spirit is not among the <q>powers.</q> <q>All things,</q> he says, <q>have been created through Him, and unto Him.</q> Lo, <q>in Him,</q> is <q>through Him,</q> for having said <q>in Him,</q> he added, <q>through Him.</q> But what <q>unto Him</q>? It is this; the subsistence of all things depends on Him. Not only did He Himself bring them out of nothing into being, but Himself sustains them now, so that were they dissevered from His Providence, they were at once undone and destroyed. But He said not, <q>He continues them,</q> which had been a grosser way of speaking, but what is more subtle, that <q>on</q> Him they depend. To have only a bearing on Him is enough to continue anything and bind it fast. So also the word <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a>,</q> in the sense of a foundation. But this does not show the creatures to be consubstantial with Him; but that all things are through Him, and in Him are upheld. Since <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also when he says elsewhere, <q>I have laid a foundation</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co003.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 3:10</font></u></a></span>, is speaking not concerning substance, but operation. For, that you may not think Him to be a minister, he says that He continues them, which is not less than making them. Certainly, with us it is greater even: for to the former, art conducts us; but to the latter, not so, it does not even stay a thing in decay.</p>
<p><q>And He is before all things,</q> he says. This is befitting God. Where is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11589a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul of Samosata</font></u></a>? <q>And in Him all things consist,</q> that is, they are created into Him. He repeats these expressions in close sequence; with their close succession, as it were with rapid strokes, tearing up the deadly doctrine by the roots. For, if even when such great things had been declared, still after so long a time <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11589a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul of Samosata</font></u></a> sprung up, how much more [would such have been the case], had not these things been said before? <q>And in Him,</q> he says, <q>all things consist.</q> How <q>consist</q> in one who was not? So that the things also done through Angels are of Him.</p>
<p><q>And He is the head of the body, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Then having spoken of His dignity, he afterwards speaks of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to man also. <q>He is,</q> says he, <q>the Head of the body, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> And he said not <q>of the fullness,</q> (although this too is signified,) out of a wish to show His great friendliness to us, in that He who is thus above, and above all, connected Himself with those below. For everywhere He is first; above first; in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> first, for He is the Head; in the Resurrection first. That is,</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Ver. 18</strong></font></u></a><strong><font size="4">.</font></strong> <q>That He might have the preëminence.</q> So that in generation also He is first. And this is what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> is chiefly endeavoring to show. For if this be made good, that He was before all the Angels; then there is brought in along with it this also as a consequence, that He did their works by commanding them. And what is indeed wonderful, he makes a point to show that He is first in the later generation. Although elsewhere he calls <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> first <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse45" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:45</font></u></a></span>, as in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> he is; but here he takes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> for the whole race of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. For He is first of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; and first of men after the flesh, like as of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230303.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Creation</font></u></a>. And therefore he here uses the word <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">firstborn</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What is in this place the meaning of <q>the Firstborn</q>? Who was created first, or rose before all; as in the former place it means, Who was before all things. And here indeed he uses the word <q>firstfruits,</q> saying, <q>Who is the Firstfruits, the Firstborn from the dead, that in all things He might have the preëminence,</q> showing that the rest also are such as He; but in the former place it is not the <q>Firstfruits</q> of creation. And it is there, <q>The Image of the invisible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and then, <q>Firstborn.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Ver. 19, 20.</font></strong> <q>For it was the good pleasure of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, that in Him should all the fullness dwell. And having made peace through the Blood of His Cross, through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.</q></p>
<p>Whatsoever things are of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, these he says are of the Son also, and that with more of intensity, because that He both became <q>dead</q> for, and united Himself to us. He said, <q>Firstfruits,</q> as of fruits. He said not <q>Resurrection,</q> but <q>Firstfruits,</q> showing that He has sanctified us all, and offered us, as it were, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>. The term <q>fullness</q> some use of the Godhead, like as John said, <q>Of His fullness have all we received.</q> That is, whatever was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, the whole Son dwelt there, not a sort of energy, but a Substance.</p>
<p>He has no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to assign but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>: for this is the import of, <q>it was the good pleasure...in Him. And...through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself.</q> Lest you should think that He undertook the office of a minister only, he says, <q>unto Himself.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co005.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 5:18</font></u></a></span> And yet he elsewhere says, that He reconciled us to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as in the Epistle he wrote to the Corinthians. And he well said, <q>Through Him to make an end of reconciling</q>; for they were already reconciled; but completely, he says, and in such sort, as no more to be at enmity with Him. How? For not only the reconciliation was set forth, but also the manner of the reconciliation. <q>Having made peace through the Blood of His Cross.</q> The word <q>reconcile,</q> shows the enmity; the words <q>having made peace,</q> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>. <q>Through the Blood of His Cross, through Himself, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.</q> A great thing indeed it is to reconcile; but that this should be through Himself too, is a greater thing; and a greater still—how through Himself? Through His Blood. Through His Blood; and he said not simply His Blood, but what is yet greater, through the Cross. So that the marvels are five: He reconciled us; to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; through Himself; through Death; through the Cross. Admirable again! How he has mixed them up! For lest you should think that it is one thing merely, or that the Cross is anything of itself, he says <q>through Himself.</q> How well he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that this was a great thing. Because not by speaking words, but by giving Himself up for the reconciliation, He so wrought everything.</p>
<p>But what is <q>things in the heavens</q>? For with reason indeed is it said, <q>the things upon the earth,</q> for those were filled with enmity, and manifoldly divided, and each one of us was utterly at variance with himself, and with the many; but how made He peace among <q>the things in the heavens</q>? Was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and battle there also? How then do we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, saying, <q>Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:10</font></u></a></span> What is it then? The earth was divided from heaven, the Angels had become enemies to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, through seeing the Lord insulted. <q>To sum up,</q> he says, <q>all things in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 1:10</font></u></a></span> How? The things in heaven indeed in this way: He translated Man there, He brought up to them the enemy, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> one. Not only made He the things on earth to be at peace, but He brought up to them him that was their enemy and foe. Here was peace profound. Angels again appeared on the earth thereafter, because that Man too had appeared in heaven. And it seems to me that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was caught up on this account <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co012.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 12:2</font></u></a></span>, and to show that the Son also had been received up there. For in the earth indeed, the peace was twofold; with the things of heaven, and with themselves; but in heaven it was simple. For if the Angels <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> over one sinner that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04347a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">repents</font></u></a>, much more will they over so many.</p>
<p>All this God's power has wrought. Why then place ye confidence in Angels? says he. For so far are they from bringing you near, that they were ever your enemies, except God Himself had reconciled you with them. Why then run ye to them? Would you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> which the Angels had against us, how great it was; and how averse to us they always were? They were sent to take vengeance in the cases of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a>, of David, of the Sodomites, of the Valley of weeping. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo023.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 23:20</font></u></a></span> Not so however now, but, on the contrary, they sang upon the earth <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2sa024.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Samuel 24:16</font></u></a></span> with exceeding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>. And He led these down to men <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen019.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 19:13</font></u></a></span>, and led men up to them.</p>
<p>And observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, the marvel in this: He brought these first down hither, and then he took up man to them; earth became heaven, because that heaven was about to receive the things of earth. Therefore when we give thanks, we say, <q>Glory to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to men.</q> Behold, he says, even men appeared well-pleasing to Him thereafter. What is <q>good will</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph002.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 2:14</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu032.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 32:8</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13722a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Septuagint</font></u></a></span> Reconciliation. No longer is the heaven a wall of partition. At first the Angels were according to the number of the nations; but now, not to the number of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nations</font></u></a>, but that of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>. Whence is this evident? Hear Christ saying, <q>See that you despise not one of these little ones, for their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:10</font></u></a></span> For each believer has an Angel; since even from the beginning, every one of those that were approved had his Angel, as Jacob says, <q>The Angel that feeds me, and delivers me from my youth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen048.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 48:15-16</font></u></a></span>, nearly If then we have Angels, let us be sober, as though we were in the presence of tutors; for there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> present also. Therefore we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, asking for the Angel of peace, and everywhere we ask for peace (for there is nothing equal to this); peace, in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Churches</font></u></a>, in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, in the supplications, in the salutations; and once, and twice, and thrice, and many times, does he that is over the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> give it, <q>Peace be unto you.</q> Wherefore? Because this is the Mother of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things; this is the foundation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>. Therefore Christ also commanded the Apostles on entering into the houses straightway to say this, as being a sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things; for He says, <q>When ye come into the houses, say, Peace be unto you;</q> for where this is wanting, everything is useless. And to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> Christ said, <q>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 14:27</font></u></a></span> This prepares the way for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. And he that is over the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, says not, <q>Peace be unto you,</q> simply, but <q>Peace be unto all.</q> For what if with this man we have peace, but with another, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and fighting? What is the gain? For neither in the body, should some of its elements be at rest and others in a state of variance, is it possible that health should ever be upheld; but only when the whole of them are in good order, and harmony, and peace, and except the whole are at rest, and continue within their proper limits, all will be overturned. And, further, in our minds, except all our thoughts are at rest, peace will not exist. So great a good is peace, as that the makers and producers of it are called the sons of God <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:9-45</font></u></a></span>, with reason; because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> came upon the earth, to set at peace the things in the earth, and those in the heavens. But if the peacemakers are the sons of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the makers of disturbance are sons of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>What do you say? Do you excite contentions and fightings? And does any ask who is so unhappy? Many there are who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and who do rather rend in pieces the Body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, than did the soldiers pierce it with the spear, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> who struck it through with the nails. A less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> was that than this; those Members, so cut through, again united, but these when torn off, if they be not united here, will never be united, but remain apart from the Fullness. When you are minded to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against your brother, bethink you that you war against the members of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and cease from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>. For what if he be an outcast? What if he be vile? What if he be open to contempt? So says He, <q>It is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of My Father that one of these little ones should perish.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:14</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:10</font></u></a></span> God for his sake and yours even became a servant, and was slain; and do you consider him to be nothing? Surely in this respect also you fight against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in that you deliver a judgment contrary to His. When he that is over the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> comes in, he straightway says, <q>Peace unto all</q>; when he preaches, <q>Peace unto all</q>; when he blesses, <q>Peace unto all</q>; when he bids to salute, <q>Peace unto all</q>; when the Sacrifice is finished, <q>Peace unto all</q>: and again, in the middle, <q>Grace to you and peace.</q> How then is it not monstrous, if, while hearing so many times that we are to have peace, we are in a state of feud with each other; and receiving peace, and giving it back, are at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with him that gives it to us? You say, <q>And to your spirit.</q> And do you traduce him abroad? Woe is me! That the majestic usages of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> have become forms of things merely, not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>. Woe is me! That the watchwords of this army proceed no farther than to be only words. Whence also you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> wherefore is said, <q>Peace unto all.</q> But hear what follows, what Christ says; <q>And into whatsoever city or village you shall enter...as you enter into the house, salute it; and if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:11-13</font></u></a></span> We are therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>; because we look upon this merely as a figure of words; and we assent not to them in our minds. For do I give the Peace? It is Christ who deigns to speak by us. Even if at all other times we are void of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, yet are we not now, for your sakes. For if the Grace of God wrought in an ass and a diviner, for the sake of an economy, and the advantage of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num022.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 22</font></u></a></span>, it is quite clear that it will not refuse to operate even in us, but for your sakes will endure even this.</p>
<p>Let none say then that I am mean, and low, and worthy of no consideration, and in such a frame of mind attend to me. For such I am; but God's way always is, to be present even with such for the sake of the many.

<p>Do not, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, think that these things are spoken from us; it is the Grace of God which works in the unworthy, not for our sakes, but for yours.

But so long as we sit upon this throne, so long as we have the first place, we have both the dignity and the power, even though we are unworthy. If the throne of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> was of such reverence, that for its sake they were to be heard, much more the throne of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. It, we have received by succession; from it we speak; since the time that Christ has vested in us the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Ambassadors, whatever be their sort, because of the dignity of an embassy, enjoy much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. For observe; they go alone into the heart of the land of barbarians, through the midst of so many enemies; and because the law of embassy is of mighty power, all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> them; all look towards them with respect, all send them forth with safety. And we now have received a word of embassy, and we have come from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, for this is the dignity of the Episcopate. We have come to you on an embassy, requesting you to put an end to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and we say on what terms; not promising to give cities, nor so and so many measures of grain, nor slaves, nor gold; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life, society with Christ, the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, which neither are we able to tell you, so long as we are in this flesh, and the present life. Ambassadors then we are, and we wish to enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, not for our own sakes, far be it, for we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> its worthlessness, but for yours; that you may hear with earnestness the things we say; that you may be profited, that not with listlessness or indifference ye may attend to what is spoken. See ye not ambassadors, how all pay court to them? We are God's ambassadors to men; but, if this offend you, not we, but the Episcopate itself, not this man or that, but the Bishop.

<div><strong><font size="4">Colossians 1:21, 22</font></strong> </div>
<p><q><em>And you, being in time past, enemies and alienated</em> <em>in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> works, yet now has He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish and unreprovable before Him.</em></q></p>
<p>Here he goes to show that He reconciled those even who were unworthy of reconciliation. For by the saying that they were under the power of darkness, he shows the calamity in which they were. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:13</font></u></a></span> But lest, on hearing of <q>the power of darkness,</q> you should consider it Necessity, he adds, <q>And you that were alienated,</q> so that though it appear to be the same thing that he says, yet it is not so; for it is not the same thing to deliver out of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> him that through necessity came to suffer, and him that of his own will endures. For the former indeed is worthy to be pitied, but the latter <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>. But nevertheless, he says, you that are not against your wills, nor from compulsion, but with your wills, and wishes, sprang away from Him, and are unworthy of it, He has reconciled. And seeing he had made mention of the <q>things in the heavens,</q> he shows, that all the enmity had its origin from hence, not thence. For they indeed were long ago desirous, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230304.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> also, but you were not willing.</p>
<p>And throughout he is showing that the Angels had no power in the successive times, forasmuch as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230304.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> continued enemies; they could neither persuade them, nor, if persuaded, could they deliver them from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. For neither would persuading them be any gain, except he that held them were bound; nor would binding him have been of any service, except they whom he detained were willing to return. But both of these were needed, and they could do neither of them, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230304.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> did both. So that even more marvelous than loosing death, is the persuading them. For the former was wholly of Himself, and the power lay wholly in Himself, but of the latter, not in Himself alone, but in us also; but we accomplish those things more easily of which the power lies in ourselves. Therefore, as being the greater, he puts it last. And he said not simply <q>were at enmity,</q> but <q>were alienated,</q> which denotes great enmity, nor yet <q>alienated</q> [only], but without any expectation even of returning. <q>And enemies in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>,</q> he says; then the alienation had not proceeded so far as purpose only— but what? <q>in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> works</q> also. You were both enemies, he says, and you did the works of enemies.</p>
<p><q>Yet now has He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death to present you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish and unreprovable before Him.</q> Again he lays down also the manner of the reconciliation, that it was <q>in the Body,</q> not by being merely beaten, nor scourged, nor sold, but even by dying a death the most shameful. Again he makes mention of the Cross, and again lays down another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230304.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">benefit</font></u></a>. For He did not only <q>deliver,</q> but, as he says above, <q>Who made us meet</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:12</font></u></a></span>, to the same he alludes here also. <q>Through</q> His <q>death,</q> he says, <q>to present you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish and unreprovable before Him.</q> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a>, He has not only delivered from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, but has also placed among the approved. For, not that He might deliver us from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> only, did He suffer so great things, but that also we might obtain the first rewards; as if one should not only free a condemned criminal from his punishment, but also advance him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. And he has ranked you with those who have not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, yea rather not with those who have done no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> only, but even with those who have wrought the greatest righteousness; and, what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> a great thing, has given the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> which is before Him, and the being unreprovable. Now an advance upon unblamable is unreprovable, when we have done nothing either to be condemned for, or charged with. But, since he ascribed the whole to Him, because through His death He achieved these things; <q>what then, says one, is it to us? We need nothing.</q> Therefore he added,</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Ver. 23</strong></font></u></a><strong><font size="4">.</font></strong> <q>If so be that you continue in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Here he strikes a blow at their listlessness. And he said not simply <q>continue,</q> for it is possible to continue wavering, and vacillating; it is possible to stand, and continue, though turned this way and that. <q>If so be that you continue,</q> he says, <q>grounded and steadfast, and not moved away.</q> Wonderful! What a forcible metaphor he uses; he says not only not tossed to and fro, but not even moved. And observe, he lays down so far nothing burdensome, nor toilsome, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and hope; that is, if you continue believing, that the hope of the things to come is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>. For this indeed is possible; but, as regards <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> living, it is not possible to avoid being shaken about, though it be but a little; so (what he enjoins) is not grievous.</p>
<p><q>From the hope,</q> he says, <q>of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, which you heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven.</q> But what is the hope of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, except Christ? For He Himself is our peace, that has wrought all these things: so that he who ascribes them to others is <q>moved away</q>: for he has lost all, unless he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. <q>Which ye heard,</q> he says. And again he brings themselves as witnesses, then the whole world. He says not, <q>which is being preached,</q> but has already been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> and preached. As he did also at the outset <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:6</font></u></a></span>, being desirous by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the many to establish these also. <q>Whereof I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was made a minister.</q> This also contributes to make it credible; <q>I,</q> says he, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> a minister.</q> For great was his authority, as being now everywhere celebrated, and the teacher of the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Ver. 24</strong></font></u></a><strong><font size="4">.</font></strong> <q>Now I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body's sake, which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>And what is the connection of this? It seems indeed not to be connected, but it is even closely so. And <q>minister,</q> he says, that is, bringing in nothing from myself, but announcing what is from another. I so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, that I suffer even for His sake, and not suffer only, but even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in suffering, looking unto the hope which is to come, and I suffer not for myself, but for you. <q>And fill up,</q> he says, <q>that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.</q> It seems indeed to be a great thing he has said; but it is not of arrogancy, far be it, but even of much tender <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards Christ; for he will not have the sufferings to be his own, but His, through desire of conciliating these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to Him. And what things I suffer, I suffer, he says, on His account: not to me, therefore, express your gratitude, but to him, for it is He Himself who suffers. Just as if one, when sent to a person, should make request to another, saying, I beseech you, go for me to this person, then the other should say, <q>it is on his account I am doing it.</q> So that He is not ashamed to call these sufferings also his own. For He did not only die for us, but even after His death He is ready to be afflicted for your sakes. He is eagerly and vehemently set upon showing that He is even now exposed to peril in His own Body for the Church's sake, and he aims at this point, namely, you are not brought unto God by us, but by Him, even though we do these things, for we have not undertaken a work of our own, but His. And it is the same as if there were a band which had its allotted leader to protect it, and it should stand in battle, and then when he had gone, his lieutenant should succeed to his wounds until the battle were brought to a close.</p>
<p>Next, that for His sake also he does these things, hearken: <q>For His Body's sake,</q> he says, assuredly meaning to say this: <q>I pleasure not you, but Christ: for what things He should have suffered, I suffer instead of Him.</q> See how many things he establishes. Great, he shows, is the claim upon their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. As in his second Epistle to the Corinthians, he wrote, saying, <q>he committed unto us the ministry of reconciliation</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co005.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 5:20</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>We are ambassadors on behalf of Christ; as though God were entreating by us.</q> So also here he says, <q>For his sake I suffer,</q> that he may the more draw them to Him. That is, though He who is your debtor is gone away, yet I repay. For, on this account he also said, <q>that which is lacking,</q> to show that not even yet does he consider Him to have suffered all. <q>For your sake,</q> he says, and even after His death He suffers; seeing that still there remains a deficiency. The same thing he does in another way in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, <q>Who also makes intercession for us</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:34</font></u></a></span>, showing that He was not satisfied with His death alone, but even afterwards He does countless things.</p>
<p>He does not then say this to exalt himself, but through a desire to show that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is even yet caring for them. And he shows what he says to be credible, by adding, <q>for His Body's sake.</q> For that so it is, and that there is no unlikelihood in it, is plain from these things being done for His body's sake. Look how He has knitted us unto Himself. Why then introduce Angels between? <q>Whereof I was made,</q> he says, <q>a minister.</q> Why introduce Angels besides? <q>I am a minister.</q> Then he shows that he had himself done nothing, albeit he is a minister. <q>Of which I was made,</q> says he, <q>a minister, according to the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> which is given me to youward, to fulfill the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <q>The dispensation.</q> Either he means, He so willed that after His own departure we should succeed to the dispensation, in order that you might not feel as deserted, (for it is Himself that suffers, Himself that is ambassador;) or he means this, namely, me who was more than all a persecutor, for this end He permitted to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecute</font></u></a>, that in my preaching I might gain belief; or by <q>dispensation</q> he means, that He required not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, nor actions, nor good works, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>. For you would not otherwise have received the word. <q>For you,</q> he says, <q>to fulfill the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> He speaks of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, showing that they were yet wavering, by the expression, <q>fulfill.</q> For that the cast-away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> should have been able to receive such lofty doctrines was not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, but of the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; <q>for I never could have had the power,</q> he says. Having shown that which is greater, that his sufferings are Christ's, he next subjoins what is more evident, that this also is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>to fulfill His word in you.</q> And he shows here covertly, that this too is of dispensation, that it is spoken to you now, when you are able to hear it, and comes not of neglect, but to the end ye may receive it. For God does not all things on a sudden, but uses condescension because of His plenteous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man. And this is the reason why Christ came at this time, and not of old. And He shows in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, that for this reason He sent the servants first, that they might not proceed to kill the Son. For if they did not reverence the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, even when He came after the servants, much less would they had He come sooner; if they gave no heed to the lesser commandments, how would they to the greater? What then, does one object? Are there not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> even now, and Greeks who are in a very imperfect condition? This, however, is an excess of listlessness. For after so long a time, after such great instructions, still to continue imperfect, is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of great stupidity.</p>
<p>When then the Greeks say, why did Christ come at this time? Let us not allow them so to speak, but let us ask them, whether He did not succeed? For as, if He had come at the very first, and had not succeeded, the time would not have been for us a sufficient excusation, so, seeing He has succeeded, we cannot with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> be brought to account on the score of <q>the time.</q> For neither does any one demand of a physician, who has removed the disease, and restored one to health, to give an account of his treatment, nor yet does any examine closely a general who has gained a victory, why at this time, and why in this place. For these things it were in place to ask, had he not been successful; but when he has been successful, they must even be taken for granted. For, tell me, whether is more worthy of credit, your reasoning and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumny</font></u></a>, or the perfection of the thing? Conquered He, or conquered He not? Show this. Prevailed He, or prevailed He not? Accomplished He what He said, or no? These are the articles of enquiry. Tell me, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>. Thou fully grantest that God is, even though not Christ? I ask you then; Is God without beginning? You will say, Certainly. Tell me then, why made He not men myriads of years before? For they would have lived through a longer time. They were now losers by that time during which they were not. Nay, they were not losers; but how, He who made them alone <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>. Again, I ask you, why did He not make all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> at once? But his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, whoever was first made, has so many years of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a>, of which that one is deprived which is not yet created. Wherefore made He the one to be brought first into this world, and the other afterwards?</p>
<p>Although these things are really fit subjects for enquiry: yet not for a meddling curiosity: for this is not for enquiry at all. For I will tell you the reason I spoke of. For suppose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> as being some one continued life, and that in the first times our race was in the position of boyhood; in those that succeeded, of manhood; and in these that are near extreme age, of an old man. Now when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is at its perfection, when the limbs of the body are unstrung, and our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> is over, we are then brought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>. On the contrary, one may say, we teach boys while young. Yes, but not the great doctrines, but rhetoric, and expertness with language; and the other when they have come to ripeness of age. See God also doing the same with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. For just as though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> had been little children, he placed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> over them as a schoolmaster, and like little children he managed these things for them through shadowy representations, as we teach letters. <q>For the law had a shadow of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, and not the very image of the things.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb010.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 10:1</font></u></a></span> As we both buy cakes for children and give them pieces of money, requiring of them one thing only, that for the present they would go to school; so also God at that time gave them both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and luxury, purchasing from them by this His great indulgence one only thing, that they would listen to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. Therefore He delivered them over to a schoolmaster, that they might not despise Himself as a tender, loving Father. See then that they feared him only; for they said not, Where is God? But, Where is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>? And his very presence was fearful. So when they did amiss, observe how he punished them. For God indeed was desirous of casting them off; but he would not permit Him. Or rather the whole was of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; just as when a Father threatens while a schoolmaster entreats Him, and says, <q>Forgive them, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, on my account, and henceforward I undertake for them.</q> In this way was the wilderness a school. And as children who have been a long while at school are desirous of quitting it, so also were they at that time continually desiring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and weeping, saying, <q>We are lost, we are wholly consumed, we are utterly undone.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo016.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 16:3</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> broke their tablet, having written for them, as it were, certain words <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo032.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 32:19</font></u></a></span>; just as a schoolmaster would do, who having taken up the writing tablet, and found it badly written, throws away the tablet itself, desiring to show great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>; and if he have broken it, the father is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>. For he indeed was busy writing, but they not attending to him, but turning themselves other ways, were committing disorder. And as in school, they strike each other, so also, on that occasion, he bade them strike and slay each other. And again, having given them as it were lessons to learn, then asking for them, and finding they had not learned them, he would punish them. For instance. What writings were those that denoted the power of God? The events in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>? Yes, says one, but these writings represented the plagues, that He punishes His enemies. And to them it was a school. For what else was the punishment of your enemies but your benefit? And in other respects too, He benefited you. And it was the same as if one should say he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> his letters, but when asked up and down, should be at fault, and be beaten. So they also said indeed that they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but when asked their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> up and down, they could not give it, and therefore were beaten. Have you seen water? You ought to be reminded of the water in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. For He that of water made blood, will be also of power to do this. As we also say often to the children, <q>when in a book you see the letter A, remember that you had it in your tablet.</q> Have you seen famine? Remember that it was He that destroyed the crops! Have you seen <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>? Remember the drowning! Have you seen that they are mighty who inhabit the land? But not mightier than the Egyptians. He who took you out of the midst of them, will He not much more save you when out? But they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not how to answer their letters out of order, and therefore they were beaten. <q>They ate,</q> and drank, <q>and kicked.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu032.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 32:15</font></u></a></span> When fed with their manna they ought not to have asked for luxury, seeing they had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> which proceed from it. And they acted precisely as if a free child, when sent to school, should ask to be reckoned with the slaves, and to wait on them—so did these also in seeking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>— and when receiving all needful sustenance, and such as becomes a free person, and sitting at his father's table, should have a longing for the ill-savored and noisy one of the servants. And they said to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, <q>Yea, Lord, all that you have spoken will we do, and be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo024.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 24:7</font></u></a></span> And as it happens in the case of desperately bad children, that when the father would put them to death, the schoolmaster perseveringly entreats for them, the same was the case at that time also.</p>
<p>Why have we said these things? Because we differ in nothing from children. Will you hear their doctrines also, that they are those of children? <q>Eye for eye,</q> it is said, <q>and tooth for tooth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/lev024.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Leviticus 24:20</font></u></a></span> For nothing is so eager to revenge as a childish mind. For seeing it is a passion of irrationality, and there is much irrationality, and great lack of consideration in that age, no wonder the child is tyrannized over by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>; and so great is the tyranny, that ofttimes after stumbling and getting up again, they will smite their knee for passion, or overturn the footstool, and so will allay their pain, and quench their rage. In some such way as this did God also deal with them, when He allowed them to strike out <q>Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,</q> and destroyed the Egyptians and the Amalekites that had grieved them. And He promised such things; as if to one who said, <q>Father, such and such an one has beaten me,</q> the father should then reply, <q>Such and such an one is a bad man, and let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> him.</q> So also does God say, <q>I will be their enemy that are your enemies, and I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo023.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 23:22</font></u></a></span> And again, when Balaam <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>, the condescension which was used towards them was childish. For as with children, when having been frightened at anything not frightful, such as either a lock of wool, or any other thing of like sort, they are suddenly alarmed; that their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> may not continue in them, we bring the thing up to their hands, and make their nurses show it them: so also did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; seeing that the Prophet was a terror to them, he turned the terror of him into confidence. And as children who are under weaning have all manner of things in little baskets, so also did He give them everything, and dainties in abundance. Still the child longs for the breast; so did these also for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> and the flesh that was there.</p>
<p>So that one would not be wrong in calling <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> both a teacher, and a nursing-father, and a conductor <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo016.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 16:3</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num011.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 11:4-5</font></u></a></span>; the man's wisdom was great. Howbeit it is not the same thing to guide men who are already <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a>, and to rule unreasoning children. And, if you are inclined to hear yet another particular; as the nurse says to the child, When you ease yourself, take up your garments, and for as long as you sit, so also did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu023.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 23:13</font></u></a></span> For all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> are tyrannous in children (for as yet they have not that which is to bridle them), vainglory, desire, irrationality, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>; just as in children, so they prevailed; they spat upon, they beat, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. And as a child takes up a stone, and we all exclaim, O do not throw it; so did they also take up stones against their father; and he fled from them. And as, if a father have any ornament, the child, being fond of ornament, asks him for it, in like manner, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a>, did the party of Dathan and Abiram act, when they rebelled for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priesthood</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num016.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 16</font></u></a></span> And besides, they were of all people the most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, and little-minded, and in all respects imperfect.</p>
<p>Ought then Christ, tell me, to have appeared at that time, at that time to have given them these teachings of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom, when they were raging with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, when they were as horses mad for the mare, when they were the slaves of money, of the belly? Nay, He would but have wasted his lessons of wisdom in discoursing with those of no understanding; and they would have neither learned one thing nor the other. And as he who teaches to read before he has taught the alphabet, will never teach even so much as the alphabet; so indeed would it then have been also. But not so now, for by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God much forbearance, much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, has been planted everywhere. Let us give thanks then for all things, and not be over curious. For it is not we that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the due time, but He, The Maker of the time, and The Creator of the ages.</p>
<p>In everything then yield we to Him: for this is to glorify <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, not to demand of Him an account of what He does. In this way too did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; <q>And being fully persuaded,</q> we read, <q>that what He had promised, He was able to perform.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom004.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 4:21</font></u></a></span> He did not ask about the future even; but we scrutinize the account even of the past. See how great folly, how great ingratitude, is here. But let us for the future have done, for no gain comes of it, but much harm even; and let our minds be gratefully disposed towards our Master, and let us send up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that making for all things an offering of thanksgiving, we may be counted worthy of His lovingkindness, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man of His Only-begotten, with whom, etc.</p>

<p>Having said what we have come to, and showed the lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, by the greatness of the things given, he introduces yet another consideration that heightens them, namely, that neither before us did any one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Him. As he does also in the Epistle to the Ephesians, saying, neither Angels, nor principalities, nor any other created power, but only the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph003.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 3:5-10</font></u></a></span> And he said, not simply hid, but <q>quite hid,</q> and that even if it has but now come to pass, yet it is of old, and from the beginning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230305.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> willed these things, and they were so planned out; but why, he says not yet. <q>From the ages,</q> from the beginning, as one might say. And with reason he calls that a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>, which none <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>, save God. And where hid? In Christ; as he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph003.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 3:9</font></u></a></span>, or as when the Prophet says, <q>From everlasting even to everlasting You are.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa089.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 90:2</font></u></a></span> But now has been manifested, he says, <q>to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</q> So that it is altogether of the dispensation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. <q>But now has been manifested,</q> he says.

<p>Let not others therefore deceive you, for they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not. Why to them alone? <q>To whom He was pleased,</q> he says.

Yet His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> is not without reason. By way of making them accountable for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, rather than allowing them to have high thoughts, as though it were of their own achieving, he said, <q>To whom he was pleased to make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>.</q> <q>What is the riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> He has spoken loftily, and accumulated emphasis, seeking, out of his great earnestness, for amplification upon amplification.

They were wont to worship stones and the earth; but they learned that themselves are better both than the heaven and the sun, and that the whole world serves them; they were captives and prisoners of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: on a sudden they are placed above his head, and lay commands on him and scourge him: from being captives and slaves to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, they have become the body of The Master of the Angels and the Archangels; from not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> even what God is, they have become all at once sharers even in God's throne. Would you see the countless steps they overleaped? First, they had to learn that stones are not gods; secondly, that they not only are not gods, but inferior even to men; thirdly, to brutes even; fourthly, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230305.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">plants</font></u></a> even; fifthly, they brought together the extremes: that not only stones but not earth even, nor animals, nor plants, nor man, nor heaven; or, to begin again, that not stones, not animals, not plants, not elements, not things above, not things below, not man, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, not Angels, not Archangels, not any of those Powers above, ought to be worshipped by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of man. Being drawn up, as it were, from some deep, they had to learn that the Lord of all, He is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that Him alone is it right to worship; that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> life is a good thing; that this present death is not death, nor this life, life; that the body is raised, that it becomes incorruptible, that it will ascend into heaven, that it obtains even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>, that it stands with Angels, that it is removed there. But Him who was there below, having cleared at a bound all these steps, He has placed on high upon the throne, having made Him that was lower than the stones, higher in dominion than the Angels, and the Archangels, and the thrones, and the dominions. Truly <q>What is the riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>?</q> Just as if one should show a fool to be all at once made a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a>; yea rather, whatsoever one should say, it would be as nothing: for even the words of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> are undefined. <q>What is the riches,</q> he says, <q>of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, which is Christ in you?</q> Again, they had to learn that He who is above, and who rules Angels and dominions, and all the other Powers, came down below, and was made Man, and suffered countless things, and rose again, and was received up.</p>
<p>All these things were of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>; and he sets them down together with lofty praise, saying, <q>Which is Christ in you?</q> But if He be in you, why seek ye Angels? <q>Of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>.</q> For there are other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> besides. But this is really a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>, which no one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>, which is marvelous, which is beside the common expectation, which was hid. <q>Which is Christ in you,</q> he says, <q>the hope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, whom we proclaim,</q> bringing Him from above. <q>Whom we,</q> not Angels: <q>teaching</q> and <q>admonishing</q>: not imperiously nor using constraint, for this too is of God's lovingkindness to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, not to bring them to Him after the manner of a tyrant. Seeing it was a great thing he had said, <q>teaching,</q> he added, <q>admonishing,</q> which is rather like a father than an instructor. <q>Whom,</q> says he, <q>we proclaim, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom.</q> So that all wisdom is needed. That is, saying all things in wisdom. For the ability to learn such things exists not in every one. <q>That we may present every man perfect in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>.</q> What do you say, <q>every man</q>? Yea; this is what we are earnestly desirous of doing, he says. For what, if this do not come to pass? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a> endeavored. <q>Perfect.</q> This then is perfection, the other is imperfect: so that if one have not even the whole of wisdom, he is imperfect. <q>Perfect in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>,</q> not in the Law, nor in Angels, for that is not perfection. <q>In Christ,</q> that is, in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. For he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> what Christ has done, will have higher thoughts than to be satisfied with Angels.</p>
<p><q>In Christ Jesus</q>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Ver. 29</font></u></a><font size="4">.</font> <q>Whereunto I labor also, striving.</q> And he said not, <q>I am desirous</q> merely, nor in any indifferent way, but <q>I labor, striving,</q> with great earnestness, with much watching. If I, for your good, thus watch, much more ought ye. Then again, showing that it is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, he says, <q>according to His working which works in me mightily.</q> He shows that this is the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He, now, that makes me strong for this, evidently wills it. Wherefore also when beginning he says, <q>Through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:1</font></u></a></span> So that it is not only out of modesty he so expresses himself, but insisting on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> of the Word as well. <q>And striving.</q> In saying this, he shows that many are fighting against him. Then great is his tender affection. </p></div>

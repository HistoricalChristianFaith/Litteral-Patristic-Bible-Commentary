Mr. Meritt ignores the context of many of the passages that he has given, though there are <u>some</u>
 legitimate arguements that can be cleared up when looked at a little 
deeper. But I have gone through these meticulously and have concluded 
that there are no contradictions, and I have found answers that satisfy 
my expectations, otherwise if I would had run onto any of these that 
appeared to be a contradiction, I would have admitted my failure to find
 an answer. But with God's grace I was not left with that option.<br /><br /><b>Note: </b>Throughout
 these suggested contradictions I have found that the translation that 
Jim Meritt quotes has errors in it, like many versions of <div><a href="http://litteralchristianlibrary.wetpaint.com/page/Answers+to+the+so-called+%22Bible+contradictions%22#" rel="nofollow">the Bible</a>
 do. One reason is because many Bible translations have unfortunately 
relied upon a Hebrew text of the Old Testament called the Masoretic 
Text, which is full of textual errors, and is inferior to other Old 
Testament versions such as the Greek Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls, Latin
 Vulgate, and Aramaic Peshitta. With many of those suggested 
contradictions where the Masoretic Text was used, I have been able to 
show that the Greek Septuagint did not have those errors. The Greek 
Septuagint is a much better and more ancient version of the Old 
Testament, and it was the Old Testament used by the Apostles.<br /><br />Also,
 there are occasions when I was not interested in providing answers for 
certain suggested contradictions because they were more scientific than 
theological, which I am more bent on theology than science, but I gave a
 link to the answers provided by James Patrick Holding, and he answered 
with excellent scientific evidence as well as with humor. <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/merrit01.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="HERE"><font color="#0000ff">HERE</font></a> is a link to Mr. Holding's answers to most of the suggested contradictions of Jim Meritt. <br /><br /><font color="#ff0000" size="7">__________________________________</font><br /><h3> <br /><br /><a name="good_to_all">God good to all, or just a few?</a></h3><b>PSA 145:9 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</b> <br /><br /><b>JER
 13:14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and 
the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have 
mercy, but destroy them.</b><br /><br />The Lord is good to all because He 
gives everyone a free-will and does not force anyone to be good or bad. 
But there are consequences for our actions. Kind of like living in a 
free country; we have the freedom to choose how we live our lives, but 
there are still the laws of the land, and if those laws are broken there
 is punishment for the crimes. <br /><br />In the Jeremiah passage above, the context of the whole passage is a <b><u>warning</u></b>
 to Judah and the house of Israel, not a final sentence, God is giving 
them many chances to repent in the hopes that they will, yet another 
display of God's patience and mercy!<br /><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="war_or_peace"><b>War or Peace?</b></a></h3><b>EXO 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</b> <br /><br /><b>ROM 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</b><br /><br /><br />The
 Lord is a God of peace, but He is a conqueror over evil as well. 
Sometimes war is a necessary evil for the lives and freedom of innocent 
people. But looking at the context, the Greek Septuagint translators 
gives us an idea of the sense of Ex. 15:3, instead of "man of war" they 
translated it as "He shatters wars." <br /><br />Just like a soldier of honor who has peace as the ultimate goal, God crushes evil to bring peace to His people. <br /><br /><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="father_of_joseph"><b>Who is the father of Joseph?</b></a></h3><b>MAT 1:16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was <a href="http://litteralchristianlibrary.wetpaint.com/page/Answers+to+the+so-called+%22Bible+contradictions%22#" rel="nofollow">born Jesus</a>, who is called Christ.</b> <br /><br /><b>LUK
 3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as
 was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli. <font color="#ff0000">(Duoay-Rheims reads "was of Heli")</font></b><br /><br /><br />St.
 Matthew traces Christ’s descent through His father Joseph, St. Luke 
through His mother, the Blessed Virgin; both lines are united in David. 
Jacob was the father of Joseph, but Heli, which is also the name for 
Joachim (<i><u><b>Eli</b></u>achim</i>-<i>Jeho-achim</i>), was the 
father-in-law of Joseph, not the father. In the translation above it 
reads "the son of Heli," but "son" is not in the original Greek text, it
 has a genitive article (<a href="http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3588.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="ho (ho) -- the"><font color="#0000ff">του</font></a>)
 called "genitive of relationship," which can be translated as "son of" 
but not always and it is not required. Some translators, not all, have 
added "son" due to the rest of Luke's geneology has the same thing and 
assuming that "son of Heli" fits the context, but I beg to differ. The “<i>who</i>”
 used by Luke may refer to Joseph, thus—Joseph was the son-in-law of 
Heli/Joachim, because he married his daughter, the Blessed Virgin. And 
again the pronoun “who” may in the Greek clearly be taken with 
“Jesus”—Jesus was the son, <i>i.e</i>., the grandson of Heli/Joachim, 
because He was his offspring, as from a grandfather, through the Blessed
 Virgin. For having premised that Joseph was not the real, but only the 
supposed, father of Christ, there was no reason why St. Luke should 
immediately subjoin the genealogy of Joseph. But rather St. Luke, as 
well as St. Matthew, means to describe the descent of the Blessed Virgin
 and Christ according to the flesh, and this is the end and aim of each 
genealogy—so says S. Augustine <font size="1">(<i>Quæst. veteris et novi Testament, </i>bk. i. q. lvi., and bk. ii. q. vi)</font>. <br /><br /><br /><font size="1">References to <font color="#000000">CORNELIUS À LAPIDE</font> commentary on the Gospel of Luke</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="empty_tomb"><b>Who was at the Empty Tomb?

 28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first 
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the 
sepulchre.</b> <br /><br /><b>MAR 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary
 Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet 
spices, that they might come and anoint him.</b><br /><br /><b>JOH 20:1 The 
first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark,
 unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</b><br /><br /><br />Just
 because St. John only mentions Mary Magdalene does not mean that the 
others were not with her, St. John chose only to mention her name. If 
St. John would have specifically said that Mary Magdalene was all by 
herself, then we would have a contradiction. As St. Augustine says: Mary
 Magdalene, undoubtedly the most fervent in love, of all the women that 
ministered to our Lord; so that John deservedly mentions her only, and

 you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the 
Father: for my Father is greater than I.</b><br /><br /><br />One should understand <b>the Father is greater than I</b>, based on the meaning of <b>I go to the Father</b>.
 Now the Son does not go to the Father insofar as he is the Son of God, 
for as the Son of God he was with the Father from eternity: "<i>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God</i>" <font size="1">(John1:1)</font>. Rather, he is said to go to the Father because of his human nature. Thus when he says, <b>the Father is greater than I</b>,
 he does not mean I, as Son of God, but as Son of man, for in this way 
he is not only inferior to the Father and the Holy Spirit, but even to 
the angels: "<i>We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels</i>" <font size="1">[Heb 2:9]</font>. Again, in some things he was subject to human beings, as his parents <font size="1">(Lk 2:51)</font>. Consequently, he is inferior to the Father because of his human nature, but equal because of his divine nature: "<i>He did not think it robbery to be equal to God, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant</i>" <font size="1">[Phil 2:6]</font>. <br /><br /><font size="1">References from St. Thomas Aquinas Commentary on the Gospel of John</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="beasts_or_man"><b>Which first--beasts or man?</b></a></h3><b>GEN

created first, Gen. 2:4-25 is just a narrative of the creation account, 
not to be taken chronologically. After speaking about the Sabbath rest, 
and how God had blessed and sanctified it, Moses returns to the 
narrative of the initial establishment of creation, and passing over, 
with only a few words, things it had already spoken of and recounting at
 greater length matters it had previously omitted. <br /><br /><font size="1">References to Ephraim the Syrian Commentary on Genesis</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="beasts_in_ark"><b>The number of beasts in the ark</b></a></h3><b>GEN

that God says, "by sevens" does not mean that He wants a double seven in
 each of the different species to be brought aboard, but only seven, or 3
 pairs, from which the one that was left over from the pairs could be 
offered to God after the flood. He says "by sevens" on account of the 
many kinds of animals that were to be included in this number. As for 
the phrase in verse 7:9 "two and two", it simply means they all entered 
in the ark two at a time.

 Unfortunately the translation above is a translation from the Hebrew

it is not very old compared to other ancient witnesses, even tough it is
 in Hebrew. There are many errors found in the Masoretic Text that are 
not found in better ancient witnesses such as the Greek Septuagint, 
Aramaic Peshitta, Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Latin Vulgate.<br /><br />The 
Greek Septuagint was the Old Testament of the Apostles, and it was 
translated from a very ancient Hebrew and Aramaic text a couple of 
centuries before Christ came, and in it these passages above have no 
contradictions....<br /><br /><b>1Kings 4:26 And Solomon had forty-thousand <u>horses (ιπποι)</u> for chariots...</b><br /><br /><b>2Chron. 9:25 And Solomon had four-thousand <u>female (θηλειαι)</u> horses for for chariots...</b><br /><br />As
 you can see there are no contradictions at all; 1 Kings recorded the

 thing that Jim Meritt fails to do is to consider the context, 
especially in 1 Cor. 1:19. Because it should be noted that men, however 
evil, are not altogether deprived of God’s gifts; neither are God’s 
gifts in them destroyed. Consequently, he does not say absolutely, “I 
will destroy the wisdom,” because “<i>all wisdom is from the Lord God</i>” <font size="1">(Sir 1:1)</font>,
 but I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, which the wise of this world
 have invented for themselves against the true wisdom of God, because as
 it says in Jas (3:15): “<i>This is not wisdom, descending from above; but earthly, sensual, devilish</i>.” <br /><br /><font size="1">References to St. Thomas Aquinas Commentary on 1 Cor.</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="impregnation"><b>Human vs. ghostly impregnation</b></a></h3><b>ACT

Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary 
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with 
child of the Holy Ghost.</b><br /><br />This one is over the top! In the 
Acts 2:30 passage, with little effort one will see that it is referring 
to David (verse 29), in which Jesus is a descendant. According to Jim 
Meritt's foolish suggestion, Mary would have had to have gotten pregnant
 by David who lived a 1000 years before Jesus was conceived. <br /><br />Ancient
 tradition tells us that Mary was from the line of David, that is, 
evidence from the NT apocrypha as well as some of the Early Church 
Fathers.

Deuteronomy is an exposition of the Old Law that was for the Israelites.
 The passage in Isaiah is in a totally different context. The reference 
in Isaiah to the plural<b> fathers</b> in the phrase <b>because of the guilt of their fathers</b>
 shows that it is the ending of a series of oppressive rulers that is in
 mind. Collectively they represent Babylon itself, and the assassination
 of the sons is made into a picture of the permanent ending of this

 I give Jim some credit, because in today's time we have classifications
 for all the different species, but 3600 years ago when Moses wrote 
Leviticus, the Hebrew word `owph, which is translated above as "bird," 
would be considered to be any winged creature, even a winged insect. In 
Deuteronomy another Hebrew word is used "tsippowr" which has a <u>slightly</u>
 different sense than `owph, but unless we want to blame Moses of an 
error for not looking a few millenniums down the road to the Linnean 
classification then we have no contradiction here.<br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="rabbits"><b>Rabbits do not chew their cud</b></a></h3><b>LEV 11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</b> <br /><b>"Gerah,"
 the term which appears in the MT means (chewed) cud, and also perhaps 
grain, or berry (also a 20th of a sheckel, but I think that we can agree
 that that is irrelevant here). It does *not* mean dung, and there is a 
perfectly adequate Hebrew word for that, which could have been used. 
Furthermore, the phrase translated "chew the cud" in the KJV is more 
exactly "bring up the cud." Rabbits do not bring up anything; they let 
it go all the way through, then eat it again. The description given in 
Leviticus is inaccurate, and that's that. Rabbits do eat their own dung;
 they do not bring anything up and chew on it.</b><br /><br /><br />This is answered very eloquently by James Patrick Holding <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/af/cudchewers.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="HERE"><font color="#0000ff">HERE</font></a><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="insects"><b>Insects do NOT have four feet</b></a></h3><b>LEV

 58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like

 which many scholars believe it means snail (though they are uncertain);
 but the Greek Septuagint and the Aramaic Peshitta</font><font face="Trebuchet MS"> both read "wax," 
which fits the context much better. Either the Masoretic Text has a 
scribal error or the Septuagint and Peshitta translators understood 
Shabluwl to actually mean wax and not snail. So the error that Jim 
Meritt claims is not an error of God's Word, though it could very well 
be an error of the Masoretic Text, which would not surprise me.</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="fowl"><b>Fowl from waters or ground?</b></a></h3><b>GEN

 for the "days," "evenings," and "mornings" before the sun was created, 
it does not have to be the sun in order for there to be light to exist 
before the sun was created, God is more than capable to provide light

cloud which accompanied the Israelites, Exodus 14:19, or the three first

days. Nothing can be defined with certainty respecting the nature of 
this primeval light."<br /><br />As for the use of Elohim and it being a 
plural noun, Jim Meritt must not have known enough Hebrew (if any) to 
know that the use of the singular verbs around Elohim suggests that it 
was to be understood as being One, but that One having something plural

for the His creation of the human race and God's satisfaction, why not? 
Sure God knew that they would sin, but He was still satisfied with them 
and loved them. Like any good parent who has children, they are proud of
 them despite their faults and shortcomings they have throughout their 
lives. In fact God with His foreknowledge knows what the final outcome

out that everything turns out just fine.<br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="moses"><b>Moses' personality</b></a></h3><b>NUM 12:3: "Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the fact of the earth."</b> <br /><br /><b>NUM

not get angry. In fact I have found that those who are meek, soft 
spoken, and gentle are the ones that you don't want to push so far to 
anger, because once someone like that has reached their limit then look

 two places in the New Testament the genealogy of Jesus son of Mary is 
mentioned. MAT 1:6-16 and LUK 3:23-31. Each gives the ancestors of 
Joseph the CLAIMED husband of Mary and Step father of Jesus. The first 
one starts from Abraham(verse 2) all the way down to Jesus. The second 
one from Jesus all the way back to Adam. The only common name to these 
two lists between David and Jesus is JOSEPH, How can this be true? and 
also How can Jesus have a genealogy when all Muslims and most Christians
 believe that Jesus had/has no father.</b> <br /><br />In the time of 
Christ it was very well known that Mathan was the common grandfather of 
Joseph and the Blessed Virgin; and that Jacob, the father of Joseph, and
 Heli/Joachim, the father of the Blessed Virgin, were full brothers - as
 Francis Lucas holds - or rather, that Jacob was the brother of St. 
Anne, the wife of Heli/Joachim, and mother of the Blessed Virgin; hence 
the genealogy of one is the genealogy of the other. For the Blessed 
Virgin was descended, through her mother, from Jacob, Mathan, and 
Solomon, and, through her father, Joachim/Heli, from Mathat and Nathan. <br />So
 St. Matthew gives the genealogy of the Blessed Virgin through her 
mother St. Anne, while St. Luke gives it through her father 
Heli/Joachim, so that Christ may be shown to be descended of the seed of
 David in both ways. <br />There is no other better way than this of 
reconciling the genealogies given by St. Matthew and St. Luke. Moreover,
 it is the common opinion of St. Augustine, Denis the Carthusian, 
Cajetan, Jansenius, and other doctors whom Suarez quotes (pt. iii., 
quæst. xxvii. a. 1, disp. 3, sect. 2) that St. Luke traces the genealogy
 of Christ through Heli/Joachim, the father of the Blessed Virgin. Hence
 it must follow that St. Matthew’s genealogy is traced through St. Anne,
 and that she was the daughter of Mathan; for otherwise all her 
ancestors, whom St. Matthew recounts, belong only to Joseph, and not to 
the Blessed Virgin and Christ. <br />St. Matthew then traces Christ’s 
descent through His father Joseph, St. Luke through His mother, the 
Blessed Virgin; both lines are united in David, but after him separate 
through his two sons Solomon and Nathan. And again these two lines of 
Nathan and of Solomon unite in St. Anne, the daughter of Mathan, and 
sister of Jacob, Joseph’s father. <br /><br /><font size="1">References to <font color="#000000">CORNELIUS À LAPIDE</font> commentary on the Gospel of Luke</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="god_seen"><b>God be seen?</b></a></h3><b>EXO 24:9,10; AMO 9:1; GEN 26:2; and JOH 14:9   <br /><br /><u>God CAN be seen:</u><br />"And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my backparts."

(JOH 1:18)</b><b> <br />"And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me and live." (EXO 33:20)<br />"Whom no man hath seen nor can see." (1TIM 6:16)</b><br /><br />Moses
 saw not the essence of God, but only a certain luminous substance 
assumed by an angel, in some manner representing to the eyes of Moses 
the glory of God. Thus St. Gregory says in the <i>Catena</i>: “So long 
as we live here in mortal flesh, God may be seen by certain 
manifestations or images of Him, but as He is in His own nature He 
cannot be seen.”<br /><br />To understand it we must know that God is said 
to be seen in three ways. First, through a created substitute presented 
to the bodily sight; as Abraham is believed to have seen God when he saw
 three [men] and adored one (Gn 18). He adored one because he recognized
 the mystery of the Trinity in the three, whom he first thought to be 
men, and later believed to be angels. In a second way, through a 
representation in the imagination; and in this way Isaiah saw the Lord 
seated on a high and lofty throne. Many visions of this sort are 
recorded in the Scriptures. In a third way, he is seen through an 
intelligible species abstracted from material things; and in this way he
 is seen by those who, considering the greatness of creatures, see with 
their intellect the greatness of the Creator, as it is said: “From the 
greatness and beauty of creatures, their Creator can be seen 
accordingly” (Wis 13:5); “The invisible things of God are clearly seen, 
being understood through the things that are made,” as found in Romans 
(1:20). In another way, God is seen through a certain spiritual light 
infused by God into spiritual minds during contemplation; and this is 
the way Jacob saw God face to face, as it says in Genesis (32:30). 
According to Gregory, this vision came about through his lofty 
contemplation.<br /><br />But the vision of the divine essence is not 
attained by any of the above visions: for no created species, whether it
 be that by which an external sense is informed, or by which the 
imagination is informed, or by which the intellect is informed, is 
representative of the divine essence as it is. Now man knows as to its 
essence only what the species he has in his intellect represents as it 
is. Therefore, the vision of the divine essence is not attained through 
any species.<br /><br />The reason why no created species can represent the 
divine essence is plain: for nothing finite can represent the infinite 
as it is; but every created species is finite; therefore [it cannot 
represent the infinite as it is]. Further, God is his own <i>esse; </i>and
 therefore his wisdom and greatness and anything else are the same. But 
all those cannot be represented through one created thing. Therefore, 
the knowledge by which God is seen through creatures is not a knowledge 
of his essence, but a knowledge that is dark and mirrored, and from 
afar. <br /><br /><font size="1">References to St. Thomas Aquinas and CORNELIUS À LAPIDE commentaries on the Gospel of John</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="cruel"><b>CRUEL, UNMERCIFUL, DESTRUCTIVE, and FEROCIOUS or KIND, MERCIFUL, and GOOD:</b></a></h3><b>"I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy."

reflects itself in their actions, whereas “he who commits sin is of the 
devil” (v.8), for sin cuts one off from God and means one has submitted 
to the slavery of the Devil.<br /><br /><font size="1">References to the Navarre Bible I John</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><br /><h3> <a name="potter_field"><b>Who bought potter's field</b></a></h3><b>ACT

 take the Gospel passages to mean that since Jesus had already described
 the end of the world, then the passage is saying "this generation" is 
stretched to mean the entire age of Jesus until His 2nd coming. But that
 is not what it means. This passage is answered in the Greek word <font color="#000000">γένηται</font><font color="#000000">,
 which is an indefinite aorist. Being an ingressive aorist we can 
understand it to have a nuance that would make the passage to be 
understood like this, “I tell you the truth, this generation will 
certainly not pass away until all these things <i>begin</i> to come to pass (</font><font color="#000000">γένηται</font><font color="#000000">).”</font><br /><br /><font color="#000000">This
 nuance of the same aorist form may also be seen in the angel Gabriel’s 
words to Zechariah (Luke 1:20): “And now you will be silent and not able
 to speak until the day these things happen (</font><font color="#000000">γένηται</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#000000">ταῦτα</font><font color="#000000">)."</font>
 Not only the birth but the adult ministry of John the Baptist is 
prophesied in vv. 13-17, yet Zechariah recovers his speech as soon as he
 writes the name of his infant son John on a tablet (vv. 62-64). 
Accordingly, v. 20 should be understood as, “And now you will be silent 
and not able to speak until the day these things <i>begin</i> to happen.”<br /><br /><font size="1">References to the Basics to Bible Greek by William Mounce</font><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="overseers"><b>Solomon's overseers</b></a></h3><b>1KI 9:23 550   <br />2CH 8:10 250</b><br /><br />I

 the fact that the numbers given in both the Ezra and Nehemiah census 
don’t add up to the total of 42,360 is a clue, that the “numbers given” 
aren’t the ENTIRE congregation! The numbers in the census of both books 
are only the amount of MEN that returned to Judah (see Neh 7:7 and Ezra 
2:2) while the total of 42,360 includes the whole congregation (Neh 
7:66, Ezra 2:64). There is no error in addition. The rebuilding of the 
city would attract many more men than women, and especially single men 
who didn’t have livelihoods back in Babylon. Many of the men that 
returned to Judah married non-Jewish wives (see Neh 13:23 and Ezra 9:2).
 </font><font color="#000000">On the second point, Nehemiah’s census 
gives different numbers to Ezra’s census for over 20 clans, which rules 
out the possibility of the whole thing being an unintentional mistake 
(keep in mind Nehemiah was written after Ezra). Clearly when Nehemiah 
found the census (see Neh 7:5), which he proceeds to copy out through 
the rest of ch7, the records had been changed since the time that Ezra 
made his original census (the one of Ezra 2). Not only are many numbers 
different in Nehemiah’s census but also the order of the families listed
 is different. So Nehemiah merely copied out faithfully the census that 
he found in Neh 7:5. The only thing left to speculate is why there were 
differences between that census and Ezra’s census. There are many 
explanations for the changes. The most plausible answer is that the 
census that Nehemiah found in Neh 7:5 was an update to Ezra’s first 
census (which may have been merely a count of all the people that left 
or planned to leave Babylon for Israel, made in Babylon). The update was
 made in Israel after a recount (carried out after Ezra’s arrival in 
Israel) of all the men that had actually arrived in Israel from Babylon.
 More men from various families came after Ezra’s first census was made,
 and not everyone on Ezra’s first census made it to Israel or had died 
by the time the update was made. Despite the other changes, the total of
 42,360 was kept in the census that Nehemiah found, which may be because
 the 42,360 of Ezra 2:64 actually took into account the updates already 
(while the numbers of the separate families didn’t) or otherwise the 
updater of the census decided to leave the figure of 42,360 because only
 the total number of men had been recounted and updated and as we have 
said the TOTAL included women.</font> <font size="1">References found </font><a href="http://www.biblebc.com/Ask_A_Question/7questions/Names_Ages_Dates_Numbers.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="HERE"><font color="#0000ff" size="1">HERE</font></a><br /><font size="7">_________________________________</font><br /><br /><h3> <a name="robe"><b>What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?</b></a></h3><b>MAT 27:28 scarlet</b> <br /><b>JOH 19:2 purple</b><br /><br />There

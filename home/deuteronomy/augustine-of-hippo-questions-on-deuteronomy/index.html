1,29-30).</strong> The words that Moses says to the people, afraid of the enemies that
live in the country where he is going to take them, and which are these: Do not
be afraid or fear them; the Lord your God, who goes before you, he will conquer
you at your side, they clearly show that God helps man, but men must act also.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

2,30).</strong> But Seón, king of Esebón, did not want to let us pass through there,
because the Lord our God had hardened his spirit and obstinately his heart to
deliver it into your hands as it happens today. Moses, in saying these words
while speaking to the people, remembers something similar to what was said in
the Exodus: I have hardened Pharaoh's heart (Ex 10,1). And it is read in the
psalms. Change their hearts so that they hate their people (Ps. 104,25). The
cause of this hardening is not hidden here, because it is said: To deliver it
into your hands as it happens today; This means, so you beat him. And this
would not happen if the person did not resist, and the person would not resist
if he did not have a hardened heart. If we investigate the justice of this
fact, we would have to say that the judgments of God are inscrutable (Cf Rm
11,33). But in God there is no iniquity4. For the rest, it must be noted that
it can be said that the heart is obstinate even in evil.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

refaím in the Hebrew language means "giants", according to those who
know it. Therefore, what most codices say was abandoned by the refaim, is
expressed more clearly saying that it was the last remaining, that is, was one
of the survivors of those giants. And that is why the length and width of his
iron bed is also mentioned, to make his height more clearly visible.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

4,16).</strong> Do not commit an iniquity, making for yourselves a sculpted likeness,
any image. Often wonder what difference there is between similarity and image.
But here I do not see what difference there may be between them, unless the
same thing is indicated by those two words or it is called resemblance to a
statue or simulacrum that has the human figure, but without expressing the
human features, as painters do or sculptors when they contemplate those who
paint or sculpt. No one would hesitate to say that this is an image. According
to this distinction, every image is also similarity, but not all similarity is
also image. Therefore, if the twins are similar to each other, the similarity
of any one in another can be called similarity, not image. And if the son is
similar to the father, it is correctly said that it is also his image, so that
the father is the prototype of where that expressed image appears. As for the
images, some are of the same substance, as the son. Others do not, like
painting. Therefore, the words of Genesis: God made man in the image of God, (Gn
1, 27) does not mean naturally that the image was made out of the same divine
substance. Because if it were of the same substance, then it would not be said
that it was made, but that it was generated. But the fact that it has not been
added: and similarity, when in Genesis it was said: Let us make man in our
image and likeness, (Gn 1,26) has given rise to some to affirm that the
similarity is something more than the image, which would be reserved later to
reform man by the grace of Christ. It strikes me, if you have not wanted to
remember only the image afterwards, precisely because where there is an image,
there is automatically a resemblance there too. Hence it follows that Moses
here also prohibits similarities and images from being made, perhaps for the
reason we have said.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In the
Decalogue, however, it is said in a general way that no resemblance should be
made (Cf Ex 20,4), but the image is not mentioned. Naturally, when no
resemblance is made, it is evident that no image is made either, because if an
image is made, a similarity is also made. On the other hand, if a similarity is
made, it does not necessarily make an image. Now, if there is no similarity, it
follows that there is no image. Finally, when resemblance and image were
forbidden, the text wanted to refer to that of man, where a resemblance can be
made, not of this one or of that one, but of any man, and an image of this or
that man. . When referring, on the other hand, to cattle and irrational
animals, only similarity has been mentioned (Cf Dt 4,17). Because what animal

from one end of the sky to the other, and it is not said: "from one end of
the earth to the other." A similar expression also appears in the Gospel,
when the Lord says that the elect will be gathered from one end of the heavens
to the other (Mt 24,31). Perhaps it is wanted to say here that neither the men
nor the angels never heard say what God has done of singularísimo with this
town. For the text goes on saying: If something as great as this has been done;
if something similar has been heard. If any people have heard the voice of the
living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard it and have
survived (Dt 4,33). And if the thing is like that, that is, that God says that
neither men nor angels have heard anything similar, what do those words of the

enter the promised land -for all died- do not belong to this alliance, whose
recognition was then made when they were counted from twenty years old up to
fifty years old as people capable of war? (Cf Nm 1,20) And how Did the Lord
speak to those who live today? Perhaps because those from twenty years down,
who could well remember this, could be many then, free from that punishment
that God established for those who were counted then, telling them that they
would not enter the promised land and says this to those who even though they
were not twenty years old or up, when God spoke to them on the mountain, in
order to be counted then, however, they could have been from nineteen years old
down to childhood, so that they could see, hear and retain in memory the things

do these words mean: Face to face the Lord spoke to you, who says to those who
a short time before he tried to admonish them seriously, warning them that they
had not seen any image, but had only heard a voice coming from the midst of the
fire? perhaps of those words for the evidence of things and for the presence in
some way of the manifestation of divinity, of which no one could doubt? And if
this is so, what problem is there in understanding this very thing about Moses,
when about him it is said that the Lord spoke with him face to face, (Cf Ex
33,11) so that even he would not see with his eyes out of the fire? Or is it
necessary to think that he saw something else, since it is said that he entered
the fog or the cloud where God was? (Cf Ex 24,18) But even if he had seen
something other than what they saw, it can not be deduced that he would have
seen the substance of God with his mortal eyes, of the words he addressed to
God, saying: If I have found grace before you, show yourself to me, so that I
may see you clearly. For the rest, we should not think that this people, to
whom Moses spoke, would have seen God face to face, when he spoke on the
mountain from the midst of the fire, as the Apostle says that we will see him
in the hereafter, with these words: Now we see in a mirror, confusedly; then we
will see face to face. He then says what it is and how much it is: Now I know
imperfectly; but then I will know how I am known (1Co 13,12). But this same
thing must be taken with caution, so that man does not think that he will have
as much knowledge of God as God does now of man, but that, according to his
capacity, he will have such perfect knowledge that he will not have to wait
that nothing more is added to it. Because with the same perfection with which
God now knows man and does it as God with respect to man, so man will know God
perfectly and will do as man with God. And although it has been said: Be
perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect, (Mt 5,58) not for that reason
should we expect equality with the Father who has the Only Begotten Word. In
spite of everything, there have been those who have thought that this will
happen too, unless we misunderstand what they say.</font></span><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

announce to you the words of the Lord? Is it that the Lord was somewhere, that
is, on the mountain, from where they heard the voices? This should not be taken
in the sense that by this text we should think that the substance of God is in
some bodily place, because God is all everywhere, without approaching or moving
away by local distances. The manifestations of God do not show themselves in
any other way to the human senses in that creature that is not him. Therefore,
the Lord, wanting to turn our minds away from the suspicions by which God is
thought to be contained in a place, says: There will come a time when neither
on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what
you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation comes from the
Jews. But there comes a time and it is this, in which the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeks those who adore
him in this way. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth (Jn 4,21-24). Moses, therefore, said that he was an
intermediary, not between the substance of God and the people by a local
distance, but because the people preferred to hear through him the remaining
words of God, after having been terrified to hear, coming from the midst of the
fire, the voice of the Lord that promulgated the Decalogue (Cf Ex 20,19).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But with
all reason we can investigate the meaning of these words of Moses collected by
Deuteronomy: And I was then between the Lord and you to announce to you the
words of the Lord, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up to the
mountain, saying: I am the Lord your God (Dt 5,5.6), etc. These are already
words of the Lord contained in the Decalogue. What, then, means the addition:
saying? If we thought that there is hyperbaton and that the order of words
would be: And I was then between the Lord and you to announce to you the words
of the Lord, saying: "I am the Lord your God", then this is not true.
For the people did not hear these words through Moses, but he heard them from
the midst of the fire. The town could not stand this. When he heard the
Decalogue, he asked for the rest to be told by Moses. In short, the word:
saying, means as if it had been said: when it said. And the meaning would be: I
was then between the Lord and you to announce to you the words of the Lord,
because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up to the mountain, when he
said: "I am the Lord your God." It is understood: «when the Lord
said». When the Lord said these words mentioned below, taking them from the
Decalogue, the people were afraid before the fire and did not go up the
mountain, and prayed that the Lord would speak to them rather through Moses (Cf
20,18.19).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Moses
recalls in Deuteronomy that the people said those words to him, because he did
not want to hear the voice of the Lord anymore, but they asked God to speak to
them through Moses, saying: Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and
we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire (Dt 5,24), etc. In the
Exodus it does not say exactly the same when the things that are repeated here
are counted for the first time (Cf Ex 20,22). But as we have already recalled
some other times, we should not think that we should attribute to a lie the fact
that the same decision is expressed by any other words, and this in attention
also to the own words of the evangelists, that the ignorant and Slanderers
claim that they contradict each other. For Moses, in fact, it was not difficult
to attend to what he had written in the Exodus and to repeat it with the same
words, if it were not for our holy doctors to suggest this to the disciples,
telling them not to seek, in the words of the who speak, nothing other than the
intention with which the words have been put to indicate it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

5,29).</strong> What does it mean what Moses says the Lord told him about the Hebrew
people with these words: Who will make his heart so be that they fear me and
keep my commandments !? Does the Lord intend to say that we must understand
here that this favor is granted by his grace, namely, that the justice of God
be in men by faith, not as their own as if it came from the law? (Cf Philip 3,9)
This idea it is indicated by the text of the prophet, when the Lord says: I
will take away the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh (Ez 11,19;
36,26). And this is said according to the meaning of the word meat and that
does not have the word stone, because this word is used in a metaphorical
sense. The prophet says this in another place: Behold, the days are coming,
says the Lord, when I will conclude a new covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah; not like the covenant I made with his parents the day
I took his hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Because this will be
the covenant I made with them: After those days I will put my laws in his heart
and write them on his mind, and I will no longer remember his iniquities or his
sins (Jr 38 (31), 31.32.33.34). Here distinguishes the new alliance from the
old one, because in the old one the law was given on stone tablets; in the new,
however, it occurred in hearts, which is done by grace. That is why the Apostle
also says: Not on tablets of stone, but on the tables of flesh of the heart.
And in another place he says: He made us qualified ministers for the new
covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (2Co 3,3.6).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

is used: The Lord your God is testing you to know if you love him (Dt 13,3). It
is already understood that the author puts "to know" as the
equivalent of "to make it known." And this very thing is said here
with all clarity: To prove to you and make known what is in your heart. It does

perish in the desert, because they did not know how to distinguish between the
right and the left. But now it is said of them that they are stiff-necked.
Therefore, we must see that these words contain a mystery, not that the merits
of these men are extolled. And so, so that nobody thinks that these have become
suddenly blameworthy, when shortly before they praised his merits, they are
told a little later: Remember; do not forget how much you provoked the Lord
your God in the wilderness: From the day you left the land of Egypt until you
came to this place, you continued to be unbelieving about the Lord. If some of
them were unbelievers, and others faithful and good, neither is the promised
land granted to those who can not distinguish between the right and the left,
so that we understand it in the sense that they have not offended God. Because
their parents, who died, and who were not allowed to enter that land, it is
seen that they were also like these, and so also among them there were some
good ones. That is why the Apostle says that not all, but some of them,
committed sins and mentions those sins (Cf 1Co 10,6-9). This text of Deuteronomy
also teaches with total evidence that they were similar to their parents. Then
add: And in the Horeb you provoked the Lord. From which it follows that he was
certainly irritated by those who were not allowed to enter the promised land
because of their own bad deeds.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

with the two tables in my hands. And he wrote on the tablets the same as he had

out of the midst of the fire. And the Lord gave them to me. We can rightly ask
why Moses collects and repeats in Deuteronomy in a different way facts that,
when they are narrated in the Exodus as said and realized for the first time,
are described as follows: And the Lord said to Moses: "Write these words ;
for according to these words I established this alliance with you and with
Israel. " And Moses was there before the Lord forty days and forty nights;
He did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of
the covenant, the ten commandments. Well, if in the Exodus it is said that
Moses himself wrote on the tablets the ten commandments of the Law, how is it
said here, in Deuteronomy, that God wrote those same commandments on the
tablets?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

when I incidentally discussed what is said in the Exodus and when I put in
writing what I thought about that difference, I said the reason why it is said
that the first tablets broken by Moses were written by the finger of God and ,
on the other hand, the second ones, which were to remain so long in the ark and
in the tabernacle, are said to have been written by Moses. I also said there
that by this difference the two Testaments had been meaning; in the Old the law
is presented as the work of God, in which man did not intervene at all, since
the law could not be fulfilled by fear, since when the law is really fulfilled,
it is fulfilled by love, not through fear, and this love is the grace of the
New Testament (Cf Rm 13,10). Therefore, when speaking of the second tables, it
is said that man wrote the words of God, since man can perform the work of the
law for the love of justice, which he can not do because of the fear of God.
pain.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Well, when
we speak in Deuteronomy of the second tablets, the following is said: And I
carved two tables of stone like the first and climbed the mountain with the two
tablets in my hand. And he wrote on the tablets the same as he had written
before, the ten words (Dt 10,3.4) does not say, "and I wrote," but
wrote and wrote, that is, God, as he had just said the words that God had
addressed to him: there will be two tables of stone like the first ones and go
up where I am on the mountain, and you will make an ark of wood. And I will
write in the tables the words that were in the first tables (Dt 10,1.2). The
question arises, therefore, that it is necessary to discuss, that here it is
read that it was God, and not man, who wrote the two tables the first and the
second. Now, if in the Exodus the words with which God sends Moses that other
tablets are made are read, nothing else is found except that God himself
promised that he would write them. The text reads as follows: And the Lord said
to Moses, "Make two tables of stone like the first, and go up to where I
am on the mountain. And I will write on the tablets the words that were in the
first tables, which you broke” (Ex 34,1). Therefore outside of Deuteronomy,
only the Exodus also deals with this question about the way God ordered: And I
will write on the tablets the words that were in the first tables. For a little
later it is said: Write these words; for according to these words I established
this alliance with you and with Israel. And Moses was there before the Lord
forty days and forty nights; He did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote
on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments (Ex 34,27.28).
Because if what was said before: Write these words; for according to these
words I established with you and with Israel this covenant, it belongs to the
above, when God commanded these things, that they would not be written on the
two tablets of stone, but in that book of the law in which many things are
written, then what follows: And Moses was there before the Lord forty days and
forty nights; He did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the
words of the covenant, the ten commandments, it shows clearly that Moses was
the one who wrote these ten commandments on the tablets and not God. Unless,
when it says: And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten
commandments, we are forced to understand in a violent way, but driven by a
certain need, that it was not Moses who did it, but the Lord -because it is
said before: And Moses was there in the presence of the Lord. in this way we
would have to accept that these ten commandments were written on the tablets by
the Lord, as he had promised before, in whose presence Moses was forty days and
forty nights without eating bread or drinking water.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And if
this is so, then in no way can these words imply that difference between the
two Testaments, which seemed to me reflected there, since the same as the first
tablets would have written them, not man, but God . But that difference offers
no doubt, because the first tablets were not only made by God, but also by God.
And on that occasion it was not said to Moses: Wash two tablets, but the text
says: Moses turned and came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the
covenant in his hands; stone tablets, written by both parties; they were
written by one and the other side; and the tablets were the work of God, and
the writing engraved on the tablets was the writing of God (Ex 32,15.16). It
had been said before that these tablets had been written by the finger of God.
The text reads as follows: And as soon as he stopped speaking to Moses on Mount
Sinai, he immediately gave him the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of
stone written by the finger of God (Ex 31,18). There, not only were the tablets
the work of God, but the writing of the tablets had been drawn by the finger of
God. On the other hand, as regards the second tables, Moses is ordered to work
them himself. Thus it is naturally understood that they were carved by the hand
of man, although God has written them, as he promised when he ordered them to
be worked. But if we pay a little more attention, we see that with respect to
the second tables both were said, because not only God performs by his grace
the work of the law in man, but man, receiving by grace the grace of God, who
belongs to the New Testament, is a cooperator of God who gives his help-that is
why, in the first tables only the work of God is mentioned, since the law is
spiritual and the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and fair and good (Rm
7,12). But no man's work is mentioned there, since the infidels do not moderate
themselves with the help of grace, but, ignoring the justice of God and wanting
to establish their own, they did not submit to the justice of God (Rm 10,3).
That is why the law serves as a condemnation, and that is what the breaking of
tables means. Obviously, we are not obliged to understand, violating the
intellection of the text, which God wrote, when the Scripture says that Moses
was there in the presence of the Lord forty days and forty nights; He did not
eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant
(Ex 34,28). In this text it is clearly heard that Moses wrote. But God promised
to write previously, and in Deuteronomy it is narrated that not only he
promised, but he did it, to signify what the Apostle says: For God is the one
who works in us not only to will, but also to act according to his place (Philip
2,13). Acts in those who through faith receive grace and do not seek to
establish their justice, but are subject to the justice of God, so that they
themselves are the righteousness of God in Christ. The Apostle, in that text,
says both: that God works and that they work. For if they did not work, how
could it be said to them: with fear and trembling work out your own salvation? (Flp
2,12) So, God works; we cooperate; for it does not make the decision of good
will disappear, but helps.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

you a sign or a miracle, and that sign or miracle is made to you, saying,
"Let us go and serve other gods, which you do not know," you will
hear the words of that prophet or of that seer of dreams, for the Lord your God
is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart

you love, but: so that you know (ut sciat) if you love. Although the meaning of
the phrase seems the same, however, the expression: to know (scire) refers more
easily to the Israelites. So the phrase: I try to know, is equivalent to:
"testing you makes you know." And here, of course, the Lord wanted
them to understand also those things that the fortune-tellers say, that they do
not agree with God if what they say happens. And these things do not have to be
taken as if what they command or venerate the things they revere. And God does
not say that the fact that these things happen is beyond his power. It exposes
rather, as if it were asked why it allows them, that the motive of the test is
to know the love that they have and if that love is a love to their God. And,
of course, it is they who must know if they love him, and not God, because God

After three years you will separate all the tithes of your fruits; in that year
you will put this in your cities; and the Levite shall come, because he has no
part nor inheritance with you, and the stranger and the fatherless and the
widow who are in your cities and shall eat and be satisfied, so that the Lord
your God may bless you in all the works you do. It does not say that he eats
with his own from this tithe. And that is why he commands that it be given to
the Levites and the strangers, and to the orphans and the widows. But the
subject is not clearly expressed, since this tithe is not distinguished from
that which was ordered to be eaten with the Levites in the place that the Lord
chose for his temple. In the translation made directly from Hebrew we find this
expressed more clearly. The text says: In the third year you will separate
another tithe from all the things that are born in that time, and you will put
it inside your doors. And then the Levite, who has no other part or possession
with you, and the stranger, and the orphan and the widow, who are inside your
gates, will come and eat and be satisfied, so that the Lord your God may bless
in all works of your hands that you make. In the first place, what is said at
the beginning is clearer: In the third year. This means that there is an
intermediate year between one and the other. On the other hand, in the Seventy,
it is said: After three years. And for that, it is not known if they mean that
there must be three intermediate years, so that will be done every five years.
In addition, when the text says: And you will separate another tithe, it
already shows clearly that it is not the tithe that should eat the same that
offers it with theirs and with the Levites in the place that the Lord has chosen.
With regard to this other tithe, it has been ordered to put it inside the doors
themselves, and not to take it to that place where the Lord wanted to be
invoked. It says: And the Levite will come, who has no other part or possession
with you, and the stranger and the orphan and the widow, who are inside your
gates and will eat it. From this it is clear that God did not want this tithe
to be common, for the one who offers it and for those to whom it is given, but
ordered that it be given only to those who did not have anything else, among
whom is mentioned mainly the Levite After seven years you will remission (Dt
15,1). Here it appears clearly why before it was also said: After three years.
Indeed, the Lord also did not want these seven years to be intermediate. He
ordered to pay the tithe every year, as if it were the observation of a Sabbath
of years.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

15,19).</strong> Every firstborn born in your cows or your sheep, if you are male, you
will consecrate it to the Lord your God. It is necessary to investigate if
those who in Greek are called protótoka and in Latin can only be called
"firstborn" (firstborn) are only those born of mothers, since these
creatures properly are rather delivered than not generated. In fact, giving
birth corresponds in Greek to tíktein, which is an act of the female -where
protothokon is derived-; engendering, on the other hand, corresponds to gennan,
so in Latin it is properly called "firstborn." Well, of the females
the first ones were born, that is to say, the creatures that were born the
first ones, not those that were engendered the first by the husbands, in the
case that they were engendered of widowed women, who had already given birth .
Because otherwise it would not be these creatures that would open the maternal
womb, a fact on which the law of those who were born first and who were to be
consecrated to the Lord is properly based. Now, if in these words there is a
certain distinction, then it is not said in vain that the Lord is not
monotonous; (only born) of the Father, but monogenés -ie, only begotten,
because he is unique-; but in Latin it is certainly said to be the firstborn
among the dead, (Col 1,18) because the Latin word can not be composed in that
way, according to our way of speaking; in Greek, on the other hand, it is said
prototokos (first born) and not protogenic (first begotten), as if the Father
had begotten one equal to himself, and, on the other hand, the creature would
have given birth to him. The text that says: Firstborn of all creation (Col
1,15), where the Greek word protótokos also appears, can be understood
according to the new creation, about which the Apostle says: If, then, it is in
Christ a new creation (2Co 5,17). Christ is the first of this creation, because
the first rose not to die again, and so that death does not dominate again (Cf
Rm 6,9), something that is promised to be so at last for the new creation that
takes place in it. But this distinction can not be stated recklessly, but must
be investigated more diligently in the Scriptures. Because it draws attention
how it could be said in the Proverbs: Firstborn, I tell you, son (Pv 24,70 31,2),
that is, of what person is meant to be said. If it refers to Christ as said by
the person of God the Father - and it is difficult to affirm that what follows
fits this interpretation - then the Scripture calls the firstborn who is also
only begotten: firstborn, because we are also children of God (Cf 1 Jn 3,2);
only begotten, because he alone is of the substance of the Father, equal to the
Father and eternal like him. But it is something that draws attention to know
if the Scripture distinguishes with clear arguments between giving birth and
giving birth.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

dealing with the immolation of the Passover, we only spoke about sheep that had

referring to Christ, whose carnal origin comes from the righteous and sinners.
The text does not say: of sheep or goats, although it could not be understood
in the sheep's own sense of the goats. But so that the Jews would not say that
perhaps it would be necessary to understand a goat, if it had been said:
"or of the goats", that is why it was said: of the sheep and the

precept, since he did not have a single woman (Cf 2R 5,13). Solomon clearly
transgressed this precept, not only as regards women, but as regards silver and
gold. But from here it follows rather that the kings were allowed to have more
than one woman. They were forbidden to have many. This prohibition was not
transgressed if a king had few women, as was the case of David. But you should
not have many, like Solomon. When the text adds: so that his heart does not go
astray, it seems rather to mean that he should not have a large number, so that
he does not have foreign women, which, in the case of Solomon, made his heart
turn away of God (Cf 1R 11,1-6). But a large number of women were forbidden in
a general way, so that, even if it were a large number of Hebrew women, it could
reasonably be said that the king in this case would have acted contrary to this

God, it is necessary to investigate how these wonders, whose search is
forbidden, can be distinguished from those that have divine origin and are
given in a way that their meaning must be indicated. Thus, for example, all the
miracles found in the Scriptures and mean something relative to the rule of
faith. In this way we explain, for example, the meaning of the dry fleece, the

they will not enter the assembly of the Lord even to the tenth generation or
ever. The problem lies in how Ruth entered, who was a Moabite (Cf Rt 1,22),
from whom the Lord even proceeds by natural means (Cf Mt 1,5). Perhaps it is
necessary to understand that mystically prophesied that it would enter, in
saying the text: until the tenth generation. Because the generations are
counted from Abraham, when Lot also lived, who fathered the Moabites and the
Ammonites of their own daughters (Cf Gn 19,37.38), and it is discovered that,
counting Abraham himself, there are ten generations until Solomon, who fathered
Boaz, husband second of Ruth. The generations are these: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
Judah, Phares, Esrom, Aram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon. Salmon fathered Boaz (Cf
1Cro 1.2), who married Ruth, who was a widow. That is why it is seen that after
the tenth generation he left offspring in the Lord's assembly, giving Boaz
children. But we can still ask with reason why it is added: never. Is it
because after the prophecy was fulfilled with this tenth generation did not any
other person of the Ammonites and Moabites enter the assembly of the Hebrew
people? Or were these words rather said: not until the tenth generation, to
mean, through a certain universality of the number ten, that they would never
enter, in such a way that the author came to say this same, adding the
following words: not ever? And if this is true, then it seems that Ruth was
admitted against this prohibition. Or was it forbidden to admit the Ammonites
and not the Ammonites, that is, men and not women? This solution would be
understood above all because, when the Israelites defeated those people, they
were ordered to kill all the males and not the women, except those who had had
sexual relations with the men, (Cf Nm 31,17.18) since these women had dragged
the people to fornication. But they wanted to spare the lives of the virgins,
not imputing to them the guilt for which those people deserved defeat. And
these people are also remembered here, as if they were wondering why the Lord
would not have wanted to admit the Moabites and the Ammonites into the assembly
of the Lord. To explain it, it is added: Because they did not come to meet you
with bread and water when you were on the way out of Egypt, and because they
brought Balaam, the son of Beor, of Mesopotamia, to curse you (Dt 23,4). These
guilt, even then, when that town was defeated, they were imputed to the women,
whom they preferred to keep alive.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

will be no man prostituted among the children of Israel. This is the text in
which it is expressly prohibited to fornicate, not only men, but women, even
with their own spouses, demonstrating that it is a sin to mix with people other
than the spouses themselves, since it is prohibited to have prostitutes and
approach those whose sexuality is publicly sold. In the Decalogue it seems that
this was not explicitly prohibited under the name of moechia, because under
this name only adultery is usually understood. Therefore, I have already stated
in that passage what I thought about this topic.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

of the Lord your God in relation to any vow, because both are abominable to the
Lord your God. This must be understood in the sense that it is an abomination
to the Lord your God not one of these things, but both. In relation to the dog,
it is forbidden to make the change of the firstborn, which he orders to be made
with the other impure animals, such as horses and donkeys and other similar
ones, which serve as a help to man, and in Latin receive the name of iumenta (
jumentos), because it is derived from iuvando (help). In relation to the dog,
he has not allowed it. It is necessary to investigate if it has not allowed it
with respect to the pig and why, and if it has not been allowed regarding these
animals why in this passage only the dog has been excepted. The reason for
mentioning the reward of the prostitute seems to be because before it was
forbidden that there were prostitutes among the children of Israel and it was forbidden
for anyone of them to approach one of them (Cf Dt 23,17). And so that no one
would think that this sin could be expiated by offering in the temple something
of the obtained for that sin, it had to be said that it was an abomination to
the Lord.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

wicked from among you. The Scripture repeats this many times when it commands
to kill the wicked. The Apostle used an expression like this, saying: Why do I
have to judge the outsiders? Is it not to those within who you judge? Cast out
the wicked one among you. Greek has ton put, a term that also appears here. But
this word is usually translated as "malignant" rather than
"bad." And the text does not say: to put, that is, the bad; but ton
put, that is, the evil one. From this it follows that he wanted to refer to the
one who does something for which he is worthy of excommunication. In effect,
the excommunication now makes in the Church what then did the death penalty. In
spite of everything, that saying of the Apostle could also be understood in
another way, that is, in the sense that each one will receive the order to cast
out of himself the evil or the evil one. This sense would be more acceptable,
if the evil or evil, and not the evil one, was found in Greek. Now, it is more
credible that this has been said of man than vice. Although it could also be
understood very well in the sense that man should remove the bad man from
himself, according to that text which says: You undress the old man. And to
explain who it is, he adds: He who stole, who no longer steals (Ef 4,22.28).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

pledge to give it to the creditor. With respect to the mandate to return the
pledge to the homeless on the same day, so that he can sleep on it who does not
have anywhere to sleep, it is worth noting that the creditor has not been sent
to take the pledge that must be returned. the same day. And if this has been
preferred to do so to force the debtor, how are you urged to return a piece of

the parents: each one will die in his sin. This is not only what the prophets
have said (Cf Ez 18,18-20). The law itself says that each one will perish
through his fault, not that of his father or that of his son. What does it mean
what is said in another place: God who punishes the sins of the parents in the
children until the third and fourth generation? (Ex 20,5) Is that understood
perhaps from the unborn children because of original sin, that the gender Is
human also dragged from Adam, and here, on the other hand, has the distinction
of the already born children been made, so that each one dies for his sin?
Well, it draws nothing from the father who was already born when his father
sinned. But when it is also said there: to those who hate me, it is clear that
that condition can also be changed, if the children had not imitated the
actions of their parents. For even what comes from Adam is temporarily imputed,
because everyone dies for it, but eternally imputed to those who have been
regenerated spiritually by grace and have remained in it until the end. But if
the sins of the parents in the children are imputed to those who hate God, it
could also be asked with all reason why they are imputed until the third and
fourth generation, leaving aside the first and second, or why not they impute
also to the other generations, if the impiety and the imitation of the bad
parents remain. Or did you want to indicate the totality with this number,
because the seven is understood and the number seven itself has not been put to
say: "until the seventh generation", and thus the totality would be
understood, since in this way it was indicated more Well the cause of the
perfection of this number? This number is considered perfect precisely because
it consists of these two, that is, number three, odd in its entirety, and
number four, even in its entirety. I think that this prophetic oracle is also
derived from here, which is repeated many times: by the three, by the four
iniquities, I will not throw myself back (Am 1,3). With this phrase it has been

widow. You will not take the widow's dress as a pledge. Why do not you say: And
you will not take their clothes as a pledge? What is the reason why it has been
forbidden to twist the judgment of these three and, on the other hand, have
only been forbidden to take the garment of the widow as a pledge, and not that
of the others? The reason why it is recommended to make the judgments of all is
because they have no one to defend them, nor the stranger, because he is in a
foreign land, nor the orphan, that is, the pupil, because he has no parents,
nor the widow, because He has no husband. On the other hand, when it is
forbidden to wear the widow's dress as a pledge, I think that she warns
elegantly that only those who are poor should be called truly widows. To this
the Apostle also clearly alludes, when he says: But if a widow has children or
grandchildren, let her first learn to practice the duties of piety with those
of her own house and to correspond with her parents; because this is pleasing
to the Lord. But the one who is truly a widow and is desolate, has placed her
hope in the Lord and perseveres in her prayers night and day (1Tm 5,4.5). She
calls the widow truly the one who does not support her, because she is deprived
not only of her husband, but of descendants and of all help. Of course I would
not call a desolate woman rich. The poor one does not have to take off the
dress he has in pledge; because the law states that he is poor because he
forbids his dress to be taken away from him. For the creditor would rather
remove the money or anything else from the dress. But if one thought to think:
if she had many unnecessary dresses, but superfluous, how is it understood that
she is a true widow, that is, not only desolate, but also alien to a life in
the midst of delights? About this widow the Apostle adds: The one who lives in
the midst of delights, even when living, is dead (1Tm 5,6). And this widow
opposes her to the real widow, and says that she is not a true widow. In
wealthy widows, who have not remarried, continence is praised, its desolation
is not proclaimed. For these widows are only deprived of a husband, not of
other things.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

left for the poor, it is presented Maybe the interrogation, and what should be
done if what the owners of the fields leave is not picked up by the poor, but
by the bad ones? In the first place, it is necessary to consider that the work
moved by an act of mercy abandons those things with the intention that it is
for the poor what it abandons. Secondly, when these things are sent to the
people, at the same time those who do not need it are recommended not to look
for those abandoned things. And if they seek them, what should we think they do
but take control of things from others, and, what is even more serious, of the
things of the poor? With these precepts alludes to two categories of people: to
the owners of the fields, so that they leave those things mercifully; to those
who are not poor, so that they refrain from collecting them. Both things are
said in the text: that is, who should leave them, and for whom they should be
left.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

goes on: And they will take it away from the wicked, and it will come to pass
that, if he is worthy of stripes, who has done wrong, you will put him before
the judges and scourge him according to his impiety. He will be flogged with
forty lashes, no more. But if they continue to whip you with many more lashes,
your brother will be debased before you. You have to pay attention. Although
the Scripture has commanded to punish with scouring the sins that do not
deserve to be punished with the death penalty and with so few, nevertheless the
one who is scourged called him impious or worker of impiety, so that we know that
the Scriptures do not speak as they do Many. We read the Scriptures with little
attention, if we think that adultery is not an impiety, because it seems that
whoever has committed it has sinned against man, while the law orders that sin
be punished with the death penalty (Cf Dt 22,22) and we say that impiety they
are more serious than these sins, because some of them belong to those who are
punished with only forty lashes. So, there is a slight impiety worthy of the
scourge, and there is another serious impiety that deserves the death penalty.
In the same way, the sins that seem to be directed, not against God, but
against man, some are worthy of the death penalty, and others, of a correction,
which can be by whipping or by an easier forgiveness. It is evident that the
Seventy have said the same thing, since they, too, have called impiety the sin
of him who is worthy of the punishment of flogging.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

25,5-6).</strong> From the law on Levirate. "If two brothers live together, and one
of them die without children; the wife of the dead will not be to another who
is not near to him; her husband's brother will go to her, take her for a wife,
and live with her. And the child who will be born will be admitted in the name
of the deceased, and his name will not be erased from Israel. In wanting the
widow to be married by her husband's brother, the Law seems to have had no
other purpose than to raise a posterity to the one who died without children.
Now, these words: "The child shall be admitted in the name of the
deceased, and his name," that of the deceased, "shall not be removed
from Israel," appear to mean that by taking the name borne by the
deceased, the child will in a way form his posterity. Also, in the question
raised by the Gospel, about the two fathers of St. Joseph, one of whom, quoted
by St. Matthew, begot Joseph, and whose other, named by St. Luke, had Joseph as
son, we have admitted adoption as the most plausible solution of this apparent
contradiction (Accord des Evang. liv II, c. 3; Matt.I, 16; Luc, III, 23); since
St. Joseph did not name either of them. But perhaps these words: "He will
be admitted" in the name of the deceased, "do not they mean that he
will take his name, but that he will be established by this heir, that is to
say, as a son, not of him who begat him, but of the dead, to whom were raised
children. Indeed, these expressions: "And his name will not be
erased" from Israel, "may mean, not that the child will be required
to bear the name of the deceased, but that the latter will seem not to be dead
without posterity and that his name, that is to say, his memory will thus be
saved from oblivion. Without a doubt,. if he had had a son himself, he would
not have needed to give him his name, to render him imperishable in Israel; but
by this alone that he would not have died without posterity, his name would not
have perished: now, which was not in his power, the Law commands him to his
brother, ordering him to marry the widow of the deceased. For the rest, in the
absence of the brother, the nearest relative married the woman of the dead
Israelite without children, in order to raise him a posterity: this is how Booz
married Ruth, in order to raise children to a close relative, she had been the
wife, without having children from him; the son who was born of her was
admitted in the name of the deceased, since his son was called; and thus the
memory of the deceased did not perish in Israel, though the child did not bear
his name.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

The two genealogies of Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. - If this is true, then we
have a second way of resolving the objection from the Gospel: one of the two
fathers of St. Joseph, named by St. Matthew and St. Luke, would have been close
relative of the another, whose widow he married, to such a degree that both
could have ascendants and different ancestors. Indeed, if they had been
children of two brothers, they would have had only one common ancestor; which
is not: for according to Matthew, Mathan is Joseph's grandfather; and according
to Luke, it is not Nathan, but Mathath. What if, by reason of the similarity of
the names, we claim to see here a mistake of copyist, too small and too futile
for it to be taken into account, what will be said about the names of their
fathers? In fact, according to St. Luke, Mathath was the son of Levi; According
to Matthew, Mathan had Eleazar as his father; and thus, going back, the names
of the fathers and grandfathers vary; then the names of the ancestors to
Zerubbabel, which is, according to St. Luke, almost the twentieth ancestor of
Joseph, and according to St. Matthew, the eleventh only. What leads us to
believe that there is here one and the same personage, quoted by the two
Gospels, is cheerful, the one and the other lai give to father Salathiel; but
it may happen that two persons bear the same name, and that their fathers are
in the same case. In ascending above, indeed, the names differ again as follows
St. Luke, Zerubbabel is grandson of Neri; following St. Matthew, of Jechonias.
This diversity continues until we reach David, passing through Solomon, in
Matthew, and in Luke, by Nathan. Now, it is very difficult to admit that, in
order to marry the widow of a brother, there was no closer relative than the
one who was descended from David in a degree so remote and had no contact with
him. dead husband other related; since David, in St. Luke, is almost the
fortieth ancestor of Joseph, and in St. Matthew, about the twenty-seventh. However,
if relatives on the women's side were called to marry the widows of their
brethren, it could have been that a relative on this side would have begotten
Joseph from his union with the wife of his near relative who died without
children; in this way, Joseph would have had a natural father and a legal
father, which would explain the absence of kinship in fathers, ancestors and
ancestors, because kinship would come from the side of women and not from men.
But in this hypothesis, David would not be the only father of Joseph. If it is
claimed that this hypothesis is not unacceptable, have we not noticed somewhere
that Scripture does not have the custom of placing women in the genealogies
instead of men, as well as can we see it by the Evangelists? There, indeed,
where we find the names of the mothers, it is never except by the name of the fathers
(II Rétr. c. 55, n. 3). As a result, one must go back to David to establish
kinship, in default of a next of kin who married the wife of the deceased,
where the adoption gave Joseph a second father.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

going to the right or to the left behind other gods to serve them. It may be
asked how it could be interpreted that it goes to the right who goes after
other gods to serve them, when the right is praised, and, on the other hand,
the worship of the gods could never be considered worthy of it? Although those
who lean to the right are also reprimanded in the path of life, however, in
this text they do not criticize the things that are on the right, but those who
lean to the right, that is, the one who arrogate what is of God. That is why it
is said in the Proverbs: Do not deviate to the right or to the left, because
the paths to the right are known by the Lord; however, those on the left are
perverse. Therefore, the right that the Lord knows is good, for the Lord knows
the ways of the just, (Ps. 1,6) as the psalm reads. The reason why it is said
do not deviate to the right, it is explained with what is added next: For he
will make your ways straight. God forbid I deny that the right hand known by
the Lord is not right, but, as I said, to turn towards it is not to bow to the
grace of God, but to want to attribute to oneself what is right. Finally, as I
said, he adds and says: He himself will make your paths straight and all your
travels will carry them forward in peace (Pv 4,27).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
what is said in this place of Deuteronomy that we are dealing with: You will
not turn away from any commandment that I give you today to go to the right or
to the left after other gods to serve them, it has not been said because the
gods others can also be taken as the right; but they have meant earthly places,
because the Gentiles who worshiped other gods had them on the right and on the
left; or this must be read separately from the other gods, so that the phrase
has two senses, one of which would be this: You will not depart from any
commandment that I give you today to the right or to the left, understood
naturally according to what I explained above. Another meaning would be: Going
after other gods to serve them, so that you also understand here: You will not
turn away from any commandment that I give you today. If we wanted to express
all this sense, we should repeat the previous terms, which are common to both
directions, so that, as it is said: You will not turn away from any commandment
that I give you today to the right or to the left, as well also repeat here:
You will not turn away from any commandment that I give you today by going
after other gods to serve them. Leaving aside, then, the commandments that God
has given, this is also done: to go after other gods. Because he did not send
only this, or God does not want to be overlooked only that which he ordered:
that no one go after other gods, but wants everything that he commanded to be
fulfilled. But this he did so prominently that, after the universality of the
precept, in which it was noticed that no one should depart from any word of his
commandments, he also wanted to send this separately.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

following words: To the right or to the left, can be understood as well: that
has not been commanded to go after other gods or because of what is desired,
because of happiness, or because of what it shies away, to cause of
unhappiness, that is, neither for what is loved nor against what is abhorred,
you can ask for the help of other gods, nor in a way that either they are
reconciled to lend their help or that they are placated so that they do not
cause harm, for on some the following was also written in the psalm: The mouth
of these said lying and their right is right of iniquity, precisely because it
is believed that they make the man happy these things, which can have not only
the good, if not bad, and that's why the right is proper to iniquity, because
those who consider this is the right are wicked, when it is not the true right,
but is the right of those whose mouth tells lies; they called happy the people
who possess these things, when in reality, as soon as it is added and said: The
people whose God is the Lord is blessed (Sal 143,8.15). This is the true right
of justice, not of iniquity. One should not go, then, behind other gods or to
the right, so that man believes that he receives happiness from them, nor to
the left, so that, believing that if they are contrary to him, he will be an
unhappy man, adore them for turn away misery. Or at least, if we think that the
right is the eternal goods and the left the temporary goods, it must not be
believed that the Sacred Scripture allows in this place to worship other gods
or for those goods or for these.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

age, and your skins were not broken by your feet. You did not eat bread; you
did not drink wine or fermented drink, so that you would know that this is the
Lord your God. From this it follows that the Israelites were able to carry in
their impediment, when they left Egypt, the amount of wine they could consume
immediately, because if they had not taken anything with them, where would that
come from what has been said: The people sat down to eat and they got up to
play? (Ex 32,6) Because this could not be said of the water, when the clear

29,18-20).</strong> Is there among you man or woman, or family or tribe whose mind has
departed from the Lord your God going to serve the gods of those people? Is
there a root among you that grows in gall and bitterness? And it will happen
that when someone hears the words of this curse and says in his heart, saying:
"Holy things happen to me, because I walk in the error of my heart so that
the sinner does not lose at the same time the one who is without sin", God
He will not forgive him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealousy against
that man will be kindled, and all the curses of this covenant that are written
in the book of this law will fall on him. The text reads as follows: Is there
anyone among you? You have to understand it, then, in the form of a question,
in case there is one. If there had been, it filled him with terror, so that no
one would say in his heart, upon hearing those curses: Be holy to me (curses be
holy things to me), for I walk in the error of my heart, that is, I wish these
things do not happen to me; that bad things do not happen to me, but holy
things, that is, auspicious and favorable, because I walk in the error of my
heart, following the gods of the Gentiles and giving them worship as with
impunity. It will not be like that, therefore. That the sinner does not lose
the one who is without sin at the same time. It means: make sure that no one of
you convinces you to do these things who thinks them. God will not forgive him,
both the one who thinks such things, and the one who has been persuaded by
them, just as the other had thought when he said: Be holy to me, as if removing
the force of that curse in this way. But then the wrath of the Lord and his
jealousy will be kindled against that man, when he thinks that he will turn it
away from himself, by saying those things in his heart. And all the curses of
this covenant, which are written in the book of this law, will fall on him. All
of them can not come on one man, because a man can not die so many times how
many genera of deaths are announced here. The text says "all" by
"any", so that he will not be free from all those to whom any of the
curses that cause him to perish come to him. The words: So that the sinner does
not lose at the same time the one who is without sin, it is not necessary to
take them in the sense that the Greek word antarcton designates an absolutely
clean and pure one of all sin, but the term anamárteton, literally « without
sin ", refers to one who would be free from the sin that was being talked
about. As when the Lord says in the Gospel: If I had not come and spoken to
you, you would not have sin (Jn 15,22), where you do not mean that you would
not have any sin, but that you would not have this sin if you did not believe
in it. God also says to Abimelek, referring to Sarah, the wife of Abraham: I
know that you did it with a clean heart. It is evident that the Lord did not
mean to say that the heart of Abimelek was as clean as those of whom it is said:
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Abimelek had his heart
clean of that sin that was involved, because, as far as he had depended, he had
not wanted the other woman's.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

30,11-14).</strong> Because this precept that I am sending you today is not out of
measure or far from you. He is not in heaven, saying-that is, for you to say-
"Who will come up to heaven for us and bring it to us and hear it?"
Nor is it on the other side of the sea, saying-that is, for You say: "Who
will go for us across the sea and bring it to us and listen to it and put it to
work?" This word is very close to you. It is in your mouth and in your
heart and in your hands so that you put it to work. The Apostle says that this
is the word of faith, belonging to the New Testament (Cf Rm 10,8). But we can
ask why previously they are called commandments to the things that are written
in the book of this law (Cf Dt 29,21). And the explanation is because they all
mean the spiritual things belonging to the New Testament, if they are
understood correctly. We can also ask why what is said here: Nor is it on the
other side of the sea, for you to say: «Who will go for us to the other side of
the sea and bring it to us?, The Apostle picks it up, saying: <span> </span>Who will go down into the abyss? "And, in
explaining these words, he adds: This is: bringing Christ up from the dead (Rm
10,7). The explanation is that the author calls sea to all the life that passes
in this world, and that is crossed with death, so that in a certain way the sea
ends and death is called the other side of the sea, as if was the other side of
this life, which is indicated by the word sea. On the other hand, what the text
says: And in your hands, the Apostle does not collect it, but only says: In
your mouth and in your heart (Rm 10,8). And this he continued until the end,
saying: For with the heart one believes to obtain justice, and with the mouth
confession is made to obtain salvation (Rm 10,10). With good reason, then, the
translated text of the Hebrew, as far as I could verify, does not have the
words: in your hands. But I do not believe that the Seventy have added it
uselessly. They want to say that the hands themselves, which signify the works,
must also be received in the heart, where faith is, that works through love (Gal
5,6). Because if the things that God commands are done externally with the
hands and are not made with the heart, there is no one so foolish that he
thinks that this is how the commandments are fulfilled. For the rest, if love,
which is the fullness of the law (Cf Rm 13,10), dwells in the heart, even
though one can not work with the bodily hands, it naturally has peace with men
of good will (Cf Lc 2,14).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><strong>55 (Dt
32,5).</strong> The vituperable children did not sin for him. What the Greek says: tékna
mometá, some translate it as vituperable children, like the text that I quote;
others for children stained; others for vicious children. From here a serious
problem does not derive; There is no problem at all. But if those words were
said in a general way: They sinned not for him -because the one who sins does
not sin for God, does not harm God, but himself-, then the question of knowing
how to understand what is that is read in the psalm: For you I have only sinned
(Ps. 50,6). And in Jeremiah it is said: We have sinned for you, patience of
Israel, O Lord! And again in a psalm it says: Heal my soul, because I have
sinned for you (Ps. 40,5). And we want to know if it is the same thing to
"sin for God" (peccare Deo) than to "sin against God"
(peccare in Deum). In this respect the priest Eli says: If one sins against
God, who will pray for him? (1R 2,25) Meanwhile, I will say what I think about
the matter now. Maybe those who know these things better, or even myself at
another time, as far as the Lord helps me, will understand a little better.
"To sin against God" (in Deum) is to sin in that which is related to
the divine worship. Because nothing else indicates the example I have just mentioned.
So Eli's sons sinned, to whom his father had already told them this. In the
same way we must think that sin is also committed against men who belong to
God. Because we read that God said these same words to Abimelek about Sarah:
That is why I have prevented you from sinning against me (Gn 20,6). On the
other hand, "to sin for the Lord" (Domino), or rather "to have
sinned for the Lord" - unless there is somewhere a text of Scripture that
opposes this sense - it seems that it can be said, not without reason, of those
who do not make a pious penance of their sins to give glory to God, who
forgives them. David, explaining the reason why he said: For you only I have
sinned and I have done wrong in front of you, add the following words: So that
you may be declared fair in your words and expire when you judge (Ps. 50,6).
And the same when God says: Judge between me and between my vineyard (Is 5,3).
And the same when it is affirmed of our Lord Jesus Christ, the only one who
could say with absolute truth: Because the Prince of this world is coming and
against me he has nothing -no sin that is worthy of death-. But that I may know
the world that I love the Father and that I work according to the command given
me by the Father, rise up; let's get out of here (Jn 14,30.31). By this he
means: Even if the Prince of the world pursues the smallest sins with the death
penalty, he has nothing against me; but, get up; let's go from here, to suffer
the passion, because suffering I fulfill the will of my Father; I do not pay
the guilt of my sin. In relation to what Jeremiah says: We have sinned for you,
patience of Israel, surely this is said in a supplicating way to the Lord in
penance, waiting for salvation through forgiveness. The phrase: Heal my soul,
because I have sinned for you, means the same, that is, that God be glorified
forgiving, because his mercy is great for those who confess to him and turn to
him, because he does not want death of the sinner, but to become and live (Cf
Ez 33,11). He also answered like this, not only in the psalm, but also when God
rebuked him through the prophet, not without the hope of the Lord's
forgiveness: I sinned for the Lord (2R 12,13). For a person who puts himself in
the hands of the doctor to cure him, is wounded to the doctor, so that the
effectiveness of the medicine is fulfilled in it. Well, in this song the
prophet predicted that there would be some who would sin by offending God with
such great iniquities, that they would not be willing to do penance and return
to God to be healed. Of these it is also said in another place: Because they are
flesh; a breath that goes and does not return (Ps.77,39). The phrase: They
sinned not for him, can also be understood in the sense that they did not hurt
God with their sin, but themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><strong>56 (Dt
33,1-5).</strong> And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the
children of Israel before they died. And he said: "The Lord has come from
Sinai, and it has been shown to us from Seir. It has been hurried from Mount Farán
with many thousands of Kadesh. On his right there are angels with him; and he
forgave his people; and all the sanctified ones are under your hands and these
are under you. And he took from his words the law, which Moses commanded us,
inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob. And there will be a prince in the
beloved, once the princes of the peoples gathered together with the tribes of
Israel. " Do not overlook or neglect this prophecy. It is seen that this
blessing refers to the new people, which Christ the Lord sanctified, and from
whose person Moses says these things, not from Moses himself. And all this is
evident from what is said below. If it is said: The Lord has come from Sinai,
because on Mount Sinai the law was given, what does it mean next: And it has
been shown to us from Seir, being that Seir is a mount of Idumea, where Did
Esau reign? On the other hand, since Moses blesses the children of Israel with
these words, as the Scripture predicts, how does Moses say: And he took from
his words the law, which Moses commanded us? It is, without a doubt, a
prophecy, as we have said, that announces in advance a new people sanctified by
the grace of Christ under the name of the children of Israel, because this
people is a descendant of Abraham, that is, they are the children of the
promise. And it means "seeing God." Therefore, in the Lord, who has
come from Sinai, one must see Christ, because Sinai means trial. Christ has
come from the test of passion, of the cross, of death. And it has been shown to
us since Seír. Seír means "hairy," and designates the sinner. That is
how Esau, the abhorred, was born (Cf Gn 25,25). But as those who were sitting
in the darkness and in the shadow of death a light appeared to them (Cf Is 9,2),
that is why it appeared from Seir. At the same time, it is not absurd not to
understand that it was predicted that the grace of Christ would come to the
people of Israel from the Gentiles, meaning by the name of Seir, because it is
a mountain belonging to Esau. That is why the Apostle says: So also they did not
now believe in the mercy granted to you so that they too may obtain mercy (Rm
11,31). They say: It has been shown to us from Seir and it has been hurried
from Mount Farán -from the fruitful mountain, for this means Farán, by which
the Church is designated-, with many thousands from Cades. Cades means
"changed" and "sanctity." So many thousands have been
changed and sanctified by grace. With them Christ came to gather the Israelites
later. Then he goes on saying: On his right there are angels with him. This
does not need explanation. And he forgave his people, granting them the
forgiveness of sins. Then the word returns to that people to say: And all the
sanctified are under your hands and they are under you. They are not
overbearing, and without wanting to establish their own justice. They recognize
the grace to submit to the justice of God (Cf Rm 10,3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Then he
says: And he took the law from his words. Who receives it, of course, is the
people of whom it was said: He forgave his people. He received, then, from his
words the law, which Moses commanded us. His people received the law from his
words, because of his teaching he understood the law that Moses commanded us.
For Christ himself said in the Gospel: If you believed in Moses, you would also
believe in me, for he wrote about me (Jn 5,46). The Jewish people did not
receive a law that they did not understand. He received it when he understood
it from his words without the ancient veil and once he converted the people to
the Lord. He calls this law inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob. And it is
an inheritance, not earthly, but celestial; not temporary, but eternal. And it
continues: And there will be a prince in the beloved. The prince, of course, is
the Lord Jesus, who will be in the beloved town. Once the princes of the
peoples - of the Gentiles - gathered together with the tribes of Israel. And
this is to fulfill what was said before: Rejoice, Gentiles, together with his
people, because a partial blindness has come upon Israel, until all the
Gentiles enter and thus all Israel will be saved.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

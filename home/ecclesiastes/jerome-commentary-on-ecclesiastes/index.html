and studying virtuous Blesilla's book of Ecclesiastes that I taught her to
think lightly of her generation and to esteem futile everything that she saw in
the world.<span>  </span>I remember too being asked by
her to examine individually all the difficult passages in a short treatise so
that she might be able to understand what she was reading without me always
being present.<span>  </span>Accordingly, since she
was taken from us by her sudden death while I was still doing the preparation
for my work, and since we, it seems, dear Paula and Eustochium, did not deserve
to have such a companion in our lives, I then ceased from my work, silenced by
the terrible grief of such a misfortune.<span> 
</span>Now though, situated in Bethlehem, clearly a more holy city, I can
fulfil that promise to the memory of Blesilla and to you, and remind you
briefly that I have used no authority in this work, but have rather translated
directly from the Hebrew itself and have adapted it to the traditional language
of the Septuagint in those passages which do not differ greatly from the
Hebrew.<span>  </span>Occasionally I have taken
account of the Greek versions, those of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion so
that I do not deter the reader's enthusiasm with too much novelty.<span>  </span>I have also not pursued those streams of
conjecture, which lack a factual basis, for I do not believe this to be
sensible.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Scriptures state very clearly that Solomon was known by three names:<span>  </span>'Peace-making', that is 'Solomon'; 'Yedidia',
that is 'beloved of Yahweh'; and the name used here 'Qoheleth', that is
Ecclesiastes.<span>  </span>He is called Ecclesiastes
in Greek because he gathered together a crowd of people, <i>a congregation</i>, which we can call a demagogue because he spoke to
the people and his sermon was not addressed specifically to one man but more
usually to all men.<span>  </span>Moreover he is
called 'peace-making' and 'beloved of Yahweh' because there was peace during
his reign and the Lord loved him.<span>  </span>For
also Psalms 44, and 71, are known by titles connected with love and
peace-making.<span>  </span>Although these psalms
pertain to Christ and the Church they exhibit Solomon's joy and strength, and
according to tradition were composed concerning Solomon.</span></font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

also produced an equal number of titles to the three volumes: <i>Proverbs</i>, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, and <i>Song of
Songs</i>.<span>  </span>He teaches for children in <i>Proverbs</i> and gives instruction in the
form of maxims almost with a sense of duty, and his sermons here are repeated
continually to his son.<span>  </span>In <i>Ecclesiastes</i> he teaches a man of mature
age that he should not think anything in the world to be perpetual, but that
all things that we perceive are in fact vain and fleeting.<span>  </span>In <i>Song
of Songs</i> he embraces an elderly man in the covenant, who has already been
prepared in spurning his times.<span>  </span>For
unless we first abandon our moral failings and renounce the pomposity of our
world, and prepare ourselves so we are ready for the arrival of Christ, we will
not be able to say:<span>  </span>"let him kiss
me from the kiss of his mouth"</font></font><a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff" size="3">[2]</font></u></span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">.<span>  </span>Philosophers educate their followers in a
manner similar to this type of instruction: first of all they teach ethics,
then explain physics, and then anyone whom they see to excel in these first two
they then go on to teach theology.<span> 
</span>Moreover even this should be examined more closely because Solomon is
named differently in the three books.<span>  </span>In
<i>Proverbs</i> for example he is thus
named: <i>The Proverbs of Solomon, the son
of David, King of Israel.</i></font></font><a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff" size="3">[3]</font></u></span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span>  </span>But in Ecclesiastes: <i>The words of Ecclesiastes, son of David, King of Jerusalem. </i>'Israel'
in fact is unnecessary here because it is not found in the Greek or Latin
manuscripts.<span>  </span>But in <i>Song of Songs</i> he is neither named 'son of David', not 'King of
Israel' or 'King of Jerusalem', but only as <i>The
Song of Songs of Solomon</i>.<span>  </span>This is
just as the Proverbs and the crude arrangement pertain to the twelve tribes and
to the whole of Israel.<span>  </span>And although the
contempt of the world only comes to city-dwellers, these are the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, therefore Solomon intends <i>Song
of Songs</i> particularly for those who desire spiritual enlightenment.<span>  </span>To those readers just embarking on their
education paternal honour and the authority of the king are claimed in their
own merit, but to those who have completed their learning, and in the case
where the disciple has been enlightened not by fear, but by love, his own name
suffices.<span>  </span>Then, he is equal to his
teacher and he is unaware that he is a king.<span> 
</span>This is the case here.<span>  </span>But in a
more spiritual understanding Solomon was peace making and beloved of the Lord
God, and Ecclesiastes can be seen as our Christ too, who destroying the inner
wall and expelling evil from his flesh, makes each of them one, saying -
"I give you my peace, I relinquish my peace to you"</font></font><a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff" size="3">[4]</font></u></span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">,

king.<span>  </span>This is the son of David, to whom
the blind cried out in the Gospel: "pity us, son of David"; and the
whole crowd sang out in unison: "Hosanna to the son of David".<span>  </span>Then there is the fact that the word of God
does not come to him as is the case with Jeremiah and the other prophets, but
on account of his being rich, being a king, holding power, his wisdom and his
other virtues, he speaks to the men of the church himself, and he speaks words
to the apostles about which Psalm 18.5 tells us: "their sound went out to
the whole world and their words went to the ends of the earth".<span>  </span>Some scholars think wrongly, therefore, that
we are tempted into desire and luxury by this book, when it teaches quite to
the contrary: everything we perceive in the world is vain; nor is it fitting
for us to seek those things eagerly which perish while we possess them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

then how can all things be considered vanity, and not only vanity, but even
vanity of vanities?<span>  </span>Just as Song of
Songs means a song that stands out from amongst all songs, so we see that in
"vanity of vanities" the degree of vanity is shown.<span>  </span>It is also written similarly in Psalm 38.6:
"Nevertheless every living man is vanity."<span>  </span>If living man is vanity then a dead man must
be vanity of vanities.<span>  </span>We read in Exodus

this respect, heaven, earth, the seas and all things that are contained within

nothing.<span>  </span>And if I look at the candle in
a lamp and am content with its light, then afterwards when the sun has risen I
cannot discern anymore what was once bright; I will also see the light of the
stars by the light of the setting sun, so in looking at the world and the
multitudinous varieties of nature I am amazed at the greatness of the world,
but I also remember that all things will pass away and the world will grow old,
and that only God is that which has always been.<span>  </span>On account of this realisation I am compelled
to say, not once but twice: <b>Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity.</b><span>  </span>Instead of
"vanity of vanities" the Hebrew text reads 'abal abalim' which all
manuscripts excepting that of the Septuagint translate similarly in Greek as <i>atmos atmidon </i>or<i> atmon </i>which we are able to translate as 'a breath' and 'a light
wind which is quickly dispersed'.<span>  </span>In
this way it is shown to be vain and in no way universal by this phrase.<span>  </span>For those things which seem to be temporal,
in fact are; but those which do not are eternal.<span>  </span>Or since that which will give rise to vanity
has been exposed, he groans and is anxious and awaits the revelation of the

good and wicked) of their own free will.<span> 
</span>And all things under the sun are vain, when we displease each other by
doing what is the greatest good and greatest evil.<span>  </span>A Hebrew, who was instructing me as I read
the Holy Scriptures, said to me that above the word <i>routh</i> was written "<i>it
means rather suffering and wickedness in this place than vexation and will</i>",

to reduce their meanings to just one explanation, so that it is easier to
understand what is being said.<span>  </span>I had all
things that have been considered good through the ages.<span>  </span>I built myself a palace on high, and covered
the hills and mountains with vines.<span>  </span>And
lest anything be lacking from my excess I planted gardens and orchards of
different kinds of trees, which were watered from above by water stored in
pools, so that the growth was fed for longer periods with continual
moisture.<span>  </span>I also had an uncountable
number of slaves, buyers and natives, and many flocks of animals, cows of
course, and sheep- no king before me in Jerusalem had such a number.<span>  </span>I also amassed a huge number of treasure
houses of gold and of silver, which I obtained as gifts from various kings and
as tributes from conquered races.<span>  </span>And
because of this it happened that I was prompted by having too much wealth to
even more pleasures, and they called to me in choirs of music, flutes, lyres
and in songs, and each sex served in entertainment.<span>  </span>Those temptations grew in such quantity as I
was lacking in wisdom.<span>  </span>For desire had
dragged me to each and every pleasure and I was being carried along unbridled
and headlong, and I thought that that was the fruit of my labours, if I myself
was consumed with lust and luxury.<span> 
</span>Having then at last returned to my senses, and as if waking from a deep
sleep, I looked at my hands and saw that my work was full of vanity, full of
squalor, and full of the character of my folly.<span> 
</span>For I found nothing to be good that was considered good in the
world.<span>  </span>Considering therefore those
things which were good for wisdom and which were bad for foolishness I rushed
to praise any man, who then refrained from his sins and was able to pursue true
virtues.<span>  </span>Certainly there is a great
diversity between wisdom and foolishness, and virtues are as much separated
from vices as day differs from night.<span>  </span>It

nothing was more unjust than one man enjoying the work of another, then this
work seemed to me to be the most righteous, and like a gift of God, seeing that
a man may enjoy his own labour, drinking and eating, and for a time refraining
from amassed wealth. And sometimes it is a gift of God, that such a mind as is
bestowed upon righteous men, that they squander those things, which they have
sought with great attention and vigilance.<span> 
</span>In fact on the other hand, it is the character of the anger of God,
which is set against the sinner, so he amasses wealth day and night and uses if
for no purpose, then he bequeaths it to those men who are righteous in the sight
of God.<span>  </span>But, he says, looking at this
more closely and noticing that all things come to a common end with death, I

riches, disdain the poverty of history.<span>

covet his wealth and like a man in flight gather desire prematurely, or to turn
someone else's work to ones own pleasures, and then to think that this is a
gift of God, if we take pleasure in others' discomfort and toil?<span>  </span>It is good though, to take our own food and
drink, which we have found by divine will, from the flesh and blood of a Lamb.<span>  </span>For who is either able to eat or when there
is need to spare in the absence of God?<span>

been found, and only as much as is needed.<span>

beforehand by his own judgement, he will not be worthy of that wisdom,

enlighten for yourselves the light of knowledge."</font><a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[68]</font></u></span></span></a><font face="Times New Roman"><span>  </span>In fact, righteousness ought to be planted
first, and the fruit of life must be reaped, only then, afterwards the light of
knowledge will be able to appear.<span> 
</span>Therefore just as God gave the good man wisdom and other gifts, in the
same way he has forsaken the sinner according to his own judgement, and made
him amass riches and contrive false doctrines therefrom.<span>  </span>When a saintly man who is pleasing to God
sees these things, he understands them, since they are vain and composed of the
conceit of the spirit.<span>  </span>Nor should we
admire what he has said: "he gave vexation to the sinner" and so
on.<span>  </span>For this must be seen in concordance
with that meaning which I have often explained: that for this reason anxiety or
vexation has been given to him, since he was a sinner, and the cause of
vexation was not in God, but in himself, who had sinned previously by his own
volition.<span>  </span></font></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this eloquence, he says, God wanted to be between men and beasts, since we

from beasts in language, though it is shown to us, how we are like the beasts -
weak in body.<span>  </span>Just as a beast dies, thus
man dies, and one breath is for all, and that is the air that we breathe.<span>  </span>For he says this: "and one spirit is for
both, and there is nothing more for man than for beast."<span>  </span>Since lest we think the text refers to the
soul he adds: "all are made from earth and return to the earth."<span>  </span>But nothing else except the body is made from
earth, and quite relevant, regarding the body he continues: "you are earth

if the spirit of the sons of man ascends upwards, or if the spirit of beasts
goes downwards into the earth?<span>  </span>He does
not contend that there is no difference between animals and men in reference to
the dignity of the soul, but in adding "who?" he wants to show the
difficulty of the matter.<span>  </span>For the
pronoun "who" is used in the Holy Scriptures not on account of impossibility,
but a difficulty.<span>  </span>So here it is said in

beast and men, that the spirit of man ascends to the heaven, and the spirit of
the beast descends into the earth and is dispersed with the flesh; but let any
man, who is of the Church and learned in the religious disciplines, be the real
champion of the matter, which is rather doubtful.<span>  </span>Then he adds just how much it refers to a

which we have as "to see what will be after him", Symmachus

neither thief nor robber values, nor any tyrant has the power to take away, and
which follows us after our death.<span>  </span>And we
will not be able to enjoy our toil again when this life will be over, or know
what things will be afterwards in the world.<span> 
</span>Another explanation of this is: I am disturbed by the wickedness of what
I have said above, that I think there is no difference between men and beasts,
and I have been led into this opinion by wrong conclusions, so that I said
nothing else was good, except grasping ones present desire.<span>  </span>Nor when death has destroyed us is it
possible to enjoy these things, which we, ungrateful, leave behind.<span>  </span>Some have referred to that understanding
because it says, "for who leads him, so that he sees those things, which
will be after him", so that they say, "it is better for a man to
enjoy his work" because it is only this that he is able to take away with
him from his possessions.<span>  </span>For when death
comes he will not know what kind of heir he will die with, whether worthy or
unworthy, who will enjoy his wealth.</span></font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

said "let not your mouth cause you not to sin."<span>  </span>But there seems to me however another
meaning, which is argued by those, who complain about the strength of the flesh

provoke God, as if to say He is like the creator of evil and sin, and anger
Him, so that if you seem to have anything good, He will take it from your

meaning of this passage is, since I have said and admonished, "you should
not let your mouth bring guilt on your flesh", and to seek this or that
excuse; I introduce this now, since in the dream of that life, and in the
appearance, shade, cloud in which we live, we are able to find many things,
which seem true to life to us and excuse our sins.<span>  </span>Therefore I advise that you beware that
alone, lest you think God is absent, but fear Him, and know He is present in

messenger that it was a madness, lest God become angry over your speech",
and regarding the remaining things, he had spoken against those, who do not
know that providence rules over human affairs.<span> 
</span>Since therefore the question arises many times about the precept, why
the righteous sustain disaster, and why the unjust become judges over all the
world, but God is not vengeful: now he introduces and finishes this argument,
saying, 'if you see the calamity of a pauper, who is said to be blessed in the
Gospel, and the situation is assessed according to his strength and not in
justice, do not be astonished or let anything seem new to you.<span>  </span>God, who is highest above the high, sees
these things, He that placed His angels above the judges and kings of the

the Saviour at the end of the judges, and in the end of the world when the

dispersed easily and can be removed.<span>  </span>And
since anger is linked to pride, and the desire for vengeance, he says it is
better and above suffering, than he who is exalted in his spirit, and now shows
the sign of foolishness, since however powerful or wise someone is esteemed, if

power to obtain riches, which often the unrighteous own in greater quantity),
he therefore shows wisdom to be greater, saying "but the advantage of

than riches, because without any wealth it preserves those who think themselves
rich.<span>  </span>Certain scholars see this passage

association, by which we are the heirs of God, and co-heirs of Christ.<span>  </span>Therefore Ecclesiastes wants to teach how
much of a difference there is between those who merit seeing the sun (of
justice), and have wisdom by their good association, and those in contrast, who
without wisdom have only enthusiasm for vice and association.<span>  </span>Since even David shows this, saying "the

ruined".<span>  </span>That is he supplies from
the Holy Scriptures, or from thinking of the elements, to know and understand
those things, which are done; but not to ask the causes and reasons why one
thing is done in this way, or why it ought to have been done differently from
the way in which it has been done.<span>  </span>For

with him, who is holy; and the wicked are with him, who was previously wicked
by his own will.<span>  </span>This is similar also to
that which is written in Leviticus: "if the wicked came to me I will go to
them, wicked in my madness".<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref164" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[164]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>Even this can explain why God hardened the

to, but to me there seems a different meaning to this, which Symmachus has
translated, saying, 'in the good day, be good; but be wary of the day of
wickedness'.<span>  </span>All the same, God made this
world similar to the next, so that man should not be able to find that which he
complains against Him.<span>  </span>Suffer both the
good things, he says, and the bad, as they happen to you in your life.<span>  </span>And do not think that there is only the

of woman in Zechariah above the talent of lead.<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref178" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[178]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>Or we can take woman to be the devil
metaphorically on account of effeminate men; or indeed idolatry, and so that we
might proceed more closely, the church or heretics, which calls the fool to
itself by reasoning, so that he receives stolen bread, and stolen water, the
false sacrament, and is led to be baptised in polluted water.<span>   </span></span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">7:28/30.<span>  </span><i>Behold,
I have found this, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the
account.<span>  </span>Which still my soul seeks, but
I have not found it.<span>  </span>I have found one
man among a thousand, but one woman among all those I have not found. Only this
have I found: that God has made man righteous, but he has sought out many
inventions.<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">He says, "I found this", teaching
all things diligently, that by sinning little by little, and adding one crime
on top of another, we amass a great number of sins for ourselves.<span>  </span>'<i>esebon</i>'
even, which all translate as <i>logismon</i>
in Greek, according to the ambiguity of the Hebrew language can be said by us
to be 'number', 'sum', 'account', and 'consideration'.<span>  </span>But, he says, my spirit sought even this
question of whether woman is rightly found to be guilty.<span>  </span>And although I found scarcely any men to be
good, thus so that only one from a thousand can be found, I couldn't even find
one woman to be completely good.<span>  </span>For all
of them have led me not to virtue but to self-indulgence.<span>  </span>And because man's heart is predisposed
towards wickedness from boyhood, and almost all of us offend God in some way,
in this failing of mankind, women are more prone to this fate.<span>  </span>The famous poet says about this:
"inconstant and always changeable is woman"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref179" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[179]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>And the apostle says, "always learning

common to all mankind, or say that God the creator does evil things, because he
is the creator of these things, but he warns subtly those who are not able to
avoid evil, and says that we are created good by God; but he also says that
because we are left with our own free-will to deteriorate into a worse and
worse state through our own vices, while we seek greater things and contemplate
many things beyond our strength.<span>  </span>Differently:
while I consider the reason behind each and every one of these verses, I have
found no thought, which is not perturbed from outside by wicked thoughts.<span>  </span>But in a thousand men I have found one man,
who is made in the image of his creator; and not in a thousand of any kind, but
of one thousand <i>men</i>.<span>  </span>There is not a like number of women
corresponding to men.<span>  </span>In the thousand,
those who have not been close to a woman have therefore remained the most pure.<span>  </span>But all this must be taken as a
metaphor.<span>  </span>In many though, who enthuse
and every day sweat in their thinking, scarcely can there be found one pure
thought, that is worthy of the name of man.<span> 
</span>We can take thoughts for men though, and women for work, and say that
the thoughts of man can only be seen as pure with great difficulty.<span>  </span>But since the body does work, it is always
mixed up with some fault.<span>  </span>But instead of
that which we said above interpreting the Hebrew phrase, "one upon
another, so that a great accumulation is made" we could either say 'account',
or 'thought'; Symmachus interprets this more clearly, saying, "one upon
another makes an amount".<span>  </span>And we
are accustomed to call this complete and neutral, which I sought and had wanted
to find.<span>  </span>The Hebrews name this in the
case of females, just as in the phrase "I sought one from God, this I

boldness of his face is transformed.<span>  </span></b></span></i><span lang="EN-GB">He had taught above that it is hard to find
a good man, and he had answered the question to the contrary, saying that men
are made good by God, but that they fall into sin because of their own free
will.<span>  </span>Now he lists what qualities God
has given to a good man, to show his glory: wisdom obviously, and reason and
providence, and he knows that the secrets that are hidden by God enter his
heart.<span>  </span>But he is also talking about
himself here indirectly, because no one was as wise as Solomon was, and none
answered the problems he set.<span>   </span>And
because his wisdom was praised by all, wisdom which he not only carried on the
inside, but also wore on the surface of his skin, and which shone from his
face, he moreover imbued all men with the wisdom which shone forth from his
visage.<span>  </span>Where we have, 'who is like the
wise man?' the Septuagint reads: "who knows wise men?" and where we
read, 'the boldness of his face is transformed', the Septuagint has, "and
the unwise is disliked by his face".<span> 
</span>And although in fact there are many, who engage themselves in the
pursuit of wisdom, it is found with great difficulty, but he is able to tell a
wise man though from those, who only seem to be wise.<span>  </span>Though too there are even many more, who say
that they are able to let themselves tell the secrets of the Scriptures, it is
not common however, that one will actually find the true answer.<span>  </span>But what follows- "the wisdom of a man
will light up his face and the wicked is hated by his face" - can be
explained in the way that Paul explains it: "but we all see the glory of
God with our face uncovered"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref183" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[183]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>The writer of the Psalms also says, "the

different from the wisdom of God.<span> 
</span>Although it is the wisdom of God, it then begins to be also a part of
the human faculty, but only when it is in him who merits wisdom.<span>  </span>Every heretic, who defends his false
doctrines, shows his foolishness on his face.<span> 
</span>Then Marcion and Valentinus say that they are of a better nature than
the Creator himself!<span>  </span>This can be seen in
another way, if they contend to hope for this wisdom, but do not already
possess it.<span>    </span></span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">8:2/4<span>  </span><i>I

pleases.<span>  </span>Since a king's word is law, who
dare say to him, 'what are you doing?'<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">Here he seems to teach the same as the
apostle - that we should obey kings and rulers, which is set out in the
Septuagint as a command: "guard the command of the king"; but
personally I think he is now talking about that king about whom David says,
"Lord, the king will be happy in your virtue"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref185" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[185]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>And in another passage, where it means the
one reign of the Father and of the Son, the text reads, "God, give your
judgement to the king, and your righteousness to the son of the king".<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref186" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[186]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>For the Father does not judge each one, but
gives each judgement to the Son.<span> 
</span>Moreover, that king who is the Son of God, is the son of the Father who
is the King.<span>  </span>Therefore His precepts
should be kept, His will done.<span>  </span>And this
is exactly what is written in the book of Tobit: "it is good to hide the
secret of the king"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref187" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[187]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>He warns in particular why we should not ask
why God has taught every single thing, but see that teaching as a commandment,
and this is what an impious man hastens to fulfil.<span>  </span>Then let his will be the same as that of
God's law.<span>  </span>But because the Septuagint translates
this differently, saying, "do not hasten to run away from God's presence",
nor his judgement or his word, you must know that God's judgement is written in
the divine will.<span>  </span>Therefore we ought not
to recount to anyone or make public this judgement, which is taken to be sacred
and secret from the word of God, nor should we form rash opinions from it.<span>  </span>We should not, too, hasten like Moses, to see
the face of God, but rather wait a while until He Himself passes by and then we
will only see Him passing.<span>  </span>Nor too
should we do what follows: do not persist in an evil thing, and so on,
especially as we understand, like one who has already come into the madness of
heresy, or as he, who although having faith in the Church, is still overcome by
sins, so that he is unfaithful.<span>  </span>Do not
persevere in what is wrong, or in swearing, indulgence, greed, or lust.<span>  </span>For if you do the king of vices and devil of
sins will fashion in you your end, and he will be able to do whatever he wants
with you.</span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">8:5.<span>  </span><i>He who

but even a righteous man is not able to know what will befall him, or know the
causes and reasons for each thing, (for no one can know what will happen), but
he does know that all things are done by God to the advantage of man, and
nothing is done without His will.<span>  </span>For
this is a great sufferance for mankind, since as the poet says: "the mind
of man knows not his lot and coming fate"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref189" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[189]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>If he hopes for one thing, then another

here Theodotion and the Septuagint have said, "since the knowledge of man

'Daleth' are similar without the serif, instead of <i>raath </i>they have read <i>daat, </i>that
is instead of 'wickedness', 'knowledge'.<span> 
</span>This is easier to understand if you have knowledge of the language.<span>  </span>Note too, that which is written at the end of
the verse: 'since he doesn't know what has been, and what will be after him,
who will tell him?'<span>  </span>I have translated
word for word here from the Hebrew text, so that we can see that there is a
different meaning, since we are clearly not able to know those things which
have already passed away, or those that will be, as they have yet to be done.</span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">8:8.<span>  </span><i>Man is

the spirit from being taken from us, and when the spirit leaves to the realm of
God, it helps nothing to shut out mouth and hold in our fleeting life.<span>  </span>And when we are dead, the enemy of our life
will come and we are not able to take any rest.<span> 
</span>Note too the kings in one age, which destroying all our things
irreligiously led us by the hands to our death, but we were taken into the
ashes and the earth.<span>  </span>Therefore we must
not mourn if we cannot know the future and we are often oppressed by more
powerful and wicked men, for all things end in death: for the proud and the
powerful the same end; he who has devastated all things does not deserve to
keep his life when it is taken away.<span> 
</span>Another meaning could be that the spirit that is the source of life
cannot be prevented from leaving any man, this is the rule of mortality.<span>  </span>Above too he also spoke of this: "turning,

I saw that the impious were dead by such belief and buried, and were deemed
holy in the earth, but those who were living were thought to be worthy of the

their wickedness. "For the sinner is praised for the laxity of his soul,

dares to confront sinners and God does not immediately give punishment for
crimes, but rather postpones, so that we must await our repentance.<span>  </span>But since those who sin are not immediately
arrested and accused, they think with little regard that their judgement will
be in the future, and continue in their crime.<span> 
</span>We can see how this evidence pertains to certain bishops, who come to
power in the Church, and speak ill of those, which had taught and had urged
them to follow better pursuits.<span>  </span>These
men are very often praised after death in the Church, and blessed for those
things, which they in all likelihood did not even do, or openly are warned by
their successors or the congregation.<span> 
</span>And even this is vanity, since while they live they do not heed advice
and are not immediately visited for their sins, (since none dares accuse his
superior), besides they act as if holy and blessed, and as if they are walking
in the precepts of the Lord, and they increase their sins one on top of
another.<span>  </span>Such an accusation of a bishop
is difficult.<span>  </span>For you see, if he has

this is what is meant by, 'an hundred times': God gives a time for repentance,
and does not punish him immediately for his crime, but he waits so that he is
converted by his wickedness.<span>  </span>I
understand how good-willing and forgiving God will be to those who fear Him and
tremble at His word.<span>  </span>Symmachus
translated this passage as, "For a sinner dies wicked, long-life is

that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear His face, but it will not
be well for the wicked, and he will not live long, for he does not fear
God.<span>  </span>And because what Symmachus
translated is clear, we can say that the Hebrew word <i>maath </i>is what the Septuagint has translated as 'from then on',
which we have here as 'an hundred times'.<span> 
</span>Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have interpreted 'he has died' as
"he has sinned and done evil, and is dead", because for that which he
sinned, he immediately dies.<span>  </span>But
according to the interpretation of the Septuagint, instead of 'he is dead' we
read 'from then on', and according to that interpretation, the meaning is, 'a

follow the Septuagint's interpretation, which seems to take another meaning,
and says, "and I know, since those who fear God will be well, that they
fear his face, and the wicked will not be well, and his day will not be long in
shadows, who does not fear God."<span>  </span>He
could have said this: 'let there also be those things which I considered a

suffer wickedness as the sons of Aaron, and Manasseh, because the former died
while sacrificing, and the latter was restored to power after much wickedness

judged, while there will be a distinction between all things in the future when

death, and therefore they do not know the kingdom of God nor His hate.<span>  </span>Those who bring sacrifice and those who do

clearer way, saying, "but even the heart of mankind is filled with
wickedness and impudence like their heart in life".<span>  </span>But all of them succumb to death, for who is
able to continually live forever?<span>  </span>The
Scripture has the same meaning regarding this.<span> 
</span>I said a little earlier, that when both good and bad things happen
equally to everyone, there is no difference between good and bad, for we are
taken from this life by indiscriminate death.<span> 
</span>Nonetheless we are filled with wrongdoings and impudence and wickedness,
and after all these trials in life we are suddenly taken by death and
afterwards we cannot consort with the living.<span> 
</span>Or indeed it could mean this: since the same difficulties afflict both
the just and the unjust, men are therefore provoked to commit sins.<span>  </span>Then after he has tried all things, which are
done in vain, while he is unknowing, he descends to the world of the dead. <b><i>For

already perished- nor will they ever again have a share in whatever is done
beneath the sun.<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">Since he has said above that the heart of
man is filled with wickedness and impudence, and after all things, his life
comes to an end in death, then now he completes this by saying that he has
discovered that while men live, they are able to become righteous, but after
death are given no opportunity to do good work.<span> 
</span>For the sinner who lives can be better than the dead and righteous man,
if he wishes to convert to his virtues.<span> 
</span>Or indeed as for him, who threw himself into wickedness, power, and
impudence, then died: any poorest beggar is better than him.<span>  </span>Why?<span>  </span>Because
the living can carry out good work in the fear of death, but the dead can do
nothing to add to that which they took away from their life when they
died.<span>  </span>And all things are forgotten, just
as it is written in the Psalm: "I have been given to forget, though dead
from my heart"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref203" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[203]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>But even their enjoyment, hatred and
jealousy, and all that they were able to hold in their time, comes to an end
with their death; nor can they do anything now in their righteousness or sin,
or add to their virtues, or to their vices.<span> 
</span>Certain men though can argue against this explanation, asserting that we
can even grow after death, and equally decrease, and quoting that verse which
says, "and they will not share yet in all that is done under the
sun", and they understand it in this way, so that they say that they have
no communion in this world, and under this sun that we can see.<span>  </span>But they say that they do have it in another
world<b>, </b>about which the Saviour says,
"I am not of this world"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref204" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[204]</font></u></span></span></a>,
and under the sun of justice, but I have not excluded this theory, which
contends that after we leave this earth, we are able to offend reasoning
creatures, and deserve what we get.<span>  </span>My
Hebrew tutor thought differently of the verse, which says, "a living dog
is better than a dead lion".<span>  </span>He explained
it in this way according to the beliefs of his people: an unlearned man is more
useful, he who still lives and can teach, than a trained teacher who is now
dead.<span>  </span>Because of the text he understands
it to mean any one dog is better than many teachers, and the lion is Moses, or
any other prophet.<span>  </span>But because I don't
like this explanation I prefer a better one; and Chananaea to whom it is said:
"your faith saves you"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref205" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[205]</font></u></span></span></a>,
we say he is a dog according to the Gospel.<span> 
</span>But a dead lion, for the people of circumcision is just the same as for
Balaam, the prophet, who says, "behold the people shall rise up as a great
lion, and shall lift up himself as a young lion"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref206" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[206]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>Therefore we are a living dog amongst the
other nations; but the Jewish people which has been left by God, is a dead
lion.<span>  </span>And that living dog is seen as
better in God's eyes than a dead lion.<span> 
</span>For we who are living know the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<span>  </span>The dead though can know nothing, or await
any recompense and profit, since their memory is complete.<span>  </span>They don't remember what they ought to know,
and God does not remember them.<span> 
</span>Enjoyment too, for which they often loved God, will die, and hatred as
well, about which they say boldly, "surely I hate those who hate You, O
Lord, and am I not grieved with those that rise up against You?"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref207" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[207]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>And there does not exist their jealousy,

</span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">Regarding the
passage until that verse where he says: 'like fish caught in a fatal net, like
birds seized in a snare, so are men caught in the moment of disaster when it

be useful to link them together, so that it can be seen how all pertain to the
same meaning.<span>  </span>Because in a preceding
chapter he had said that after men have died they are cut off from the heart of
the living, and no one loves or hates them, as according to the poet, who says,
"there is no struggle from the dead, who lack breath"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref211" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[211]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>And because they can do no more under the
sun, now he introduces the idea of human madness and habit, whereby men of this
world encourage themselves in turn to enjoy good things; and <i>prosopopoiian</i>, using this in the manner
of rhetoricians and poets, saying: "O man, since there is nothing for you
after death, and death herself hears not my complaint, and while you live this
brief life, take pleasure in enjoyment, hold feasts, suppress your worries with
wine, and understand, since they are all given by God to be used by you.<span>  </span>Wear white clothes, and let your head smell
of ointments, and whichever woman pleases you, enjoy her embrace, thus lead
this empty and vain life in empty and vain pleasure.<span>  </span>For you will not have anything more than
this, which you enjoy.<span>  </span>Whatever you
like, grasp quickly, lest it disappears.<span> 
</span>You shouldn't fear the vain things mentioned, for the reason for each
individual work, either good or bad, will be given to you in the world of the
dead.<span>  </span>And there is no wisdom in death,
no sense of this life after passing away.<span> 
</span>He also says that Epicurus, Aristippus, and the philosophers of Cyrene<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref212" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[212]</font></u></span></span></a>,
and other of the philosophical flock hold this belief.<span>  </span>But I prefer my own ideas, and I do not find,
as some people think incorrectly, that everything happens by chance, and good
and bad fate plays on human lives.<span>  </span>I
rather believe that everything happens by the order of God.<span>  </span>For the fast runner should not think of his
running when he runs, nor a strong man have faith in his strength, or a wise
man think amassing great riches and wealth is prudent; the learned and
well-spoken should not be able to find himself amongst a flattering crowd
because of his eloquence and learning, but by attributing all things to be done
by God.<span>  </span>And unless he has ruled all
things in his own judgement, and built his own home, then they worked in vain,
who built it.<span>  </span>Except if he built a city,
those, who watch over it, will stay awake in vain.<span>  </span>For it is not as they think it is, that there
is one outcome and uncertainty in this life, since they do not think so, who
are suddenly taken away by death and taken to their judgement.<span>  </span>And just as fish are caught by a spear or in
nets, and birds are ensnared in a noose whilst they fly through the air
unknowing, in the same way men are led away to eternal prayer on account of
their merits, when sudden death comes and judges against them, who thought all
things in life happened by uncertainty.<span> 
</span>This is similar to that meaning by which we wanted to understand all
things in brief.<span>  </span>Now he speaks not as if
from another person's mouth, but for himself, each phrase must be looked at on
its own: "Go, eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a glad
heart, for God has already approved your deeds".<span>  </span>Since you learned that all things end with
death, and that repentance is not in the world of the dead, and that there is
no recourse to virtues, while you are in that situation, then hasten, struggle,
repent, while you still have the time.<span> 
</span>For God acknowledges repentance freely.<span> 
</span>Another meaning could be, that simply understanding is of use, according
to that verse, which says, "whether therefore you eat, or drink, or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref213" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[213]</font></u></span></span></a><i><span>  </span></i>And
in another place: drink wine with warning"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref214" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[214]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>For he who uses up more than his means does
not have true happiness and a good heart.<span> 
</span>But it is better to think this: the works of this man pleased God,
nonetheless he had need of bread and wine, because he has been spurned from the
vineyard of Sorek.<span>  </span>Therefore this
teaching has been given to us, as he says, "if you desire wisdom, then
keep the commandments and the Lord shall give it to you"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref215" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[215]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>Let us then keep the commandments and we will
be able to find bread and wine for the spirit.<span> 
</span>But he who does not keep the commandments prides himself in the
abundance of his bread and wine, and Isaiah says to him, "do not even say,
I know it, you do not know, or recognise, and your ears have not heard from the
beginning, for I knew that you would deal very treacherously"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref216" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[216]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>More precisely as it is said in the
interpretation given in the Septuagint: Come, eat your bread in happiness, this
is the word of Ecclesiastes, who even speaks in the Gospel: "If any man
thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref217" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[217]</font></u></span></span></a>
And in Proverbs: "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine.<span>  </span>Let your clothes be white forever and may
your hair be oiled<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref218" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[218]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>He therefore says, have a clean body and be
merciful.<span>  </span>Or in this way: 'let there not
be a time in which you do not have white clothes, beware lest you by accident
put on clothes that are not clean'.<span>  </span>A
known sinner was once described to have enjoyed dirty clothes.<span>  </span>But you should put on the light, not the
malediction, which was also written about Judah: "let a curse be worn like
clothes"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref219" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[219]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>Wear by your skin mercy, kindness, humility,
mildness and patience.<span>  </span>And when you have
been stripped, as an old man, of your work, take on new work, which is renewed
each day.<span>  </span>He also says, "and let your
hair not lack oil", you must remember that this is the nature of ointment,
that it reflects light and reduces the work of tiredness.<span>  </span>It is spiritual ointment, the ointment of
exultation, about which is written: "therefore God, your God, has anointed
you with the oil of gladness above your friends"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref220" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[220]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>This oil must gladden our face.<span>  </span>This oil must be put on the head of a faster,

in the Church that the ignorant and unskilled prosper.<span>  </span>And this is both because they have nourished
their boldness, and followed the fluency of their tongue, while they do not

they have the greatest favour of the populous, which delights and is brought
together more by more polished words.<span>  </span>On
the other hand a learned man lies in obscurity and suffers persecution; and not

there was a small town with only a few inhabitants; and a mighty king came upon
it and surrounded it, and built great siege works over it.<span>  </span>Present in the city was a poor wise man who
by his wisdom saved the town.<span>  </span>Yet no one
remembered that poor man.<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">While some people say that all things are
uncertain, and that the righteous have no more than the wicked, I see even the
greatest wisdom in this verse, because it happens repeatedly that there is a
small township with only a few inhabitants, and it is surrounded by an army of
a very powerful enemy, and the people inside is killed by the siege and by
hunger.<span>  </span>And suddenly and unexpectedly a
poor man is found, who has more wisdom than all the rich men, than all those
powerful and pompous men who are in danger, and who fear the siege.<span>  </span>And he thinks, seeks and finds an answer as
to how the town might be saved from the oppressors.<span>  </span>But O ungrateful oblivion of men, after they
were freed from bondage and released from captivity, and the freedom was given
back to the fatherland, no one remembers that wise old man, no one gives thanks
for their salvation, but all show honour to the rich, who were able to do
nothing to help when in time of danger.<span> 
</span>My Hebrew tutor interpreted this passage differently: the small town, he
says, is man, who even amongst learned men is called less clean.<span>  </span>And the few men in the town, are the members
by which the man shields and covers himself.<span> 
</span>But when a great king comes against it, that is the devil, and he
searches for a place by which he might break through, and in the town is found
a poor and wise man, that is the calm thought of that man on the inside, and
that is what saves the town, which is surrounded and besieged by the enemy.<span>  </span>And the man has been saved from danger, or
persecution, or disaster, or any other kind of adverse sin.<span>  </span>But that man on the outside, who is the enemy
of the wise and poor man on the inside, he does not remember the poor man, nor
does he remember his promises, but yet enjoys his freedom.<span>  </span>Differently: the small town and the few
inhabitants in it is the Church in comparison to the whole world.<span>  </span>And the great king the devil often comes against
it, not because he is great, but because he thought to be great, and he surrounds
the Church with a siege or persecution, or with another kind of disaster.<span>  </span>He finds in it a poor man who is wise, that
is our Lord Jesus Christ, who was made poor for us and is wisdom itself.<span>  </span>And that poor man frees the town with his
wisdom.<span>  </span>How many times do we see a
reclining lion in a trap with rich men, this is with the politicians and
leaders of our time, who come against the Church, but fail at the wisdom of
that poor man?<span>  </span>And when this poor man
has won and the town is restored to peace, scarcely anyone remembers him,
scarcely any of his requests are heard, but giving in to all indulgence and
pleasure, the inhabitants seek riches that are not necessary.</span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">9:16.<span>  </span><i>So I

unjust.<span>  </span>And it happens either through
not knowing, or without his will, that either in the rulers of the world, or in

to leave the face of the powerful and rulers.<span>

matter He is not acting justly, and judging as is correct.<span>  </span>More precisely, some men believe as their
predecessors do that there must be judgement so that He himself is powerful, a
topic that is mentioned before these verses: if a ruler comes up against you,

and the apostle doesn't forget to mention the building of the Church.<span>  </span>Therefore if anyone doing wrong by their
heresy, should take away those stones from the building of the Church, then he
will suffer torture afterwards.<span>  </span>Aquila
and Symmachus write about this man, and where we have 'he who moves about stones,
will suffer from them', both write, "he who moves stones, will be wounded
by them".<span>  </span>But because the Scripture
says very clearly, "he who moves about stones", or 'moves stones', he
does not add 'good' or 'bad'.<span>  </span>Moreover
and to the contrary it must be understood, that the man of the Church seemingly
a bishop and elder, (if we are taking this according to the mandate of
Leviticus), took a stone away from the house of lepers, and was obliterated in
dust and ashes.<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref252" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[252]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>And he will suffer for this himself, because
he was forced to take away a stone from the Church of Christ and saying,
(according to the apostle), "to weep with the weeping, to mourn with the
mourners"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref253" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[253]</font></u></span></span></a>,

it.<span>  </span>Heretics are non-fruit-bearing wood,
and copse that do not bear fruit.<span> 
</span>Pertaining to this too is that we must not plant a glade in the house of
God, and leafy openings, that is arbours of such sounding words are scorned.<span>  </span>However learned and wise a man may be
therefore who chops this wood with the sword of speech, he will be endangered
by it, unless he diligently pays attention.<span> 
</span>This is similar to what follows, this will happen, "if iron is
shaped" and its appearance is changed.<span> 
</span>This means that if his argument is found to be weaker, or if he does not
have a point, in which each argument is well balanced, then the argument of his
heart is blunt.<span>  </span>Then the strength of
wickedness will come upon him and fortify him.<span> 
</span>For this is what the Septuagint interprets this passage to mean: it
says, "and he is fortified by strength, and he will begin to have more
wisdom than strength; his wisdom will become strong, and superfluous, but it
will not help him who possesses it.</span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">10:10.<span>  </span><i>If a

preceding verses.<span>  </span>For with regard to the
sloth and the indolence of teachers the Church is lowered, and its roof is made
to fall, and its timbers leak, as we have shown above.<span>  </span>Therefore here he is speaking of the
self-same teachers.<span>  </span>And he has been seen
to accuse them, asking why they remain silent and do not make use of their duty
as teacher, (that is both for bishops and elders in the Church), saying that
they neither work on their speaking nor doctrine, the same that even Titus
admonishes<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref268" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[268]</font></u></span></span></a>,

so that one does not forget the grace of God, which is bestowed upon a great
man.<span>  </span>But in this respect they see
themselves as elders and bishops, so that they receive an allowance, and many
teachers ask for a two-fold glory, which is owed in fact to those who work on
their speaking and doctrines.<span>  </span>But now he
takes the other side and accuses those who even speak in the Church and teach
the congregation, but they teach the people that which they like to hear,
because he flatters the sinner in his crime and incites the listeners to
applaud.<span>  </span>For surely when such a teacher
is giving a lascivious speech in the Church, does he not promise the blessing
and realm of heaven to the crowd, as it will seem to you that his laughter
makes bread, and he mixes wine with the happiness of those who drink?<span>  </span>Or as those who teach and seek riches, food,
and wealth through the promised delights.<span> 
</span>Or the bread of the Church, which is the bread of mourners, and not of
those who laugh, because those who weep are blessed, for they will laugh, and
will have joy in their happiness.<span>  </span>He
also goes on to say: money or silver answers everything, and this must be taken
as two-fold: either that those learned men become rich after their praise, and
take their place at the head of the people, or indeed, since money is always
taken in return for a speech: for "the words of the LORD are pure words:
as silver extracted in a furnace of earth, purified seven times."<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref270" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[270]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>He asserts this because the ignoble crowd is
always moved easily by eloquence and speeches, which are composed of a great
foliage of words.<span>    </span>Differently: those
who have free-will and are forbidden to mourn and fast, make bread in their
laughter.<span>  </span>Isaac gets his name from this
bread as well, and in the happiness of drinking they prepare wine.<span>  </span>And so every holy man, who is teacher of the
Church, as Christ commanded, makes bread in his laughter and happiness, and hands
out cups of wine in his joy.<span>  </span>Money also,

your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when you
shall say, I have no pleasure in them;<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">In this chapter there were many explanations
of all things and almost as many opinions as men themselves.<span>  </span>It would take too long however to recount all
the opinions of everyone and their arguments in which they want to prove their
opinions, the matter would require a volume to itself.<span>  </span>But it is enough for wise men to have shown
what they feel, and like in a small picture, to have depicted the thirst of the
earth, the waste of the whole earth, and the belt of the ocean, and to have
shown them in such a small collection.<span> 
</span>The Hebrews believe the imperative here refers to Israel, to whom it is
taught that she should enjoy her riches, and before the time of bondage comes
should change youth to old-age. She should enjoy whatever is pleasant or fun,
just as it seems to the heart so it seems to the eyes; at that time while she
still has them to hand.<span>  </span>She knows
however that she will be judged in all things that she has done.<span>  </span>And just as from bad thoughts she flees from
desires, knowing that foolishness is joined to youth, and will remember always
her Creator, and before the days of Babylonian and Roman captivity come, in
which she will no longer be free.<span>  </span>And
all of this passage from the point which says, "before the sun, moon, and
stars become dark"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref289" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[289]</font></u></span></span></a>,

on earth just as it used to be and the soul returned to God who gave it"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref290" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[290]</font></u></span></span></a>,
they explain their condition.<span>  </span>And since
as I have said above these things are tiresome and favourable, they should be
touched by us but briefly and superficially.<span> 
</span>Therefore enjoy your youth O Israel, and do this or that, that has
already been mentioned before your time of bondage comes; and your glory will
leave you and pride, and judges, and your holy men who want to be interpreted
as the sun, moon, and stars, and are taken away.<span>  </span>Before Nebuchadnezzar comes, or Titus,
Vespasian's son, before the call of the prophets and their prophecies are
fulfilled.<span>  </span>In that day when the angels
that protect the temple leave, and the strongest men in your army are thrown in
confusion, and the speeches of the judges will be slow to come, and the
prophets, who are accustomed to receiving the light of their visions from
heaven, they all will become dark.<span>  </span>When
the doors of the temple are closed Jerusalem will be made humble and the
Chaldeans will come as if by the song of a bird, called thus in the words of
Jeremiah, and the singing girls with the lute in the temple choir will become
silent<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref291" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[291]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>At that time, when they will come to
Jerusalem, the enemies too will fear the greatness of God, and in the way of
doubt, they will fear the death of Sennacherib.<span> 
</span>For they also believe the saying, "and from up high they will fear
and tremble in the road"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref292" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[292]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>In those days "the almond tree will
flourish", that stick and staff which Jeremiah saw in his prophecy in the
beginning, "and the grasshopper will be a burden"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref293" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[293]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>Nebuchadnezzar with his army, "and
desire shall fail ", the friendship between Israel and God.<span>  </span>But what desire wants for itself, although we
have begun to speak about them individually will be explained more fully.<span>  </span>But all this will happen to Israel, because
man will go out into the house of his eternity, and having returned from the
protection of God to the heavens, going to his tabernacle, the weeping and
crying will wander in the street and will be hemmed in by the enemy's
siege.<span>  </span>Be happy therefore Israel in your
youth, before the silver cord is broken, (this is until your glory is with
you), before the golden ribbon breaks off, (that is before the arc of the
tabernacle is taken away); before the pitcher is worn away to the fountain, and
the wheel is turned around over the pool.<span> 
</span>That is until you read the most sacred teachings, for the spirit of a
holy man is grace, and before you return to Babylon, from whence you left the
loins of Abraham, and you will begin to be worn away in Mesopotamia, which once
breathed life into you, and all is returned to He who gave it.<span>  </span>The Jews have always taught these things and
have understood this chapter to pertain to themselves.<span>  </span>But I prefer to return to the previous argument,
and try to explain each thing individually: "rejoice O youth, in your
adolescence, and let your heart be good in the days of your youth, and walk in
the way of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; and know above all these
things, since God will lead you into judgement".<span>  </span>He has said that the light of this world is
the sweetest and that man ought to rejoice in the days of his life, and grasp
desire with all enthusiasm.<span>  </span>For the
eternal night of death will fall when it's not permitted to enjoy ones amassed
wealth and like a shadow, all things that we possess, will die.<span>  </span>Now therefore he encourages man and says,
"O youth, before old-age and death fall upon you, enjoy your youth, and
whatever you feel is good, and seems joyful to see, take it and enjoy as it
please you the things of this world."<span> 
</span>Again so that he does not think these things say to provoke men to
indulgence, and thus fall into the doctrines of Epicurus, he takes this
suspicion, saying, "and know, since above all these God will lead you to
judgement".<span>  </span>Thus, he says, take
advantage of the things of the world, so that you know you will be judged in
the end.<span>  </span>"And force anger from your
heart and take wickedness from your flesh, since youth and foolishness are
vanity".<span>  </span>In anger he sees all the
problems of the spirit.<span>  </span>In the
wickedness of the flesh he sees every desire of the body.<span>  </span>In this way therefore, he says, enjoy the
goodness of this world, lest you leave pleasure or flesh.<span>  </span>Leave off your former vices, which you did in
your youth of vanity and foolishness, since youth is joined to
foolishness.<span>  </span>"And remember in the
day of your youth Him, who created you, before the days of wickedness come and
the years approach, in which you will say, 'I have no will'".<span>  </span>Always remember your Creator and walk the
route of your youth, so that you remember your end is death, before your time
comes, in which sad things will happen.</span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">12:2.  <i>While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or

not buy oil.<span>  </span>Or even, while the virgins
are wandering in the streets, husbands close each room when they have entered
into it.<span>  </span>For if the road is thin and

be different again, if we do not follow the context of this chapter, it can be
taken to mean the real resurrection, when the death will rise up to the voice
of the arch-angel.<span>  </span>And it is not
surprising, if we compare the trumpet of an angel to a sparrow, when all night
is compared to Christ, if it is clement.<span> 
</span>And also this is not too surprising, if my memory serves me right, when
I have never read of a sparrow in a bad light.<span>

closed doors in the street, as the weak steps of an old man, because he always
sits and cannot walk.<span>  </span>The weakness of
the voice of the grinder is interpreted as in his jaws, because he cannot chew
food, and scarcely reduced in spirit, his voice is heard only quietly.<span>  </span>More precisely he shows him to rise to the
sound of a bird, because now with cold blood and dry organs by which sleep is
nourished, he wakes to a soft sound, and in the middle of the night, when the
cock crows, he rises quickly; but he is not able to move his limbs from his
bed.<span>  </span>And he becomes silent too, or as it
is better put in the Hebrew, the daughters of song become deaf, (meaning ears),
because it is harder for old-men to hear noises and there is less distinction
between voices, or enjoy songs.<span>  </span>Also

speech now explains the limbs of a man of the Church through a metaphor.<span>  </span>And when old-age comes his hair will grow
white, his feet will swell, his lust will grow cold and he will be destroyed by
death.<span>  </span>Then he will be returned to the

ashes with reverence, and a crowd will walk before the mourners at his
funeral.<span>  </span>But the flower of the almond-tree,
which we have in place of grey hairs, some interpret as the sacred thorn,
because, while the flesh of the buttocks decreases, the thorn grows and
flowers.<span>  </span>More precisely, in that verse
which says, "the grasshopper will be a burden", you must note that
where we have in our manuscripts 'grasshopper', the Hebrew has <i>aagab</i>, which is rather ambiguous for
us.<span>  </span>For it can be translated as 'heel'
or as 'grasshopper'.<span>  </span>Just as for example
in the beginning of Jeremiah, the word <i>soced</i>
if the accent is changed can mean 'a nut' or 'wakefulness'.<span>  </span>And this is said to him: "what do you
see, Jeremiah?" and he replies, "a nut".<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref306" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[306]</font></u></span></span></a><span>  </span>And the Lord says to him, "you have seen

etymology of the word 'nut', because God is about to keep awake.<span>  </span>And what the people has deserved it will be
given, is what the text seems to say.<span> 
</span>Thus now he shows the ambiguity of the word through its etymology,
showing that the legs of old men swell up and that gout weighs upon the organs.<span>  </span>This does not happen to all men, but to most,
and this is <i>synecdoche</i> where a part
is called by the name of the whole.<span> 
</span>Indeed where we read 'desire' the Hebrew has <i>abiona.<span>  </span></i>This in itself has
many meanings, and is interpreted as 'love', 'lust', 'longing', or
'desire'.<span>  </span>And it has the meaning, as I
have said above, that the lust of an old man grows cold, and the organs of
intercourse sag.<span>  </span>But this is said
because these words are ambiguous, for although they mean 'almond-tree', and
'grasshopper', and 'desire' in his language, they also mean other derived words
in our language, and are derived from the forms which pertain to old-age.<span>  </span>You must note too, that where the Septuagint
has the word 'almond-tree' the word itself is <i>soced</i>, which is found in the beginning of Jeremiah.<span>  </span>But there it is meant 'nut' but here it means
'almond-tree'.<span>   </span>Symmachus has
interpreted this passage in a greatly different way, (though I am unsure of what
he means): for he says, 'and they will see even above these things from on
high, and they will wander, and waking he will fall asleep, and the strength of
his spirit will be dispersed.'<span>  </span>For man
will go to the house of his eternity, and the weeping will wander in the
street.<span>  </span>Laodicenus<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref308" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[308]</font></u></span></span></a>
followed the interpretation of Symmachus, which the Hebrews do not like, nor
the Christians; for while he is far from the Hebrews' view, he rejects too the
interpretations of the Septuagint.<span>  </span></span></font></p><p style="text-align:justify;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0pt"><font size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB">12:6/8.  <i>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the

dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who
gave it.<span>  </span>Vanity of vanities says Ecclesiastes;
all is vanity.<span>  </span></i></span></b><span lang="EN-GB">He returns to former matter and after a
rather large exaggeration, -which he interposes in this place, in which he
says, "and remember your Creator, in the day of your youth; before the
days of wickedness come, and before the sun, moon grow dark" and so on,
"in the day in which the keepers of the house are renewed". - now he
finishes the point he had begun in a similar way, saying, "before the
silver cord is broken", and this or that happens.<span>  </span>But he shows the silver cord to be this white
band, and the space that divides us from heaven.<span>  </span>It also means the gold band, which returns to
the place whence it came down.<span>  </span>more
precisely the two that follow, the wearing of the jug on the fountain, and the
breaking of the wheel by the pond, are metaphorical images of death.<span>  </span>For death is just like the jug, which is worn
down, stops to fill, and the wheel by which water is carried from a well or
pond, if it has been broken.<span>  </span>Thus the
interpretation of the Septuagint has it that the usage of water is twisted in
this rope; thus when the silver cord is broken, and the river of the spirit
flows back to the fountain, the man will die.<span> 
</span>He goes on more clearly: "the dust will return to the earth, whence
it was taken, and the spirit is returned to God, who gave it".<span>  </span>From which there is enough to smile at in
those who think that spirits are produced with bodies, not from God, but are
made from the parent's body.<span>  </span>For when
the flesh is returned to the earth, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave
it; it is obvious that God is the parent of all spirits, not man.<span>  </span>Then after the description of man's death, he
goes back to the beginning of his book, saying, "vanity of vanities, says

of men he now professes at the end, because he was not happy with the use of
the old law, but therefore immersed himself in trying to solve difficult

that which is written, and this is the method used in teaching in the Gospels,

a fruit is found inside the hairy covering of its peel.<span>  </span>Thus we must search for another meaning in
them which pertains to God.<span>  </span>Before this
though he mentions that he desired to know the workings of the world and the
wisdom and mind of God.<span>  </span>He wanted to

that philosophers and teachers of this world teach, who try to assert the
falsities of their doctrines with flamboyant and unnecessary language.<span>  </span>On the other hand divine scripture is
restricted by the small quantity of what is written, and however much it is
enlarged by people's opinions it is restricted by the text itself.<span>  </span>This is because the Lord has made speech
concise and brief all over the world, and His word is the same when it is

which pertains to reading is more the toil of the mind.<span>  </span>It seems to me from this that the above points
from the several books must be considered differently to the way in which many
believe them to be.<span>  </span>It is the custom of
the Scriptures that, no matter how many books there are, if they all follow the
same matter are have few differences, then we can say that they are one
book.<span>  </span>In this way the Gospel and the
"immaculate law of the Lord, converting spirits"<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref314" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[314]</font></u></span></span></a>

it is a teaching that there should not be too many books.<span>  </span>For whatever you say, if it is told to him
who was with God in the beginning, the word then is God<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref318" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[318]</font></u></span></span></a>,
as one volume, and the many books are the one law, which is called the
Gospel.<span>  </span>But if you argue that they are
varied and differ too much to be in the same volume, and look at them with too
much curiosity, even within each book you will see that there are many
books.<span>  </span>They say about this: "you

end.<span>  </span>And the more they are sought, the
more they come about.<span>  </span>Study and
consideration of this is toil of the body.<span>

writings of Solomon in the past, they have not persisted in memory; and this
book seems as if it ought to have been omitted, because it asserts that all
God's creations are vain and that he thinks everything is done for nothing, and
he prefers food and drink and transient pleasures to all things; thus he takes
his authority from this one title, so it is now included in the number of
divine books, because he argues well and lists many things like <i>anakephaiosei, </i>and he said that his
speeches are the easiest to hear, and to understand; let us therefore fear God
and carry out his commandments.<span>  </span>For man
is born for this purpose and, understanding his Creator, he reveres Him in fear
and respect, and in the work of his commandments.<span>  </span>And when the time of judgement comes whatever
we have done will stand before the judge and for a long time we will await our
judgement which could go one way or the other, and we will receive our just
rewards, whether they be good or bad.<span> 
</span>But where we read, "with every secret thing", Symmachus and the
Septuagint have interpreted, "from all contempt", or even "from
all unknown", which even brought by reluctant words, not by will, but by
ignorance, we will be returned to reason in the day of our judgement.<span>  </span>Differently: since fear is more appropriate
to slaves, and perfect love involves no fear, and fear in the divine Scripture
is used to denote those embarking on and those completing education<a href="javascript:void(0);" name="_ftnref322" title=""><span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><u><font color="#7c4dff">[322]</font></u></span></span></a>.<span>  </span>Now I think he talks about the fear inherent

not yet taken the name of God, he has this reason of his wealth, so that he
fears God while he is still alive.<span>  </span>Since
every single deed is judged, that is, God leads all men into judgement about
all things, either good or bad, which are done and said differently than by

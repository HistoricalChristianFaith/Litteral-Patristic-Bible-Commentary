For not a carnal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> ought ours to be. To wish a man temporal good, is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>; but though that fail, let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> be safe.

But haply both to your friend the life you wish him is not for his good, and to your enemy the death you rejoice at has been for his good. It is uncertain whether this present life be profitable to any man or unprofitable: but the life which is with God without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> is profitable.

He was casting out from them the death which is for ever and ever, by His most merciful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, and by His most surpassing might. Many of them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, and the shedding of the blood of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> was forgiven them. At first they shed it while they raged; now they drank it while they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. <q>In this we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that we are in Him, if in Him we be made perfect.</q> Touching the very perfection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of enemies, the Lord admonishing, says, <q>Be therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse48" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:48</font></u></a></span> He,</q> therefore, <q>that says he abides in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.</q></p>

That be far from us! It is this then, that we walk in the way of righteousness. In what way? I have already mentioned it. He was fixed upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, and yet was He walking in this very way: this way is the way of charity, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what they do.</q> If, therefore, you have learned to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for your enemy, you walk in the way of the Lord.</p>

But the Psalm says, The sun shall not burn you by day, neither the moon by night: <em>i.e.</em>, if you hold fast charity, neither in Christ shall you have occasion of falling, nor in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; neither Christ shall you forsake, nor the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. For he that forsakes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, how is he in Christ who is not in the members of Christ? How is he in Christ who is not in the body of Christ? Those therefore take scandal, or, occasion of falling, who forsake Christ or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Whence do we understand that the Psalm in saying, <q>By day shall the sun not burn you, nor the moon by night,</q> says it of this, that the burning means scandal, or occasion of stumbling? In the first place mark the similitude itself. Just as the person whom something is burning says, I cannot bear it, I cannot away with it, and draws back; so those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who cannot bear some things in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and withdraw themselves either from the name of Christ or from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, are taking scandal. For see how those took scandal as from the sun, those carnal ones to whom Christ preached of His flesh, saying, <q>He that eats not the flesh of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> and drinks His blood, shall have no life in him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh006.htm#verse54" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 6:54-69</font></u></a></span> Some seventy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> said, <q>This is an hard saying,</q> and went back from Him, and there remained the twelve. All those the sun burnt, and they went back, not being able to bear the force of the Word. There remained therefore the twelve. And lest haply men should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that they confer a benefit upon Christ by believing on Christ, and not that the benefit is conferred by Him upon them; when the twelve were left, the Lord said to them, <q>Will you also go?</q> That you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that I am necessary to you, not you to me. But those whom the sun had not burnt, answered by the voice of Peter: <q>Lord, You have the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life; whither shall we go?</q> But who are they that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> as the moon burns by night? They that have made schisms. Hear the very word used in the apostle: <q>Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 11:29</font></u></a></span> In what sense then is it, that there is no scandal or occasion of stumbling in him that loves his brother? Because he that loves his brother, bears all things for unity's sake; because it is in the unity of charity that brotherly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> exists. Some one, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not who, offends you: whether it be a bad man, or as you suppose a bad man, or as you pretend a bad man: and do you desert so many good men? What sort of brotherly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is that which has appeared in these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>? While they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the whole world! What, were there no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> in the whole world? Or was it possible they should be condemned by you unheard? But oh! If you loved your brethren, there would be none occasion of stumbling in you. Hear the Psalm, what it says: <q>Great peace have they that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Your law, and there is to them none occasion of stumbling.</q> Great peace it says there is for them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and that is why there is to them none occasion of stumbling. Those then who take scandal, or, occasion of stumbling, destroy peace. And of whom says he that they take not and make not occasion of stumbling? They that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> God's law. Consequently they are in charity. But some man will say, <q>He said it of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> God's law, not of the brethren.</q> Hear what the Lord says: <q>A new commandment give I unto you that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> one another.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh013.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 13:34</font></u></a></span> What is the Law but commandment? Moreover, how is it they do not take occasion of stumbling, but because they forbear one another? As <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, <q>Forbearing one another in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, studying to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph004.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 4:2-3</font></u></a></span> And to show that this is the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, hear the same apostle commending this very law. <q>Bear one another's burdens,</q> says he, <q>and so shall you fulfill the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:2</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p><q>For he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not whither he goes.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:11</font></u></a></span> A great thing, my brethren: mark it, we beseech you. <q>He that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> his brother walks in darkness, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not whither he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</q> What so blind as these who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> their brethren? For that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that they are blind, they have stumbled at a Mountain. I say the same things often, that they may not slip out of your memory. The Stone which was <q>cut out of the Mountain without hands,</q> is it not Christ, who came of the kingdom of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, without the work of man? Has not that Stone broken in pieces all the kingdoms of the earth, that is, all the dominations of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>? Has not that Stone grown, and become a great mountain, and filled the whole earth? Do we point with the finger to this Mountain in like manner as the moon on its third day is pointed out to men? For example, when they wish people to see the new moon, they say, Lo, the moon! lo, where it is! And if there be some there who are not sharp-sighted, and say, Where? Then the finger is put forth that they may see it. Sometimes when they are ashamed to be thought blind, they say they have seen what they have not seen. Do we in this way point out the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, my brethren? Is it not open? Is it not manifest? Has it not possessed all nations? Is not that fulfilled which so many years before was promised to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, that in his seed should all nations be blessed? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen022.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 22:18</font></u></a></span> It was promised to one believer, and the world is filled with thousands of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>. Behold here the mountain filling the whole face of the earth! Behold the city of which it is said, <q>A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid!</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:14</font></u></a></span> But those stumble at the mountain, and when it is said to them, Go up; <q>There is no mountain,</q> say they, and dash their heads against it sooner than seek a habitation there. Esaias was read yesterday; whosoever of you was awake not with his eyes only but with his ear, and not the ear of the body but the ear of the heart, noted this; <q>In the last days shall the mountain of the house of the Lord be manifest, prepared upon the top of the mountains.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa002.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 2:2</font></u></a></span> What so manifest as a mountain? But there are even mountains unknown, because they are situated in one part of the earth. Which of you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> Mount Olympus? Just as the people who dwell there do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> our Giddaba. These mountains are in different parts of the earth. But not so that Mountain, for it has filled the whole face of the earth, and of it is said, <q>Prepared upon the top of the mountains.</q> It is a Mountain above the tops of all mountains. <q>And,</q> says he, <q>to it shall be gathered all nations.</q> Who can fail to be aware of this Mountain? Who breaks his head by stumbling against it? Who is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the city set upon a mountain? But marvel not that it is unknown by these who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> the brethren, because they walk in darkness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not whither they go, because the darkness has blinded their eyes. They do not see the Mountain: I would not have you marvel; they have no eyes. How is it they have no eyes? Because the darkness has blinded them. How do we prove this? Because they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> the brethren, in that, while they are offended at Africans, they separate themselves from the whole earth: in that they do not tolerate for the peace of Christ those whom they defame, and do tolerate for the sake of Donatus those whom they condemn.</p>

For He opened to them the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> and showed them that it behooved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10582c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Law of Moses</font></u></a>, and the Prophets, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170202.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalms</font></u></a>.

All that there is of those former Scriptures tells of Christ; but only if it find ears.

<p>But what did the Lord show written of Him in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10582c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Law of Moses</font></u></a>, and the Prophets, and the Psalms? What did He show? Let Himself say. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> has put this briefly, that we might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what in all that great compass of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> we ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> and to understand. Certainly there are many pages, and many books; the contents of them all is this which the Lord briefly spoke to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. What is this? That <q>it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again the third day.</q> You have it now concerning the Bridegroom, that <q>it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again:</q> the Bridegroom has been set forth to us. Concerning the Bride, let us see what He says; that you, when you know the Bridegroom and the Bride, may not without reason come to the marriage. For every celebration is a celebration of marriage: the Church's nuptials are celebrated. The King's Son is about to marry a wife, and that King's Son is Himself a King: and the guests frequenting the marriage are themselves the Bride. Not, as in a carnal marriage, some are guests, and another is she that is married; in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> they that come as guests, if they come to good purpose, become the Bride. For all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> is Christ's Bride, of which the beginning and first fruits is the flesh of Christ: there was the Bride joined to the Bridegroom in the flesh. With good reason when He would betoken that same flesh, He broke bread, and with good reason <q>in the breaking of bread,</q> the eyes <q>of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> were opened, and they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> Him.</q> Well then, what did the Lord say was written of Him in the Law and Prophets and Psalms? That <q>it behooved Christ to suffer.</q> Had He not added, <q>and to rise again,</q> well might those mourn whose eyes were holden; but <q>to rise again</q> is also foretold. And wherefore this? Why did it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise again? Because of that Psalm which we especially commended to your attention on the fourth day, the first station, of last week. Why did it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise again? For this reason: <q>All the ends of the earth shall be reminded and converted unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him.</q> For that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise again; in this place also what has He added, that after setting forth the Bridegroom He might also set forth the Bride? <q>And that there be preached,</q> says He, <q>in His name, repentance and remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q> You have heard, brethren; hold it fast. Let no man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, that it is <q>throughout all nations:</q> let no man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> that it began at Jerusalem, and has filled all nations. We <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the field where the Vine is planted: but when it is grown we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it not, because it has taken up the whole. Whence did it begin? <q>At Jerusalem.</q> Whither has it come? To <q>all nations.</q> A few remain: it shall possess all. In the mean time, while it is taking possession of all, it has seemed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> to the Husbandman to cut off some unprofitable branches, and they have made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresies</font></u></a> and schisms. Let not the branches that are cut off induce you to be cut off: rather exhort them that are cut off that they be grafted in again. It is manifest that Christ has suffered, is risen again, and is ascended into heaven: made manifest also is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, because there is <q>preached in His name repentance and remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> throughout all nations.</q> Whence did it begin? <q>Beginning at Jerusalem.</q> The man hears this; foolish and vain, and (how, shall I express it?) worse than blind! so great a mountain, and he does not see it; a candle set upon a candlestick, and he shuts his eyes against it!</p>
<p>When we say to them, If you be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Catholic</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>, communicate with that Church from which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> is spread abroad over the whole earth: communicate with that Jerusalem: when this we say to them, they make answer to us, we do not communicate with that city where our King was slain, where our Lord was slain: as though they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> the city where our Lord was slain. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> slew Him whom they found on earth, these scorn Him that sits in heaven! Which are the worse; those who despised Him because they thought Him man, or those who scorn the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacraments</font></u></a> of Him whom now they confess to be God? But they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a>, forsooth, the city in which their Lord was slain! Pious men, and merciful! They much grieve that Christ was slain, and in men they slay Christ! But He loved that city, and pitied it: from it He bade the preaching of Him begin, <q>beginning at Jerusalem.</q> He made there the beginning of the preaching of His name: and you shrink back with horror from having communion with that city! No marvel that being cut off you hate the root. What said He to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>? <q>Sit still in the city, because I send my promise upon you.</q> Behold what the city is that they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a>! Haply they would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> it, if Christ's murderers dwelt in it. For it is manifest that all Christ's murderers, <em>i.e.</em>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, are expelled from that city. That which had in it them that were fierce against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, has now them that adore Christ. Therefore do these men <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> it, because <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a> are in it. There was it His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> that His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> should tarry, and there that He should send to them the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>. Where had the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> its commencement, but where the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> came from heaven, and filled the hundred and twenty sitting in one place? That number twelve was made tenfold. They sat, an hundred and twenty <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> came, <q>and filled the whole place, and there came a sound, as it were the rushing of a mighty wind, and there were cloven tongues like as of fire.</q> You have heard the Acts of the Apostles: this was the lesson read today: <q>They began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</q> And all who were on the spot, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> who had come from various nations, recognised each his own tongue, and marvelled that those unlearned and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> men had on the sudden learned not one or two tongues, but the tongues of all nations whatsoever. There, then, where all tongues sounded, there was it betokened that all tongues should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. But these men, who much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and therefore refuse to communicate with the city which killed Christ, so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> Christ as to affirm that He is left to two tongues, the Latin and the Punic, <em>i.e.</em> African. Christ possess only two tongues! For there are but these two tongues on the side of Donatus, more they have not. Let us awake, my brethren, let us rather see the gift of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a>, and let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> the things spoken before concerning Him, and let us see fulfilled the things spoken before in the Psalm: <q>There are neither speeches nor discourses, but their voices are heard among them.</q> And lest haply the case be so that the tongues themselves came to one place, and not rather that the gift of Christ came to all tongues, hear what follows: <q>Into all the earth is their sound gone out, and unto the ends of the world their words.</q> Wherefore this? Because <q>in the sun has He set His tabernacle,</q> <em>i.e.</em>, in the open light. His tabernacle, His flesh: His tabernacle, His Church: <q>in the sun</q> it is set; not in the night, but in the day. But why do those not acknowledge it? Return to the lesson at the place where it ended yesterday, and see why they do not acknowledge it: <q>He that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> his brother, walks in darkness, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not whither he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</q> For us then, let us see what follows, and not be in darkness. How shall we not be in darkness? If we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the brethren. How is it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> that we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the brotherhood?

For you He became temporal, that you might become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>; because He also in such sort became temporal, that He remained still <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>. Something was added to Him from time, not anything went from His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternity</font></u></a>. But you were born temporal, and by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> wast made temporal: you were made temporal by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, He was made temporal by mercy in remitting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. How great the difference, when two are in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, between the criminal and him that visits him!

The one, his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> presses down: the other, humanity has brought there. So in this our mortal state, we were held fast by our guiltiness, He in mercy came down: He entered in unto the captive, a Redeemer not an oppressor. The Lord for us shed His blood, redeemed us, changed our hope. As yet we bear the mortality of the flesh, and take the future <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a> upon trust: and on the sea we are tossed by the waves, but we have the anchor of hope already fixed upon the land.</p>
<p>But let us <q>not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the world, neither the things that are in the world.

What is the garniture of the sea? All creeping things. What of the earth? animals, trees, flying creatures. These are 'in the world,' God made them. Why then am I not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> what God has made?</q> Let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a> be in you, that you may see that all these things are good: but woe to you if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the things made, and forsake the Maker of them! Fair are they to you: but how much fairer He that formed them! Mark well, beloved. For by similitudes you may be instructed: lest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> steal upon you, saying what he is wont to say, Take your enjoyment in the creature of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; wherefore made He those things but for your enjoyment? And men drink themselves drunken, and perish, and forget their own Creator: while not temperately but lustfully they use the things created, the Creator is despised. Of such says the apostle: <q>They worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed for ever.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:25</font></u></a></span> God does not forbid you to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> these things, howbeit, not to set your affections upon them for blessedness, but to approve and praise them to this end, that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> your Creator. In the same manner, my brethren, as if a bridegroom should make a ring for his bride, and she having received the ring, should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> it more than she loves the bridegroom who made the ring for her: would not her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> be found guilty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> in the very gift of the bridegroom, albeit she did but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> what the bridegroom gave her? By all means let her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> what the bridegroom gave: yet should she say, <q>This ring is enough for me, I do not wish to see his face now:</q> what sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> would she be? Who would not detest such folly? Who not pronounce her guilty of an adulterous mind? You love gold in place of the man, lovest a ring in place of the bridegroom: if this be in you, that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> a ring in place of your bridegroom, and hast no wish to see your bridegroom; that he has given you an earnest, serves not to pledge you to him, but to turn away your heart from him! For this the bridegroom gives earnest, that in his earnest he may himself be loved. Well then, God gave you all these things: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him that made them. There is more that He would fain give you, that is, His very Self that made these things. But if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> these— what though God made them— and neglect the Creator and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the world; shall not your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> be accounted adulterous? </p>
<p>For <q>the world</q> is the appellation given not only to this fabric which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> made heaven and earth, the sea, things visible and invisible: but the inhabitants of the world are called the world, just as we call a <q>house</q> both the walls and them that inhabit therein. And sometimes we praise a house, and find fault with the inhabitants. For we say, A good house; because it is marbled and beautifully ceiled: and in another sense we say, A good house: no man there suffers wrong, no acts of plunder, no acts of oppression, are done there. Now we praise not the building, but those who dwell within the building: yet we call it <q>house,</q> both this and that. For all lovers of the world, because by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> they inhabit the world, just as those inhabit heaven, whose heart is on high while in the flesh they walk on earth: I say then, all lovers of the world are called the world. The same have only these three things, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the flesh, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the eyes, vain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of life.</q> For they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> to eat, drink, cohabit: to use these pleasures. Not surely, that there is no allowed measure in these things, or that when it is said, Love not these things, it means that you are not to eat, or not to drink, or not to beget children? This is not the thing said. Only, let there be measure, because of the Creator, that these things may not bind you by your loving of them: lest you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> that for enjoyment, which you ought to have for use. But you are not put to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> except when two things are propounded to you, this or that: Will you righteousness or gains? I have not wherewithal to live, have not wherewithal to eat, have not wherewithal to drink. But what if you can not have these but by iniquity? Is it not better to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> that which you lose not, than to lose yourself by iniquity? You see the gain of gold, the loss of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> you see not. This then, says he to us, is <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the flesh,</q> <em>i.e.</em> the lusting after those things which pertain to the flesh, such as food, and carnal cohabitation, and all other such like.</p>
<p><q>And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the eyes:</q> by <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the eyes,</q> he means all curiosity.

<p>These three there are, and you can find nothing whereby <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> cupidity can be tempted, but either by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the flesh, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of the eyes, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> of life.

<div><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:18</font></u> <q>Children, it is the last hour.</q> In this lesson he addresses the children that they may make haste to grow, because <q>it is the last hour.</q> Age or stature of the body is not at one's own will. A man does not grow in respect of the flesh when he will, any more than he is born when he will: but where the being born rests with the will, the growth also rests with the will. No man is <q>born of water and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh003.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 3:5</font></u></a></span> except he be willing. Consequently if he will, he grows or makes increase: if he will, he decreases. What is it to grow? To go onward by proficiency. What is it to decrease? To go backward by deficiency. Whoso <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that he is born, let him hear that he is an infant; let him eagerly cling to the breasts of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170203.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mother</font></u></a>, and he grows apace. Now his mother is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; and her breasts are the two Testaments of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Divine Scriptures</font></u></a>. Hence let him suck the milk of all the things that as signs of spiritual truths were done in time for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, that being nourished and strengthened, he may attain to the eating of solid meat, which is, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh001.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 1:1</font></u></a></span> Our milk is Christ in His humility; our meat, the selfsame Christ equal with the Father. With milk He nourishes you, that He may feed you with bread: for with the heart spiritually to touch Christ is to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that He is equal with the Father.</div>
<div>
<p>Therefore it was that He forbade Mary to touch Him, and said to her, <q>Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father.</q> What is this? He gave Himself to be handled by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and did He shun Mary's touch? Is not He the same that said to the doubting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, <q>Reach hither your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170203.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fingers</font></u></a>, and feel the scars</q>? Was He at that time ascended to the Father? Then why does He forbid Mary, and says, <q>Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to the Father?</q> Or are we to say, that He feared not to be touched by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170203.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and feared to be touched by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>? The touch of Him cleanses all flesh. To whom He willed first to be manifested, by them feared He to be handled? Was not His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a> announced by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> to the men, that so the serpent should by a sort of counterplot be overcome? For because he first by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> announced death to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, therefore to men was also life announced by a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>. Then why was He unwilling to be touched, but because He would have it to be understood of that spiritual touch? The spiritual touch takes place from a pure heart. That person does of a pure heart reach Christ with his touch who understands Him coequal with the Father. But whoso does not yet understand Christ's Godhead, that person reaches but unto the flesh, reaches not unto the Godhead. Now what great matter is it, to reach only unto that which the persecutors reached unto, who crucified Him? But that is the great thing, to understand the Word God with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in the beginning, by whom all things were made: such as He would have Himself to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> when He said to Philip, <q>Am I so long time with you, and have you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> me, Philip? He that sees me, sees also the Father.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 14:9</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>But lest any be sluggish to go forward, let him hear: <q>Children, it is the last hour.</q> Go forward, run, grow; <q>it is the last hour.</q> This same last hour is long; yet it is the last. For he has put <q>hour</q> for <q>the last time;</q> because it is in the last times that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a> is to come. But some will say, How the last times? How the last hour? Certainly antichrist will first come, and then will come the day of judgment. John perceived these thoughts: lest people should in a manner become secure, and think it was not the last hour because antichrist was to come, he said to them, <q>And as you have heard that antichrist is to come, now are there come many antichrists.</q> Could it have many antichrists, except it were <q>the last hour</q>?</p>
<p>Whom has he called antichrists? He goes on and expounds. <q>Whereby we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that it is the last hour.</q> By what? Because <q>many antichrists have come. They went out from us;</q> see the antichrists! <q>They went out from us:</q> therefore we bewail the loss. Hear the consolation. <q>But they were not of us.</q> All <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, all schismatics went out from us, that is, they go out from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; but they would not go out, if they were of us. Therefore, before they went out they were not of us. If before they went out they were not of us, many are within, are not gone out, but yet are antichrists. We dare to say this: and why, but that each one while he is within may not be an antichrist? For he is about to describe and mark the antichrists, and we shall see them now. And each person ought to question his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, whether he be an antichrist. For antichrist in our tongue means, contrary to Christ. Not, as some take it, that antichrist is to be so called because he is to come <em>ante Christum</em>, before Christ, <em>i.e.</em> Christ to come after him: it does not mean this, neither is it thus written, but <em>Antichristus, i.e.</em> contrary to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Now who is contrary to Christ you already perceive from the apostle's own exposition, and understand that none can go out but antichrists; whereas those who are not contrary to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, can in no wise go out. For he that is not contrary to Christ holds fast in His body, and is counted therewith as a member. The members are never contrary one to another. The entire body consists of all the members. And what says the apostle concerning the agreement of the members? <q>If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and if one member be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, all the members <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co012.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 12:26</font></u></a></span> If then in the glorifying of a member the other members <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it, and in its suffering all the members suffer, the agreement of the members has no antichrist. And there are those who inwardly are in such sort in the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>— seeing His body is yet under cure, and the soundness will not be perfect save in the resurrection of the dead— are in such wise in the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, as bad humors. When these are vomited up, the body is relieved: so too when bad men go out, then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> is relieved. And one says, when the body vomits and casts them out, These humors went out of me, but they were not of me. How were not of me? Were not cut out of my flesh, but oppressed my breast while they were in me.</p>
<p><q><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:19</font></u> They went out from us; but,</q> be not sad, <q>they were not of us.</q> How do you prove this? If they had been of us, they would doubtless have continued with us. Hence therefore you may see, that many who are not of us, receive with us the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sacraments</font></u></a>, receive with us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>. receive with us what the faithful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> they receive, Benediction, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05572c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Eucharist</font></u></a>, and whatever there is in Holy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sacraments</font></u></a>: the communion of the very altar they receive with us, and are not of us. Temptation proves that they are not of us. When <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a> comes to them as if blown by a wind they fly abroad; because they were not grain. But all of them will fly abroad, as we must often tell you, when once the fanning of the Lord's threshing-floor shall begin in the day of judgment. <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; if they had been of us, they would no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> have continued with us.</q> For would you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, beloved, how most certain this saying is, that they who haply have gone out and return, are not antichrists, are not contrary to Christ? Whoso are not antichrists, it cannot be that they should continue without. But of his own will is each either an antichrist or in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Either we are among the members, or among the bad humors. He that changes himself for the better, is in the body, a member: but he that continues in his badness, is a bad humor; and when he is gone out, then they who were oppressed will be relieved. <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> have continued with us: but (they went out), that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</q> That he has added, <q>that they might be made manifest,</q> is, because even when they are within they are not of us; yet they are not manifest, but by going out are made manifest. <q>And you have an unction from the Holy One, that you may be manifest to your own selves.</q> The spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170203.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unction</font></u></a> is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> Himself, of which the Sacrament is in the visible unction.

Just as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> was so called by his proper name, as Elias, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>: so as His proper name our Lord has the name <q>Jesus:</q> but <q>Christ</q> is the name of His sacred character. As when we say, Prophet, as when we say, Priest; so by the name Christ we are given to understand the Anointed, in whom should be the redemption of the whole people. The coming of this Christ was hoped for by the people of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>: and because He came in lowliness, He was not acknowledged; because the stone was small, they stumbled at it and were broken.

At the first, because He came lowly, men stumbled at Him: because He shall come lofty to judgment, on whomsoever He shall come, He will grind him to powder. But not that man will He grind to powder at His future coming, whom He broke not when He came. He that stumbled not at the lowly, shall not dread the lofty. Briefly you have heard it, brethren: he that stumbled not at the lowly, shall not dread the lofty. For to all bad men is Christ a stone of stumbling; whatever Christ says is bitter to them.</p>
<p>For hear and see. Certainly all who go out from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and are cut off from the unity of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, are antichrists; let no man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> it: for the apostle himself has marked them, <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> have continued with us.</q> Therefore, whoso continue not with us, but go out from us, it is manifest that they are antichrists. And how are they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> to be antichrists?

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:22</font></u></a></span> Let us ask the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>: where do you find a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a> that denies that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Christ? See now, my beloved, a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>. Mark what the Lord God may have inspired us withal, and what I would fain work into your minds. Behold, they went out from us, and turned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05121a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Donatists</font></u></a>: we ask them whether Jesus be the Christ; they instantly confess that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Christ. If then that person is an antichrist, who denies that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10212c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, neither can they call us antichrists, nor we them; therefore, neither they went out from us, nor we from them. If then we have not gone out one from another, we are in unity: if we be in unity, what means it that there are two altars in this city? What, that there are divided houses, divided marriages? That there is a common bed, and a divided Christ? He admonishes us, he would have us confess what is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>:— either they went out from us, or we from them. But let it not be imagined that we have gone out from them. For we have the testament of the Lord's inheritance, we recite it, and there we find, <q>I will give You the nations for Your inheritance, and for Your possessions the ends of the earth.</q> We hold fast Christ's inheritance; they hold it not, for they do not communicate with the whole earth, do not communicate with the universal body redeemed by the blood of the Lord. We have the Lord Himself rising from the dead, who presented Himself to be felt by the hands of the doubting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>: and while they yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a>, He said to them, <q>It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> should be preached in His name</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk024.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 24:46-47</font></u></a></span> — Where? Which way? To what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>?— <q>through all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q> Our minds are set at rest concerning the unity of the inheritance! Whoso does not communicate with this inheritance, is gone out.</p>
<p>But let us not be made sad: <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> have continued with us.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:19</font></u></a></span> If then they went out from us, they are antichrists; if they are antichrists, they are liars; if they are liars, they deny that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Christ. Once more we come back to the difficulty of the question. Ask them one by one; they confess that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Christ. The difficulty that hampers us comes of our taking what is said in the Epistle in too narrow a sense. At any rate you see the question; this question puts both us and them to a stand, if it be not understood. Either we are antichrists, or they are antichrists; they call us antichrists, and say that we went out from them; we say the like of them. But now this epistle has marked out the antichrists by this cognizance: <q>Whosoever denies that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10212c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>,</q> that same <q>is an antichrist.</q> Now therefore let us enquire who denies; and let us mark not the tongue, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Christ. Let the tongue keep still for a little while, ask the life. If we shall find this, if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, then assuredly we find many antichrists, who with the mouth profess Christ, and in their manners dissent from Christ. Where find we this in Scripture? Hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> the Apostle; speaking of such, he says, <q>For they confess that they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> deny Him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit001.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 1:16</font></u></a></span> We find these also to be antichrists: whosoever in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> denies Christ, is an antichrist. I listen not to what he says, but I look what life he leads. Works speak, and do we require words? For where is the bad man that does not wish to talk well? But what says the Lord to such? <q>You hypocrites, how can you speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, while you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:34</font></u></a></span> Your voices you bring into my ears: I look into your thoughts. I see an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> will there, and you make a show of false fruits. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what I must gather, and whence; I do not <q>gather figs of thistles,</q> I do not gather <q>grapes of thorns;</q> for <q>every tree is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> by its fruit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:7, 16</font></u></a></span> A more lying antichrist is he who with his mouth professes that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10212c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and with his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> denies Him. A liar in this, that he speaks one thing, and does another.</p>
<p>Now therefore, brethren, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out; but many not yet maninfest, who have not gone out at all.

Now the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Word of God</font></u></a> is Christ: whatever is contrary to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Word of God</font></u></a> is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a> means, <q>contrary to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> And would ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how openly these resist Christ? Sometimes it happens that they do some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and one begins to reprove them; because they dare not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> Christ, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> His ministers by whom they are reproved: but if you show them that you speak Christ's words, not your own, they endeavor all they can to convict you of speaking your own words, not Christ's: if however it is manifest that you speak Christ's words, they go even against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, they begin to find fault with Christ: <q>How,</q> say they, <q>and why did He make us such as we are?</q> Do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> say this every day, when they are convicted of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>? Perverted by a depraved will, they accuse their Maker. Their Maker cries to them from heaven, (for the same made us, who new-made us:) What made I you? I made man, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a>; I made man, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a>; I made man, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a>. You have heard that my works praise me. Out of the mouth of the Three Children, it was the hymn itself that kept them from the fires. The works of the Lord praise the Lord, the heaven, the earth, the sea, praise Him; praise Him all things that are in the heaven, praise Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, praise Him stars, praise Him lights, praise Him whatever swims, whatever flies, whatever walks, whatever creeps; all these praise the Lord. Have you heard there that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a> praises the Lord? Have you heard that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a> praises the Lord? That luxury praises, that frivolity praises Him? Whatever you hear not in that hymn give praise to the Lord, the Lord made not that thing. Correct what you have made, that what God made in you may be saved. But if you will not, and lovest and embracest your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, you are contrary to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Be thou within, be thou without, you are an antichrist; be thou within, be thou without, you are chaff. But why are you not without? Because you have not fallen in with a wind to carry you away.</p>
<p>These things are now manifest, my brethren. Let no man say, I do not worship Christ, but I worship God His Father. <q>Every one that denies the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, has neither the Son nor the Father; and he that confesses the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, has both the Son and the Father.</q> He speaks to you that are grain: and let those who were chaff, hear, and become grain. Let each one, looking well to his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, if he be a lover of the world, be changed; let him become a lover of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, that he be not an antichrist. If one shall tell him that he is an antichrist, he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, he thinks it a wrong done to him; perchance, if he is told by him that strives with him that he is an antichrist, he threatens an action at law. Christ says to him, Be patient; if you have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> spoken of, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with me, because I also am <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> spoken of by the antichrists: but if you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> spoken of, come to an understanding with your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>; and if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> to be called this, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> more to be it.</p>
<p> <q>Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, you also shall abide in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and in the Father. And this is the promise that He has promised us.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:24-25</font></u></a></span> For haply you might ask about the wages, and say, Behold, that which I have heard from the beginning I keep safe in me, I comply therewith; perils, labors, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, for the sake of this continuance, I bear up against them all: with what fruit? What wages? What will He hereafter give me, since in this world I see that I labor among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>? I see not here that there is any rest: mere mortality weighs down the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and the corruptible body presses it down to lower things: but I bear all things, that <q>that which I have heard from the beginning</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/wis009.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Wisdom 9:15</font></u></a></span> may <q>remain</q> in me; and that I may say to my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>Because of the words of Your lips have I kept hard ways.</q> Unto what wages then? Hear, and faint not. If you were fainting in the labors, upon the promised wages be strong. Where is the man that shall work in a vineyard, and shall let slip out of his heart the reward he is to receive? Suppose him to have forgotten, his hands fail. The remembrance of the promised wages makes him persevering in the work: and yet he that promised it is a man who can deceive your expectation. How much more strong ought you to be in God's field, when He that promised is the Truth, Who can neither have any successor, nor die, nor deceive him to whom the promise was made! And what is the promise? Let us see what He has promised. Is it gold which men here <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> much, or silver? Or possessions, for which men lavish gold, however much they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> gold? Or pleasant lands, spacious houses, many slaves, numerous beasts? Not these are the wages, so to say, for which he exhorts us to endure in labor. What are these wages called? <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life.</q> You have heard, and in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> you have cried out: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> that which you have heard, and you are delivered from your labors into the rest of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life. Lo, this is what God promises; <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:34</font></u></a></span> Lo, this what God threatens; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal fire</font></u></a>. What to those set on the right hand? <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:41</font></u></a></span> To those on the left, what? <q>Go into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal fire</font></u></a>, prepared for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</q> Thou dost not yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> that: at least <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> this.</p>
<p>Remember then, my brethren, that Christ has promised us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life: <q>This,</q> says he, <q>is the promise which He has promised us, even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life. These things have I written to you concerning them which seduce you.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:25-26</font></u></a></span> Let none seduce you unto death: desire the promise of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life. What can the world promise? Let it promise what you will, it makes the promise perchance to one that tomorrow shall die. And with what face will you go hence to Him that abides for ever? <q>But a powerful man threatens me, so that I must do some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>.</q> What does he threaten? Prisons, chains, fires, torments, wild beasts: aye, but not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal fire</font></u></a>? Dread that which One Almighty threatens; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> that which One Almighty promises; and all the world becomes vile in our regard, whether it promise or terrify. <q>These things have I written unto you concerning them which seduce you; that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that you have an unction, and the unction which we have received from Him may abide in you.</q> In the unction we have the sacramental sign [of a thing unseen], the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> itself is invisible; the invisible unction is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>; the invisible unction is that charity, which, in whomsoever it be, shall be as a root to him: however burning the sun, he cannot wither. All that is rooted is nourished by the sun's warmth, not withered.</p>
<p><q>And you have no need that any man teach you, because His unction teaches you concerning all things.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:27</font></u></a></span> Then to what purpose is it that <q>we,</q> my brethren, teach you? If <q>His unction teaches you concerning all things,</q> it seems we labor without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>. And what mean we, to cry out as we do? Let us leave you to His unction, and let His unction teach you. But this is putting the question only to myself: I put it also to that same apostle: let him deign to hear a babe that asks of him: to John himself I say, Had those the unction to whom you were speaking? You have said, <q>His unction teaches you concerning all things.</q> To what purpose have you written an Epistle like this? What teaching did <q>you</q> give them? What instruction? What edification? See here now, brethren, see a mighty <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>. The sound of our words strikes the ears, the Master is within. Do not suppose that any man learns ought from man. We can admonish by the sound of our voice; if there be not One within that shall teach, vain is the noise we make. Aye, brethren, have ye a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it? Have ye not all heard this present discourse? And yet how many will go from this place untaught! I, for my part, have spoken to all; but they to whom that Unction within speaks not, they whom the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> within teaches not, those go back untaught. The teachings of the master from without are a sort of aids and admonitions. He that teaches the hearts, has His chair in heaven. Therefore says He also Himself in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>: <q>Call no man your master upon earth; One is your Master, even Christ.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:8-9</font></u></a></span> Let Him therefore Himself speak to you within, when not one of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> is there: for though there be some one at your side, there is none in your heart. Yet let there not be none in your heart: let Christ be in your heart: let His unction be in the heart, lest it be a heart thirsting in the wilderness, and having no fountains to be watered withal. There is then, I say, a Master within that teaches: Christ teaches; His inspiration teaches. Where His inspiration and His unction is not, in vain do words make a noise from without. So are the words, brethren, which we speak from without, as is the husbandman to the tree: from without he works, applies water and diligence of culture; let him from without apply what he will, does he form the apples? Does he clothe the nakedness of the wood with a shady covering of leaves? Does he do any thing like this from within? But whose doing is this? Hear the husbandman, the apostle: both see what we are, and hear the Master within: <q>I have planted, Apollos has watered; but God gave the increase: neither he that plants is any thing, neither he that waters, but He that gives the increase, even God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</font></u></a></span> This then we say to you: whether we plant, or whether we water, by speaking we are not any thing; but He that gives the increase, even God: that is, <q>His unction which teaches you concerning all things.</q></p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>You remember, brethren, that yesterday's lesson was brought to a close at this point, that <q>you have no need that any man teach you, but the unction itself teaches you concerning all things.</q> Now this, as I am sure ye remember, we so expounded to you, that we who from without speak to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170204.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ears</font></u></a>, are as workmen applying culture from without to a tree, but we cannot give the increase nor form the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170204.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fruits</font></u></a>: but only He that created and redeemed and called you, He, dwelling in you by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, must speak to you within, else vain is all our noise of words. Whence does this appear? From this: that while many hear, not all are persuaded of that which is said, but only they to whom God speaks within. Now they to whom He speaks within, are those who give place to Him: and those give place to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, who <q>give not place to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:27</font></u></a></span> For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> wishes to inhabit the hearts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and speak there the things which are able to seduce.

Out of the fabric of the world? Nay, but out of the hearts of the believing. The invader being cast out, let the Redeemer dwell within: because the same redeemed, who created. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> now assaults from without, not conquers Him that has possession within. And he assaults from without, by casting in various <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>: but that person consents not thereto, to whom God speaks within, and the unction of which you have heard.</p>
<p><q>And it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>,</q> namely, this same unction; <em>i.e.</em> the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of the Lord</font></u></a> which teaches men, cannot lie: <q>and is not false. Even as it has taught you, abide ye in the same. And now, little children, abide ye in Him, that when He shall be manifested, we may have boldness in His sight, that we be not put to shame by Him at His coming.</q></p>

For Himself says in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> to them that had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> on Him: <q>If you shall abide in my word, then are you verily my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh008.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 8:3l, 32</font></u></a></span> And, as if they had asked, With what fruit? <q>And,</q> says He, <q>you shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> shall make you free.</q> For as yet our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> is in hope, not in deed: for we do not already possess that which is promised, but we hope for it to come.

For He, the Truth, cannot deceive. Be not a liar, to profess one thing and do another; keep the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and He keeps His promise. But if you keep not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, your own self, not He that promised, has defrauded you.</p>
<p><q>If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that He is righteous, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> ye that every one that does righteousness is born of Him.</q> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1jo002.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 John 2:29</font></u></a></span> The righteousness which at present is ours is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>: and scarce in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, if they be compared with God: yet if there be any perfect righteousness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> and spirits which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has created, it is in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, just, good, by no lapse turned aside, by no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> falling, but remaining ever in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04324b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">contemplation</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Word of God</font></u></a>, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it has begun to be, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, by the Spirit. You heard when the Psalm was read, <q>Begin ye to the Lord in confession.</q> <q>Begin,</q> says it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. You have begun not to defend your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; now have you made a beginning of righteousness: but it shall be perfected in you when to do nothing else shall delight you, when <q>death shall be swallowed up in victory,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:24</font></u></a></span> when there shall be no itching of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, when there shall be no struggling with flesh and blood, when there shall be the palm of victory, the triumph over the enemy; then shall there be perfect righteousness. At present we are still fighting: if we fight we are in the lists; we smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> is alone when he fights against us. If we are with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, we overcome the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: for if you fight alone with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, you will be overcome. He is a skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast us down! That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to your aid against the devices of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. Let Him dwell in you, who cannot be overcome, and you shall securely overcome him who is wont to overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwells not. For, that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it, brethren; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> being in Paradise despised the commandment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his own master, and were loath to be subject to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>: so he fell from that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>, from that blessedness. But there was a certain man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on the dunghill, putrifying with worms, overcame the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: yea, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> had put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, <q>You have spoken as one of the foolish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 2:10</font></u></a></span> There he lent an ear, here he gave an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle: because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> indeed, but not of ourselves. <q>If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that He is righteous,</q> says it, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> ye that every one that does righteousness is born of Him:</q> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. And in that he has said, <q>Is born of Him,</q> he cheers us on. Already therefore, in that we are born of Him, we are perfect. </p></div>

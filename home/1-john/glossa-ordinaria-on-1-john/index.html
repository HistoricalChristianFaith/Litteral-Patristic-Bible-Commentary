Jesus loved most, the son of Zebedee and brother of James, the apostle whom
Herod after the passion of our Lord beheaded, most recently of all the
evangelists wrote a gospel, at the request of the bishops of Asia, against
Cerinthus and other heretics and especially against the then growing dogma of
the Ebionites, who assert that Christ did not exist before Mary. On this
account he was compelled to maintain his divine nativity. But there is said to
be yet another reason for this work, in that, when he had read Matthew, Mark,
and Luke, he approved indeed the substance of the history and declared that the
things they said were true, but that they had given the history of only one
year, the one, that is, which follows the imprisonment of John and in which he
was put to death. So, passing by this year the events of which had been set
forth by these, he related the events of the earlier period before John was
shut up in prison, so that it might be manifest to those who should diligently
read the volumes of the four evangelists. This also takes away the discrepancy
which there seems to be between John and the others. He wrote also one epistle
which begins as follows: That which was from the beginning, that which we have
heard and seen with our eyes and our hands handled concerning the word of life,
which is esteemed of by all men who are interested in the church or in
learning. Of the other two of these the first is: The elder to the elect lady
and her children, and the other: The elder unto Gaius, the beloved, whom I love
in truth, are said to be the work of John the elder, to the memory of whom
another sepulcher is shown at Ephesus to the present day, though some think
that there are two memorials of this same John the evangelist. We shall treat
of this matter in its turn when we come to Papias his disciple. In the
fourteenth year then after Nero, Domitian having raised a second persecution,
he was banished to the island of Patmos and wrote the apocalypse, which Justin
Martyr and Irenaeus interpreted. But after Domitian was put to death and his
acts were annulled by the senate on account of his excessive cruelty, he
returned to Ephesus under Pertinax and, continuing there until the time of the
emperor Trajan, founded and built churches throughout all Asia, and, worn out
by old age, died in the sixty-eighth year after the passion of the Lord and was
buried near the same city. (JEROME,</span><font face="Calibri"> </font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Illustrious Men.  Translation from NICENE AND POST-NICENE

epistle to the commendation of the sermon he introduces the divinity and
humanity of Christ, In it he declares the charity of God for men and his own
charity for those he is writing to.  
John had written his gospel against the teachings of heretics who were
understanding the eternity of the Word badly, and preaching badly. He wrote
also an epistle against the stupidity of these same heretics, in which he
treats the subject of the perfection of faith and charity that we might
understand what we ought to believe, what we ought to love. For many, induced
by perverse doctrines, were not properly understanding the purity of faith and
charity; indeed they were saying that it was works of charity to feast
frequently together, to indulge in excess, to consent to the vices of others,
and they were denying that it was to partake of the sufferings of Christ and
all other things that are accomplished through charity of God and of neighbor.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

All lovers of the world have nothing but these three things, in which all kinds
of vices are included. The concupiscence of the flesh is the longing for all
things that pertain to pleasures and delights of the body, like food, drink,
sexual intercourse, and things of the kind. *The concupiscence of the eyes is
all curiosity that is in learning magical arts, in watching spectacles, in
acquiring unnecessary temporal things, in discerning and criticizing the vices
of your neighbours. The pride of life is when someone boasts about their honors
and seeks to obtain great numbers of slaves. Through these three things was
Adam overcome: because he desired a forbidden food, he wanted to know good and
evil, and he wanted to be like God. These three things Christ has overcome:
because he did not fall in love with the bread of the body. He did not descend
from the pinnacle of the temple because it would be like tempting the strength
of God. He didn't want to be elevated above the realms of the world. (Bede

Son of God in the world for the salvation of the world was done through
charity. Here he announces the salvation of the faithful through the same
charity in the second advent in the day of the judgement. While he commends
love, he neither completely passes the love of God over silence nor names it
frequently. The love of the enemy he completely passes over silence. He
mentions fraternal charity very frequently. Why this? Since he says that it is
no great thing if we love those who love us, if love is not also directed
towards enemies? But he who has attained love of his enemies will not ignore
his brothers. For it has (like a fire) first to seize what is closest, and thus
extend to what is farther. He who wishes his enemy to become his brother, loves
him as a brother. For he does not love in him what he is, but what he wants him
to be. As the craftsman loves the wood cut from the forest of which he is going
to make something: he does not love what it is but what he is going to make.
Therefore he did not instruct too little about charity. In mutual love is the

He is talking of the everyday and light sins which are healed as easily as they
are difficultly avoided. If you have sinned in word, in thought, by
forgetfulness or by ignorance, confess to a brother, as James teaches, ask him
to pray for you (James 5). And if he confesses to you in his turn, intercede
for him too. Here the prayer of the Lord suffices, and mutual confession. It is
a light penitence. Then if the sin is a serious one, bring in the priests of
the church, and chastise yourself after their examination. (Bede Expo. On 1

lives of the male children of Israel at birth, deceived Pharaoh by a lie,
telling him that the women of the Hebrews did not give birth like the women of
the Egyptians; In this connection, it is ordinarily asked whether such lies
have received the sanction of divine authority, since it is written that God
did good to these midwives: but did he forgive their lies, in consideration of
their humanity; Or did he deem it worthy of rewarding this lie himself? This is
not certain. It was one thing to save the lives of the newborn children,
something else to lie to Pharaoh: by saving the lives of these children, the
midwives performed a work of mercy, but in lying to Pharaoh, they acted in
their interest, and for fear of punishment, action worthy perhaps of
forgiveness, but not of praise. Those of whom it is said, "that there is
no lie in their mouths," (Rev. 14:5)<span> 
</span></font><font size="3">do not, it seems to me, in this lie, an example to follow. Those who
lead a life far removed from that of the saints, when they commit these sins of
falsehood, go by themselves by temperament and as they grow older, especially
when instead of raising their sins, hopes towards the heavenly goods, they seek
exclusively the goods of the earth. But those whose life is, according to the
testimony of the Apostle, all heavenly, (Cf. Phil. 3:20) must not regulate on
the example of midwives their manner of speaking, when it comes to telling the
truth and avoid the lie. For the rest, this question deserves to be treated
with particular care, because of the. other examples that Scripture provides.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

RIGHT? — About the action of Moses, for which he killed an Egyptian to defend
his brothers, I have already discussed enough in that work that I wrote against
Faustus about the life of the patriarchs (<i>Cont.
Faustus liv. XXII, ch. 60, et suiv</i></font><font size="3">.). The question is whether the character
of Moses, which impelled him to commit that sin, is worthy of praise, as, for
example, the fertility of the earth is often praised for useful seeds, even if
it also produces useless herbs, or is this act in itself entirely excusable?
The latter does not seem acceptable, because Moses did not yet have any
legitimate authority, nor received from God nor granted by human society.
However, as Stephen says in the Acts of the Apostles, he thought that his
brothers would understand that God was going to give them salvation through him
(Cf. Acts 7:25), so that by this testimony it would seen that Moses could dare
to do this already authorized by God, which the Scripture does not say in this
place. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

not say: open your mouth and I will tell you, but God promises both: I will
open and I will instruct you. In another place in a psalm it is said: Open wide

angered by fury, said, in order not to always repeat the same thing, when the
Scripture speaks of God getting angry, we must warn once and for all how this
can be understood, knowing that God does not do it as a man because of an
irrational disturbance. But we can rightly ask why here God, angered, said
about Moses' brother that he would speak to the people on behalf of Moses. It
seems that, as one who distrusted, he did not give him the total authority that
he was to give him, and that he wanted to do by means of two people what he
could have done by means of one, if that person had faith. However, considering
all these words more closely, does not mean that the Lord, angry, gave Aaron as
punishment. Well, the text says: Do not you have your brother Aaron the Levite?
I know he speaks well. By these words it is shown that God rebuked him rather
than being afraid to appear to the people for being less apt, having as he had
his brother to speak through him to the people what God wanted, since he was weak
in voice and an awkward tongue; although I had to wait for everything from God.
The Lord then repeats the same thing that he had promised shortly before and
after being enraged. He had effectively said: I will open your mouth and
instruct you. And now he says: I will open your mouth and your mouth and I will
instruct you on what you have to do. But as the Lord added: He will speak for
you to the people, it seems that he was granted the opening of his mouth,
because Moses says that he is tongue-tied. About the weakness of the tongue the
Lord did not want to grant anything to Moses. To avoid it, he granted the help
of his brother, who could use the voice that was fitting to teach the people.
In relation to what he says later: And put my words in his mouth shows that the
Lord would give him the words he would say. Because if I only gave them to him
to hear them as the people hear them, he would dictate them in his ear. A
little further on he says: He will speak for you to the people and he will be
your mouth. Here, too, it is understood "for the people". And by
adding: He will speak for you to the people, he sufficiently indicates that
Moses had the authority and Aaron the ministry. Finally, in relation to what he
says: You, on the other hand, will be for him the things that are for God,
perhaps we should see here a great mystery, whose representation Moses has as
an intermediary between God and Aaron, and Aaron as an intermediary between
Moses and the people. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Egypt, and further (Cf. Ex. 18:1-5), that Jethro, his father-in-law, comes to

ask how the truth accords with these two passages. But it must be believed that
Zipporah and her children took the road back to her country, when the Angel
threatened Moses or the child with death. For the feeling of many interpreters,
the Angel put fear in his soul, so that the company of a woman would not be an
obstacle to the mission that Moses had received from God. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

ANGEL WHO COMES TO PUT HIM TO DEATH. — And it happened that on the road, next
to the place where he rested, the angel appeared to him and tried to kill him.
Zipporah then took a stone and circumcised his son's foreskin and fell at the
feet of Moses saying, "The blood of my son's circumcision stopped,"
and the angel turned away from him; therefore, she said: "The blood of the
circumcision ceased." In relation to these words of the Scripture, he asks
himself, first, if it was Moses whom the angel wanted to kill, since it is
said: The angel appeared to him and tried to kill him, and to whom do we
believe that he appeared, but to the one who was in front of all the people and
who led the others? Or if it was the boy he wanted to kill, and the mother
saved him by circumcising him. And in this case, one would have to think that
the angel wanted to kill the child because he was not circumcised, and thus the
precept of circumcision would be sanctioned with the severity of the punishment.
If it is the latter, we do not know of whom it was said before: He tried to
kill him, because, unless it appears in what follows, it is unknown who could
be said before with a certainly rare and unusual expression: he introduced
himself and tried to kill him, because he had not said anything about this
person before. A similar thing happens with the words of the psalm: Its
foundations are on the holy mountains; the Lord loves the gates of Zion (Ps.
87:1-2). The psalm, in fact, begins with those words without saying anything
about that one or the one whose foundations he wanted to speak of, when he
said: Its foundations are on the holy mountains. But as follows: The Lord loves
the gates of Zion, it is concluded that it is the foundations or the Lord or Zion.
And since the easiest sense is that which refers to Zion, the foundations would
be the foundations of the city. Now, as in the pronoun eius (‘its’ foundations)
gender is ambiguous, because this pronoun can be masculine, feminine and
neutral, and in Greek, on the other hand, in feminine it is said αὐτῆς and in
masculine and neutral αὐτου, and the Greek codex has αὐτου, we are forced to
admit that it is not the foundations of Zion, but the foundations of the Lord,
that is, the foundations built by the Lord, of whom it is said: The Lord who
builds Jerusalem. Earlier, when he said: The foundations are on the holy
mountains, he had not mentioned Zion or the Lord. Here, in our text, the same
thing happens: before mentioning the child, he said to himself: He was
introduced and tried to kill him, so that we can know what is next. Although if
someone wanted to understand that text as referring to Moses, there is no
reason to deny it outright. Rather we should understand what follows, if
possible, as if to say that the angel turned away from killing any of them
precisely because the woman said: The blood of the child's circumcision ceased.
He does not really say, "He turned away from him" for having
circumcised the child, but because the blood of the circumcision ceased. Not
because that the blood ran, but because it stopped with great mystery, if I'm
not mistaken. [Augustine of Hippo, Questions on Exodus, PL 34, Question 11] </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

God repeatedly says, I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he gives, so to speak,
the reason for his action: I will harden Pharaoh's heart, said he, "and I
will fulfill my miracles and wonders in Egypt; It seems that the hardening of
Pharaoh's heart is like the indispensable condition for the multiplication or
accomplishment of the wonders of God in Egypt. God knows how to use evil hearts
for the instruction or usefulness of the good. And though the degree of malice
in each heart, or otherwise, the inclination of each to evil, is the result of
a personal vice, resulting from the free choice of the will; yet, in order that
the heart may be inclined to evil in any sense, there are causes which act upon
the mind; the existence of these causes does not depend on man; but they come
from that hidden, assuredly very fair and wise providence by which God rules
and disposes of all that He has created. Thus, that Pharaoh had a heart capable
of finding in the patience of God a devotion, not good but evil, it was in him
a personal vice; but as to the events which determined this heart so depraved
to oppose the orders of God, for that is, strictly speaking, the hardening,
since instead of yielding humbly, Pharaoh resisted with obstinacy, they were a
permission of divine wisdom, which prepared for this heart a chastisement, not
only deserved, but evidently full of justice, and men fearing God would find a
lesson. For example, being offered a reward for the perpetration of a homicide,
the miser and the one who despises fortune will be moved in a different sense;
one will be inclined to commit the crime; the other to defend himself against
it: the proposition of the profit to be withdrawn, however, was not in the
hands of either of them. Thus, for the wicked, there are causes of action which
are not in their power, but which find them already engaged in their own vices,
and as a consequence of an earlier choice of will, and to follow their
inclinations. However, it must be clearly seen whether these words, "I
will harden," cannot mean: I will show how hard his heart is. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

And Aaron cast down his rod. If the Scripture had said, He threw down the rod,
there would be no matter to discuss; but as the word is put, although Moses had
given it to him, it is perhaps not without reason that the text is so
conceived. Would this rod have been common to both of them, so that we could
look at it as belonging to one as well as to the other? </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

rod of Aaron devoured their rods.” If the text had said, The serpent of Aaron
devoured their rods, it was understood that the serpent of Aaron devoured, not
imaginary serpents, but rods. For he was able to devour real rods, not in
appearance without reality. But we read, The rod of Aaron devoured their rods;
But if the serpent could eat the magicians' rods, the rod could not. Instead of
calling the thing from the name of the object to which it has been changed, the
Scripture gives it the name it had before its change, for the reason that it
then returned to its first state; it was proper, moreover, to give the name
which expressed its principal nature. But what do we need to think about the
magicians' rods? Were they also changed into true snakes, and are they called
rods just like Aaron's rod? or rather, by a prestige of magical art, did they
not seem to be what they really were not? Why, then, are both called rods and
serpents, without any distinction, when it is spoken of these illusions? If we
admit that the magicians' rods have been changed into true serpents, a new and
serious difficulty presents itself, for it must be shown that the creation of
these serpents was not the work of magicians or bad angels by whom they operated
their enchantments. Now, among all the corporeal elements of this world are
hidden important reasons, which, by the aid of favorable time and cause, become
definite species, their qualities and ends peculiar to them do not tell the
angels, by whom these beings come to life, that they create animals, no more
than the laborers say they create harvests, trees or any other production of
the earth, because they know how to use visible causes and circumstances
favorable to development. What they do in a visible way, the angels operate in
an invisible way; but God alone is truly creative, he who has deposited in
nature the causes and the seminal reasons. I say all this in a few words; but
to make it better understood and supported by examples and a serious discussion,
it would take a long treaty; the precipitation that presides over this work
will serve me as an excuse. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

So we must assume that the land inhabited by the children of Israel was not
struck by similar wounds: then the enchanters were able to draw water from it,
which they changed into blood, or draw frogs, only to show their magic power.
Nothing prevents us from admitting that they gave themselves up to these evil
spells after the true miracles ceased. The reconciliation of facts, in the
story of Scripture, does not indicate that they have been accomplished
simultaneously.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"And Pharaoh saw that there was a little rest, and his heart dwindled,
and, as the Lord had said, he did not listen to them.” We see here that if
Pharaoh fell into hardening, it was not only because the enchanters did the
same thing as Moses and Aaron; but it was again because of the patience and the
forbearance of God. The divine patience with regard to the heart of man is
useful to some who take advantage of it to repent; useless to others, who abuse
it in order to persevere against God and persevere in evil; but its uselessness
does not come from its nature, but, as we have said, from the depravity of the
heart. This is also what the Apostle says: "Do you not know that the
patience of God invites you to repentance? But by the hardness of your heart
and by your unrepentance, you are gathering up a treasure of wrath for the day
of vengeance and of the manifestation of the just judgment of God, which will
render to each according to his works." (Rom. 2:4-6) And elsewhere, after
having said: "We are everywhere the good odor of Christ," he adds:
"And with regard to those who flee, and to those who are lost." (2
Cor. 11:16) He does not say that he is the good odor of Christ for those who
flee, and the bad for those who get lost: but he says that he is only the good
smell. Now, those who escape, gained by the good odor of Christ, die, as we
have often said, to that disposition of the soul, which must give place in them
to a good will inspired by divine grace; they begin to take advantage of the
judgments of God, which are the misfortune of depraved hearts. From this hymn
issued from a happily transformed heart: "My soul will live and praise
you; and your judgments will support me." (Ps. 118:175) He does not say:
Your benefits, or Your rewards, but your judgments. It is a great deal to be
able to say with sincere confidence: "Test me, Lord, wait on me; burn my
kidneys and my heart.” (Ps. 25:2-3) And in the fear of seeming to ascribe to
his forces anything, he hastens to add: "For your mercy is before my eyes,
and I have delighted in your truth." (Ps. 24;10) He recalls the mercy of
which he has been the object, and which has helped him to behave according to
the truth: that "all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth."

WHY? — “The magicians said to Pharaoh: The finger of God is here.” They said
this because they could not produce the gnats. In relation to this we say that,
indeed, they realized that their attempts to produce the gnats had been in
vain, because they had not been able to make them, even though they knew the
power of their evil arts. But they did not achieve it with such arts. And then
Moses appeared as more powerful in these arts, even though he did it with the
finger of God, which certainly acted through Moses. The finger of God, as the
Gospel very clearly says, is the Holy Spirit. In effect, an evangelist narrates
the words of the Lord: “If I by the finger of God expel demons.” (Luke 11:20)
Another evangelist, describing this very thing, wanted to tell us what the
finger of God is, and he said: “If I, by the Spirit of God, expel the demons.”
(Matt. 12:28) The magicians, in whose power the pharaoh trusted , confessed,
then, that the finger of God was in Moses, who overcame them and frustrated his
enchantments, but nevertheless, Pharaoh's heart then hardened in a truly
extraordinary way. It is difficult to know and explain why the magicians failed
in this third plague, since the plagues began since the water became blood.
They could, therefore, have also failed in the first prodigy, when the rod
became a serpent, and in the first plague, when the water became blood, or in
the second, relative to the frogs, if the finger of God, that is, the Holy
Spirit would have wanted it. Because who would be so foolish to say that the
finger of God could fail with this miracle the attempts of the magicians and
could not with the previous ones? Therefore, there must be a totally certain
cause to explain why they were allowed to do those things up to this moment.
Perhaps the Trinity is insinuated here, and, as it is true, the greatest
philosophers of the Gentiles, as far as can be known from their writings,
philosophized without allude to the Holy Spirit, although they did not omit to
speak of the Father and the Son, a fact that even Didymus remembers in the book
he wrote about the Holy Spirit.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

in each case, we must believe that it happened also in the previous and
subsequent miracles; that is to say, that the earth inhabited by the people of
God was not punished with any of those plagues. It was opportune, however, to
put it here expressly, since similar prodigies began to take place to which the
magicians did not even try to make them. As everywhere in the Kingdom of
Pharaoh there had been gnats, and, on the other hand, there had been no gnats
in the land of Gessen, there is no doubt that they tried to do something similar
to the magicians and they did not succeed. Until they failed, nothing had been
said about the separation of that land. But since these things began to happen,
they did not even dare to do something similar and did not even try.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

ISRAELITES IN THE EYES OF THE EGYPTIANS. — The words of Moses: “It cannot be
so, for we will sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the
Egyptians,” they mean: we are to offer in sacrifice the things that the Egyptians
hate and, therefore, in Egypt we cannot do it. This sense is demonstrated by
the words that follow: “For if we immolated before them what the Egyptians
hate, we would be stoned.” Some of our translators, who did not understand this
passage, translated it like this: It cannot be like that; Shall we sacrifice to
the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians? But in fact the Scripture
has said rather that they will immolate what they abominate. Other Latin
translators say this: It cannot be like that; because the abominations of the
Egyptians we will not immolate them to the Lord our God. The particle of
negation gives the opposite sense, because Moses said: “It cannot be like that;
for we will sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians.”
That's why they said they wanted to go to the desert, where the Egyptians would
not see what they hated. In spite of everything, a mystical sense must be seen
here, as I also said about the shepherds, which were an abomination to the
Egyptians, (Cf. Gen. 46:34) and that is why the Israelites received a separate
land when they went to Egypt. The sacrifices of the Israelites are also an
abomination to the Egyptians, in the same way that the life of the good is for
the bad.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

there he also says this: “If God, willing to show his wrath and show his power,
endured with great patience those who are the object of wrath, forgiving,
evidently, to those whom he had foreseen would be evil and whom he calls
objects prepared for perdition, and to make known the riches of his glory with
the objects of mercy.” (Rom. 9:22-23) Hence the voice of those who were the
object of mercy that appears in the Psalms: “My God, his mercy will help me; my
God will show it to me in my enemies.” (Ps. 58:11-12) God knows how to use well
of the evil ones. But do not believe in them human nature for evil, but endure
them with patience, until he knows that it is convenient. And he does it, not
in vain, but using them to admonish or to exercise the good. Well, may the name

that Pharaoh should hurry to gather his cattle and all that he had in the field
so that he would not perish struck by the hail, when he threatened to send him
a great hailstorm? Actually, this warning seems to be inspired more by mercy
than by anger. But this poses no problem, when God, even when angry, moderates
the penalty. What really poses a problem is knowing what cattle it is now, if
all the animals had died in the previous plague, (Cf. Exod. 9:6) for it is
written that God distinguished the flocks of the Hebrews from those of the Egyptians,
and that the former were totally preserved, while the latter were entirely
destroyed. Can the question be resolved, perhaps, by saying that God had
predicted that those who were in the field would die, understanding that all
those who were in the field would die (Cf. Exod. 9:3) and, instead, those who
were in the houses would be freed, animals that could even be collected and
kept at home by those who feared that what Moses had predicted what the Lord
was going to do would be true? Among these, in turn, could be in the fields
that now advises to be collected in the houses so they do not perish by hail.
And this is what we say above all in what the Scripture refers to: “The
servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord, gathered their cattle in
their houses.” On the other hand, those who did not pay attention to the word
of the Lord, left their cattle in the field. (Exod. 9:20-21) This may have
happened, since God also threatened the death of the cattle, although the
Scripture has omitted it.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Moses: “Speak secretly to the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor,
and every woman of his neighbor, vases of gold and silver, and garments.” No
one should take an example from here to plunder his neighbor in this way. God,
who knew what each one would have to endure, sent this. And the Israelites did
not commit a robbery, but they did a service to God, who had commanded it. This
is like when a judge's minister kills whom he orders to kill. It is clear that
if he does it spontaneously he is a murderer, even though he kills anyone who
knows that he must be killed by the judge. Here is also the question of whether
the Hebrews lived in an isolated place in the land of Gessen, where there were
no plagues that afflicted the people of Pharaoh, how each man asks his neighbor
and each woman his neighbor gold, silver and dresses, especially considering
that the first time this order is given by Moses, it is said: “And each woman
to her neighbor and companion of tent or tabernacle, if it can be said that way
or to the one that coexists with her.” (Exod. 3:22) From this it follows that
neither in the land of Gessen did only the Hebrews live, but that in it they
had as their neighbors some Egyptians, who could also receive those divine
favors for the sake of the Hebrews. And the Egyptians would therefore not only
love these neighbors, but they would easily grant them what they asked for. In
any case, God did not judge that these Egyptians were so oblivious to the
insults and abuse that the people of God had to endure so that they would not
be beaten by this misfortune, they who had not had to suffer those plagues
because God had forgiven that land.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

take a perfect lamb, male and one year old.” This word can draw attention, as
if a lamb could not be a male. And that difficulty is troubling to the one who
does not know why it was translated that way. The literal translation should
have been sheep, because in Greek appears the word <i>próbaton</i></font><font size="3">, which in Greek has neutral gender, and everything that
comes next could fit well, as if the author said: “You will take a perfect
lamb, male and one year old.” In Latin it could be said </font><i><font size="3">masculum pecus</font></i><font size="3"> (male animal), as they say masculature (strong
incense grains), in neutral gender. But </font><i><font size="3">ovis
masculus</font></i><font size="3"> (male sheep) could not be said, because sheep has a female gender.
In the same way it would be an absurdity to say </font><i><font size="3">ovis mascula</font></i><font size="3"> (male sheep). On the other hand, if you put </font><i><font size="3">pecus</font></i><font size="3"> (animal), you would also
understand something else and there would be no mystery, because the Scripture,
when speaking of the sheep, says next: “You will choose between the lambs and
the goats.” By virtue of what has been said, it is rightly thought that Christ
is prefigured in this text. For what need was there to be told to the
Israelites to take the sheep or the lamb from among the lambs and the goats, if
it were not prefigured that whose flesh was not only spread through the
righteous, but also from the sinners? And this despite the Jews trying to
interpret that you can also take a kid to celebrate Easter. And he thinks that
the Scripture said that it could be taken from among the lambs or from among
the goats as if he had said that it is lawful to take either a lamb from among
the lambs or a goat from among the goats, in case they did not have a lamb.
Once things are done, the precept appears in Christ. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the eternal Scripture usually calls a thing, lest it has so solemnly called
eternal something that is not lawful for the Israelites to abandon or change of
their own free will. Because one thing is what is commanded to be done, as the
ark was commanded to circle around the walls of Jericho seven times, (Cf. Jos.

establishing a term for its fulfillment, which may be every day or every month

expression <i>aposkeuén</i>. With this word

there. A Latin translator translated that word for <i>substantia</i> (land) and others also Latin <i>census </i>(goods) and I have put <i>instructus</i>
(equipment), provided that this Latin word designates men and animals and all
herds. What I do not know is if we also have to include women there. The
Scripture mentions six hundred thousand on foot and then adds: “without
counting the equipment or goods or the land or any other word that best
translates to <i>aposkeuén.</i> It is
evident that when mentioning this word must also include men, whether they are

who could carry arms in an army of men. </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
question is often asked whether the Hebrews could have reached such a large
number during the years they were in Egypt, according to the calculation of
them that is deduced from the Scriptures. First of all, it is not a minor
problem to know how many years the Hebrews were there, because, when Abraham
made that sacrifice of a three-year-old cow and a goat and a ram and a
turtledove (Cf. Gen. 15:9) and a dove, before the birth of Isaac and even of
Ishmael, God tells him: “Know that your offspring will be strangers in a strange
land, and they will enslave and oppress you for four hundred years.” (Gen. 15:13)
Now, if we take those four hundred years in the sense that this is the time
when the Hebrews were subjected to the Egyptians, it was not a small space of
time during which the people could have multiplied. But the Scripture clearly
testifies that the Hebrews were not there for so many years.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><span> </span>Some think that it is necessary to count four
hundred and thirty years since Jacob entered Egypt until the town was liberated
from there by Moses, because in the Exodus it is read: “The time that the
children of Israel were as strangers in the land of Egypt and in the country of
Canaan, they and their parents, was four hundred and thirty years.” These
authors think that the years of slavery were four hundred years because of what
Genesis says: “Know that your descendants will be strangers in a strange land
and will enslave and oppress them for four hundred years.” (Gen. 15:13) But as
the years of slavery are counted from the death of Joseph, since during his
life not only were not slaves, but even came to reign, there is no way to
compute the four hundred and thirty years of stay in Egypt. Jacob came in when
his son Joseph was thirty-nine. Because Joseph was thirty years old when he appeared
in Pharaoh's presence (Cf. Gen. 41:46) and began to reign under him. After the
seven years of abundance, in the second year of scarcity, Jacob entered Egypt
with his other children. (Cf. Gen. 45:6) That is why Joseph was thirty-nine
years old at that time, and he died at the age of one hundred and ten years. He
lived, then, in Egypt seventy-one years after the arrival of his father. If we
subtract these seventy-one years from the four hundred and thirty, we will have
the years of slavery, that is, after the death of Joseph not four hundred, but
three hundred and fifty-nine. And if we think that the years should be counted
from the moment that Joseph began to reign under Pharaoh, so we interpret that
Israel in a way entered Egypt at the moment when his son was encumbered there
with such great power, also in this case we will have three hundred and fifty
years. Tychonius says that these three hundred and fifty years can be
considered as four hundred, taking the part for the whole, that is, the part,
fifty years, for the whole, one hundred years. And Tychonius proves that
Scripture often uses this mode of expression. (Rules Book 5)</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But
if we consider that Israel entered Egypt when Joseph, once sold, began to dwell
there, which can be affirmed with some greater probability, we still have to
subtract thirteen years, in this case three hundred and thirty-seven years
instead of four hundred. Well, as the Scripture says that Caath, son of Levi,
grandfather of Moses, entered Egypt (Cf. Gen. 46:11) with his grandfather Jacob
and says, on the other hand, that Caath lived one hundred and thirty years (Cf.
Exod. 6:18) and that his son Amram, father of Moses, lived a hundred
thirty-seven years, (Cf. Exod. 6:20) and says, moreover, that Moses was eighty
years old when he brought the people out of Egypt, (Cf. Exod. 7:7) even though Caath
had fathered Moses' father then, in the year he died, and Amram himself had
also begotten Moses in the last year of his life, added the one hundred and
thirty years and the one hundred thirty-seven and the eighty, we have three
hundred and forty-seven years and not four hundred and thirty. And if anyone
says that Caath, son of Levi, was born in the last year of Joseph's life, you
can add almost seventy years to that amount, because Joseph lived in Egypt
seventy-one years after his father entered that country. Therefore, also in
this way the seventy years of the life of Joseph from the entry of Jacob into
Egypt until the birth of Caath, if it is affirmed that he was born then, and
the one hundred and thirty years of Caath himself and the one hundred
thirty-seven of his son Amram, father of Moses, and the eighty years of Moses
himself make four hundred and seventeen years, and not four hundred and thirty.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
that computation that Eusebius undoubtedly followed in his chronological
history is based on an evident truth. Indeed, Eusebius counts four hundred and
thirty years from the promise that God made to Abraham, by calling him to leave
his land and go to the country of Canaan (Chron. of the World 3260), since also
the Apostle, by praising Abraham and extolling his faith in that promise in the
one that is understood that Christ was prophesied, that is, in the promise that
God made to Abraham that in him all the tribes of the earth would be blessed,
he says: “And I say that a testament confirmed by God is not annulled by a law
made four hundred and thirty years later, so that the promise is annulled.” (Gal.
3:17) The Apostle, therefore, says that the law was promulgated after four
hundred and thirty years from that promise by which Abraham was called and
believed in God, not from the time Jacob entered Egypt. In addition, the Exodus
text itself clearly indicates this. Because it does not say: The time that the
children of Israel lived as strangers in the land of Egypt was four hundred and
thirty years, but it says expressly: “the time they lived in the land of Egypt
and in the land of Canaan, they and their fathers.” Here we see that we must
also count the time of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, since Abraham
began to make a pilgrimage in the country of Canaan, that is, from that promise
according to which the Apostle praises the faith of Abraham until moment when
Israel entered Egypt. During all this time, in fact, the patriarchs made a
pilgrimage through the land of Canaan and then the descendants of Israel went
on a pilgrimage through Egypt. And so the four hundred and thirty years were
completed from the promise until the departure of Israel from Egypt, when the
law was promulgated at Mount Sinai, which does not annul the testament, making
the promises vain.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">As
the Scripture says, Abraham left for the country of Canaan (Cf. Gen. 12:4) at
the age of seventy-five and fathered Isaac at the age of one hundred years. (Cf.
Gen. 21:5) From the promise to the birth of Isaac there are, therefore,
twenty-five years. To these years we must add all of Isaac's life, that is, one
hundred and eighty, (Cf. Gen. 35:25) and thus we reach two hundred and five
years. Jacob was then one hundred and twenty. Because when his father was sixty
he was born the two twins, that is, Jacob and Esau. (Cf. Gen. 25:26) After ten
years, at the age of one hundred and thirty, (Cf. Gen. 47:9) Jacob entered
Egypt. Joseph was then thirty-nine years old. Therefore, from the promise to
the entry of Jacob into Egypt, two hundred and fifteen passed. Joseph,
meanwhile, from the time his father found him in Egypt when he was thirty-nine
years old, lived another seventy-one, and died at the age of one hundred and
ten. Now, if we add these seventy-one to the previous two hundred and five
years, we have two hundred and eighty-six. There remain, then, one hundred
forty-four or one hundred and forty-five years, which would be the years that
the people of Israel would have lived enslaved in Egypt, it is believed, after
the death of Joseph. If we now ask ourselves how much the people could have
multiplied during these years, if we take into account human fertility and the
help of those who wanted them to multiply so much, it does not seem exceptional
that the people left Egypt with 600,000 men on foot, not counting the rest of
the companions, among whom were the slaves, women and those of age not fit for
war.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
what God said to Abraham: “Know that your descendants will be strangers in a
strange land and they will enslave and oppress them for four hundred years,” (Gen.
15:13) it is not necessary to interpret it in the sense that the people of God
were to remain in that very harsh slavery four hundred years. But as the
Scripture says: “In Isaac your descendants will bear your name,” (Gen. 21:12)
from the year of Isaac's birth until the year of his departure from Egypt, four
hundred and five years are counted. If at twenty-four years twenty-five years
are taken away, which are the years that measured between the promise and the
birth of Isaac, it is not strange that the Scripture has spoken of four hundred
years, giving a round number, instead of four hundred and five, because the
Scripture usually alludes to the numbers so that what exceeds a little above or
below the whole number, does not compute it. Therefore, what the Scripture says
about being enslaved and oppressed, we must not refer to the four hundred
years, as if during all that time they had been enslaved. These four hundred
years must be referred to those that are said in another text: “Your offspring
will be a stranger in a strange land.” Indeed, that descendants wandered the
same in the land of Canaan as in Egypt before taking that land as an
inheritance, according to the promise of God. And this last thing happened
after the liberation of the Egyptian captivity. Therefore, we must know that a transposition
exists here and that the order of the words must be: “You must know that your
offspring will be strangers in a strange land for four hundred years.” What
follows is an interleaved phrase: and they will enslave and oppress. In this
way, the interspersed phrase has nothing to do with the four hundred years.
Actually, in the last part of this sum of years, that is, after the death of
Joseph, it happened that the people of God had to endure a hard slavery in
Egypt.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">

faith in Christ and to the blood that redeemed us. This faith must be put
before the works, so that it is in a certain way on the hand against those who
boast in the works of the law. The Apostle speaks and deals with this subject,
because he wants faith to be put before works. And this must be done in such a
way that good works depend on it and are preceded by it, and not in a way that
seems like faith is rewarded by the merits of good works. (Cf. Gal. 3; Heb. 11)

God is mentioned, if in this issue we include the text that says: The finger of
God is here. (Exod. 8:19) The first time is mentioned in the text that says: “The
spirit of God hovered over the waters.” (Gen. 1:2) The second one says: “My
spirit will not remain in these men, because they are flesh.” (Gen. 6:3) The
third when Pharaoh says to Joseph: “Because the spirit of God is in you.” (Gen.
41:38) The fourth when the magicians of Egypt say: “The finger of God is here.”
(Exod. 8:19) The fifth in this song: “You have sent your Spirit, and the sea
has submerged them.” (Exod. 15:8) We remember that the Spirit of God is not
mentioned only to grant benefits, but also to bring punishments. For what else
did he say shortly before when he said: “And by the spirit of your wrath were
the waters parted? (Exod. 15:8) So, this Spirit of God was the spirit of his
wrath against the Egyptians, to whom he destroyed the separation of waters. For
when they entered the waters they were buried by them, when they returned to
their place. On the other hand, for the children of Israel that spirit was not
the spirit of the wrath of God, because to them the separation of waters was of
profit to them. From this it follows that, because of the different actions and
effects, the spirit of God is called in different ways, even though it is one
and the same spirit. And this spirit is also understood as the Holy Spirit in
the unity of the Trinity. Therefore, I think that not another spirit, but the
same is the one indicated by these words of the Apostle: “For you did not receive
a spirit of slaves to return to fear again; but you received a spirit of
adoption with which we cried out: Abba, Father!” (Rom. 8:15) For by that same
spirit of God, that is, by the finger of God, who wrote the law on the tables
of stone, they were instilled with fear. To those who still did not understand
grace, so that the law would convince them of their weakness and their sins,
and the law would become for them their teacher that would lead them to the
grace that resides in the faith of Jesus Christ. (Cf. Gal. 3:22-26) From this
spirit of adoption and of grace, that is to say, of this work of the spirit of
God, through which grace and regeneration is given for eternal life, it is
said: “For the spirit gives life,” when shortly before it was said: “the letter
kills,” (2 Cor. 3:6) that is, the written law that only commands without the
help of grace.</span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

bread in the proper sense, but it gives the name of bread to manna. And it is
not unimportant what is said about the fact that in the afternoon they will be
given meat and in the morning bread. Because a similar thing is also indicated
in the case of Elijah, when a crow brought him food. (Cf. 1 Kgs 17:6) Is it
perhaps symbolized in the flesh in the morning and in the afternoon bread that
was delivered for our crimes and resurrected for our justification? (Rom. 4:25)
He died in the afternoon, because of human weakness was buried, but in the morning
he appeared to the disciples, he who had risen with power.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

GOD. — "And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a vessel of gold, and put it in
this vessel, full of manna, and put it before God, that it may be preserved for
the future races, as God has done ordered." We can ask where Aaron could
put it before God, if there was no image there or the ark of the covenant was
still built. Did you say maybe in the future you will place it so that it would
be understood that it would be placed before God when the ark was there? Or was
it rather said before God because it is done by the offeror's own devotion, no
matter where it was placed? Because where is God not? But what the author adds
next: “And Aaron placed before the testimony to be preserved,” seems to confirm
the first sense. For then Scripture says in anticipation what was realized in

Israel ate the manna for forty years, until they came to the inhabited earth.
They ate the manna until they reached the territory of Phoenicia.” The
Scripture indicates by means of a sequel, that is, remembering in this passage
what was also realized later, that the children of Israel did not eat in the
wilderness more than manna. This is what the phrase means: until the inhabited
earth, that is to say, the land that is no longer desert, not because
immediately they arrived at the habitable land they stopped eating the manna,
but because they did not leave it before. It is indicated, then, that the manna
ceased once passed the Jordan, where they ate the bread of the earth.
Therefore, when they came to the habitable land, before passing the Jordan,
they were able to eat only manna or manna and other food. The text, in fact,
can be understood thus, since it is not said that the manna ceased until after
passing the Jordan. But there is a serious problem of knowing why, in the midst
of that desert shortage, they also wanted to eat meat, since they left Egypt
with their abundant flocks. Unless it is said that, as in the desert there were
not so many pastures and therefore it would seem that the fertility of the
cattle would be less, they reserved their cattle, lest all the animals lacking,
they should also lack the necessary ones for the sacrifices. Could we not, for
the solution of this difficulty, find some other explanation? It is believed,
with more reason, that they did not desire the meats which their flocks could
have procured for them, but those which they lacked, that is to say the meat of
fish, for they found none in that wilderness, wherefore God sent them rattles;
most Latin translators say quails, though these birds, though not very
different, are of different species. God knew what was the object of their
desires and the kind of meat that could satisfy them. But the Scripture having
said that they desired meat, without observing what kind of meat they claimed,
we had to treat this question.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Before he had said: Until they reached the inhabited earth. But since he had
not specified what land it was, now it seems that he says it more expressly
when he adds: “to the territory of Phoenicia.” But it is convenient to remember
that that land was called like that then, but not now. In fact, what is called Phoenicia,
region of Tyre and Sidon, is another. And it is not said that the Israelites
have crossed it. Although it is possible that the Scripture may call Phoenicia
land to the place where palm trees had already begun to appear after the
desolation of the desert, because in Greek palm it is said that way. At the
beginning of their trip they found a place where there were seventy palm trees
and twelve fountains. Then they were welcomed by the immensity of the desert,
where there was none of that, until they reached cultivated places. But the
most likely interpretation is to think that the earth was then called that way.

this expression. Does Moses attribute more to what Aaron did, because God
commanded through Moses what Aaron had to do, and in Moses was authority and in

that the law of God is eternal and that all pious minds take it into
consideration to make or command or forbid what they find in it, according to
what that law prescribes with immutable truth. Is it necessary to think that
Moses, although God spoke with him, used to consult God all the things that
arose in the litigation of such a large crowd and that he dedicated himself all

MOSES. — In relation to the advice that Jethro gives his son-in-law Moses not
to exhaust himself in such an unacceptable way, the same as the people, dealing
only with the judgments of the same, the first question that arises is to know
how it is possible that God let a foreigner advise this to Moses, who was a
servant of God, with whom he spoke so many such things. With this data the
Scripture teaches us that we should not despise anyone, whoever the person who
gives us advice according to the truth. We must also think that perhaps God
wanted to admonish Moses by means of a foreigner in a matter in which arrogance
could have tempted him, because Moses alone judged all the people who were
waiting for him standing with all their highest judicial authority. This
interpretation is suggested by the fact that Jethro advised him to choose to
judge the disputes of the people to those who were free from arrogance. (Cf. Exod.
18:21) For the rest, this text clearly demonstrates the great attention that
must be paid to what the Scripture says in another passage: “Son, do not get
involved in multiple issues.” (Eccles. 11:10) Finally, it is convenient to
meditate the words that Jethro says to Moses to advise him; for he says to him:
“So now listen to me, and I will give you some advice, and God will be with
you.” It seems to me that here it is indicated that a mind too attentive to
human acts is empty of God in a certain way, and is filled with it further the
more freely it tends to higher and eternal things.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

MOSES. — Then he adds: “Be the representative of the people in the things that
refer to God and you will bring his words before him; and you will teach them
the precepts of God and his law, and you will make known to them the path they
must follow and the works that they must do.” These words show that Moses must
act like this with all the people. The text does not say: take before God the
words of each one; but his words, because he had said before: “Be the
representative of the people in the things that refer to God.” Then he advises
him that the concrete issues that arise between them are taken care of
naturally by a select and capable men, God fearing and just and enemies of
arrogance, whom he must put at the head of the community, some as chiefs of a thousand,
others as heads of a hundred, others as heads of fifty and others as heads of
ten. In this way he took from Moses a heavy and dangerous occupation and did
not tax these men, since a thousand men would have one as their leader, and
under him there would be another ten and under them another twenty and under
them another hundred, so that hardly any problem would arrive to each one of
these leaders that it was necessary to judge him. The example of humility is
also suggested here, since Moses, with whom God spoke, did not mislead or
despise the advice of his father-in-law, who was a foreigner. And we can
rightly ask, and I believe that is the most proven, if Jethro, though not an
Israelite, has to be counted among the worshipers of the true God and religious
men, like Job, who was not an Israelite either. Indeed, the ambiguous words are
that he offered sacrifices to the true God in his people, when he saw his
son-in-law, or that Moses himself worshiped him. As regards to adoration,
although the Scripture has expressly said it, it would be an honor given to his
father-in-law, as patriarchs tend to give men to honor them. On the other hand,
it is not easy to know who are the <i>grammatoeisagogeis</i></font><font size="3">,
who come after the heads of ten, (Cf. Exod. 18:21) because that word is not
used in any case to designate offices or magistracies. Some translate it by
"doctors", referring to doctors of letters, those who teach one the
knowledge of the same, as the Greek word literally sounds. Here, evidently, it
is pointed out that the Hebrews knew the alphabet before receiving the law. But
I do not know if it's worth investigating when they met him. Some claim that
they knew him from the beginning of humanity and that through those primitive
men he came to Noah and then to Abraham's parents and then to the people of
Israel; but I do not know how you could try this.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

PASSOVER AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE LAW. — "On the third day of the third
month since the coming out of Egypt, the children of Israel came to the
wilderness of Sinai; they had departed from Raphidin, and having arrived at the
desert of Sinai, Israel encamped at the foot of the mountain; And Moses went up
to the mountain of God, and the Lord called him out of the mountain, and said
to him, This shall you speak to the children of Israel, etc.” Then, a little
later, he adds: “Go down and give witness to the people and purify them today
and tomorrow, and wash their clothes and be ready for the third day; for on the
third day the Lord will come down to Mount Sinai before all the people.” On
this day the law was promulgated, written by the finger of God on stone
tablets, (Exod. 31:18) as the text says below; it is the third day of the third
month since Israel left Egypt. So, from the day they celebrated the Passover,
that is, since they slaughtered the lamb and ate it, which was the fourteenth
day of the first month, until this month when the law is enacted, fifty days
pass: seventeen days of the first month (Cf. Exod. 12:6) and the rest from day
fourteen; afterwards all the thirty days of the second month, which together amount
to forty-seven, and three days of the third month, which is the fiftieth day
since the solemnity of the immolation of the lamb. Therefore, as in this shadow
of the future, according to the feast of the immaculate lamb, the law written
by the finger of God was promulgated after fifty days, so also in the truth of
the New Testament, since the feast of the immaculate lamb Jesus Christ, there
is fifty days, after which the Holy Spirit was given to us from the heavens. (Cf.

71.</font></span></b></a><span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> DIVISION OF PRECEPTS OF THE
DECALOGUE. — </span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">We
can find out how the ten commandments of the law are to be distributed: if
there are four to the commandment of the Sabbath, referring to God, and then
the remaining six, beginning with the first that says: “Honor your father and
mother,” (Exod. 20:12) referred to man; or if, on the contrary, those first
would be three, and the rest would be seven. Those who hold that the first four
form a block, do the division starting with the words: “You will not have other
gods besides me.” And the next commandment would begin with: “You will not make
idols”, etc., (Exod. 20:3-4) where the worship of idols is forbidden. And they
say that it is a single commandment represented by the following words: “You
shall not desire your neighbor's wife, you shall not desire your neighbor's
house, (Exod. 20:17) and everything else to the end. On the other hand, those
who maintain that the first three form a block and the last seven, another,
affirm that it constitutes a single commandment everything related to the
worship of one God, where the worship of another God outside it is excluded.
And the last commandment is divided into two. The first would be: “You will not
desire your neighbor's wife,” and the other: “You will not desire your
neighbor's house.” But that the commandments are ten nobody denies, since the
Scripture affirms it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">
<br /></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">I,
on the other hand, find it more consistent to take, on the one hand, those
three, and on the other, these seven, because those who consider it with more
attention seem to them that the three relative to God also insinuate the
Trinity. Actually, the words: “You will not have other gods besides me,” they
explain this more clearly, by forbidding the worship of idols. On the other
hand, the desire of the woman of the neighbor and the desire of the foreign
house only differ in the way of sin, because to whom the Scripture says: You
will not desire the house of your neighbor,” the own Scripture adds to him: “Neither
its field, neither his servant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass,
nor any of his cattle or anything that belongs to your neighbor. (Exod. 20:17)
Therefore, it seems that the Scripture distinguishes between the desire of
another's wife and the desire for anything else, since both prohibitions begin
like this: You will not desire your neighbor's wife; you will not desire your
neighbor's house, and the remaining two were added to these two prohibitions.
By saying: You will not want your neighbor's wife, the text did not add the
rest: neither his house, nor his field nor his servant, etc.; but things that
seem to be enclosed in a single commandment and separated from that in which
the woman is mentioned appear absolutely united. On the other hand, the precept
that says: “You will not have other gods outside of me,” it seems that it is
better done in the things that are added to it. Because what do they mean but
to the precept: “You will not have other gods besides me,” the words that
follow: “You will not make any idol or any image, or of what is above in heaven
or what is below on earth nor of what is in the water below the earth. (Exod.
20:4-5) You will not worship them or worship them.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">
<br /></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">For
the rest, there is also a problem in knowing how the precept is different: “You
will not steal” (Exod. 20:15) of what shortly after it is ordered about not
wanting the things of one's neighbor. Obviously, not everyone who wants the
things of others steals. But if everyone who steals wants the things of his
neighbor, it could also have included the theft of that general precept, which
forbids the desire of the things of one's neighbor. There is also the question
of knowing how the precept of not committing adultery is different (Exod. 20:15)
from the one mentioned a little later: “You will not want your neighbor's wife.”
Because in the precept: “You will not commit adultery,” that other could also
have been included. Unless in the two precepts relating to adultery and theft
the acts have been prohibited, and in these other two, however, the desire. And
these are things so different from each other that sometimes commits adultery
who does not want the woman of the neighbor, if you have relations with her for
another different reason, and sometimes you can wish without having relations
with her for fear of punishment. And because of that, the law may have meant
that both are sins. </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">
<br /></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
question of knowing whether the word <i>moechia</i>
(adultery) also includes fornication is also often raised. <i>Moechia </i>is a Greek word that the Scripture already uses in Latin.
But in Greek, only adulterers are called <i>mochios</i>.
Naturally, this law has not been given only for men, but also for women. In
fact, because the Scripture says: “You will not want your neighbor's wife,” the
woman does not have to think that nothing is forbidden here, and therefore,
that she can lawfully desire the husband of her neighbor. Therefore, if what is
said here to man it follows that the precept also includes women, although not
expressly stated, how much more should refer to both sexes the precept on the
prohibition of adultery, when the precept itself can refer without difficulty
to both; the same as the commandments: Thou shalt not kill; you will not steal,
(Exod. 20:13,15) and other similar ones that did not expressly refer to one sex
would apply to both sexes equally. But when a single genre is expressed, then
the noblest one is expressed, that is, the masculine gender, so that through it
the woman also understands what is commanded. And so, if the married woman is
an adulteress having sex with a man other than her husband, even if he is not
married, the married man who has sex with a woman other than his wife is
obviously also an adulterer, even if she is not married.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">

here is a question that is worth asking: Is a man who is not married and a
woman who is not married, having been together, both transgress this command?
If they do not transgress it, the Decalogue contains no defense against
fornication, but only against adultery, though, according to the language of
Scripture, all adultery is fornication. Does not the Lord say, in the Gospel,
"Whosoever shall send away his wife, except for fornication, causes her to
fall into adultery?" (Matt. 5:32)</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">
<br /></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Here
is called fornication to the sexual relationship between a married woman and a
man who is not her husband, an act that is a <i>moechia</i>, that is, an adultery. Therefore, in the Scriptures, all <i>moechia</i> is also a fornication. But that
all fornication can also be a <i>moechi</i>a,
for the moment I find no example that endorses it in the Scriptures. Now, if
not all fornication can also be <i>moechia</i>,
I do not know in what precept of the Decalogue that fornication committed by
unmarried men with unmarried women can be forbidden. And if it is properly
called theft to any illicit usurpation of an alien thing, for it does not allow
the robber who forbade the theft, but who wanted to explain everything on the
part, everything that is illegally stolen from the things of one's neighbor is.
It is evident that, under the name of <i>moechia</i>,
all illicit sexual intercourse and the non-legitimate use of those members must
be considered prohibited.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">

relation to the precept: “You will not say false testimony against your

injunction be directed against those who say that it is lawful to lie when the
lie takes advantage of someone and does not harm the one to whom lies are told.
Because that lie would not go against your neighbor. And so it would seem that
the Scripture would have added that, when it could have said more briefly: “You
will not say false testimony,” as it said before: “Thou shalt not kill; you
will not commit adultery; you will not steal.” But here a serious problem
arises, which cannot easily be solved by those in a hurry, like me, and it is

the people saw the voice and the lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the
mountain fuming.” It is often asked how the people could see the voice, when
the voice does not seem to belong to the sense of sight, but to the ear. But,
just as I just said <i>videatur</i> (it
seems), applying this word to all the things I said, so <i>videre</i> (see) is usually used in a general sense, not only to refer
to the corporal things, but also to the spiritual ones. A similar thing happens
with the phrase: “Seeing Jacob that there was food in Egypt,” (Gen. 42:1) when
in fact he was not in Egypt. Some believe that "seeing" the voice
means nothing more than "understanding", an act that is the vision of
the mind. Well, as the author wanted to say briefly here the people saw the
voice and the lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain that was
smoking, there would be an even bigger problem if we wanted to know how the
lightning and the mountain were heard, fuming, things that belong to the sense
of sight. The problem is solved by saying that the author did not have to say
it so briefly to cover everything: he heard the voice and saw the lightning and
heard the sound of the trumpet and saw the mountain fuming. There were, then,
two kinds of voices: those coming from the clouds, like thunder, and that
coming from the trumpet, if it is really called voice to the sound that came
from the clouds. And so, in the things referring to the sense of hearing, the
author alludes to the general sense, that is, the sense of sight, wanting the
Scripture to briefly cover the whole, better than in the things that refer to
the sense of sight it would have understood the sense of hearing, because we do
not usually talk in that way. In effect, we usually say: “look how it sounds,”
and we do not say: “hear how it shines.”</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">

name, he will give her a reward. But the master will not be able to sell her to
foreign people, because he despised her. If he marries her to his son, he will
treat her as it is fair to treat girls. And if he takes another for his son, he
will not refuse to give her upkeep, clothing and cohabitation. If he did not do
these three things, she will go free without a payoff.” This passage is
rendered so obscure by the use of unusual terms and constructions, which our
commentators scarcely know how to explain their meaning. This place is not
easier to understand in Greek. I will try to say what I see there. </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
first sentence: “If anyone has sold his daughter as a slave,” <span> </span>that is, to be a slave, a person the Greeks
call <i>oikéten</i>, “she shall not go out
as the female slaves do,” (Exod. 21:7) meaning the following: she will not
leave as the Hebrew female slaves after six years, because we must think that
also for the Hebrew woman has been given the law that applies to males. Why,
then, should this woman not leave like this but because it is understood that
she has been humiliated during her slavery, having had sexual relations with
her master? This is clarified in some way by what is said below. The text, in
effect, continues saying: “But if she does not please her master, who has not
given her his name him,” that is to say, he did not make her his wife, he will compensate
her.” (Exod. 21:8) This is equivalent to what was said before: “She will not go
as the female slaves do.” It is just and right to receive something for the
fact of having been humiliated, since the master did not have sexual relations
with her to make her his wife, to give her his name. The phrase: “He will compensate
her,” other translators translate it by: “He will rescue her,” which if in
Greek it had been said <i>apolutrósetai</i>
would have been written as it is written in the psalm: “And he will rescue
Israel,” (Ps. 129:8) because there the verb <i>apolutrósetai</i>
appears. But in this passage we read: <i>apolutrósei</i>
which means that more is received than what is given for it to be rescued. To
whom will his master give something to rescue the one he owns as a slave? But
the gentleman will not be able to sell her to foreign people, because he made
contempt in it, that is to say, not because the gentleman made contempt in it
for that reason he will be able to sell her, that is, he will dominate her as
long as he can sell her lawfully even to foreign people. For the rest, she
"despised her" (<i>sprevit in ea</i>)
is equivalent to "despised her" (<i>sprevit
eam</i>), and "despised her" is equivalent to "humiliated
her", that is, he had sexual relations with her without making her his
wife. The Greek says <i>ezétesen</i>, a word
that we translate by <i>sprevit</i>
(contempt). The Scripture uses this word in Jeremiah: “As a woman despises (<i>spernit</i>) the one with whom she has
sexual relations.” (Jer. 3:20)</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Then
he continues saying the text: “And if he gives the name of his son, he will
treat her as the daughters are treated.” Here it is already beginning to be
understood why it was said before: “to the one who had not given his name,”
because what does it mean: if he gives the name of his son, but: “he gives her
as a wife to his son?” And when he says: “He will treat her as he treats her
daughters,” it means "that he should give her as a wife as a daughter is
given", that is, by giving her a settlement. Then he adds: “And if he
takes another woman for him,” that is, he does not destine her as a woman for
his son, but seeks another, he will not disappoint the first things necessary,
neither the dress nor the treatment. She must give him the things she is
entitled to in the same way, because she did not continue being the wife of her
son, as she would give them, if she had not given her name and, nevertheless,
humiliated her, having sexual relations with her. What I have translated by
treatment, corresponds in Greek to <i>omilian</i>,
that is to say, "discourse", a word that the Scripture usually uses
to designate more indirectly sexual relations. And what does it mean: "he will
not disappoint her with sexual relations" but "will give a reward for
the sexual relations?” For according to the book of Daniel the elders who gave
false testimony against Susanna, said: “A young man who was hiding approached
her, and went to bed with her.” (Dan. 13:37) And Daniel, asking about this same
thing, says: "Under what tree did you see them talking together?" (Dan.
13:58) They had said: “He slept with her.” Then, refuting the arguments of the
other and trying to convince him, Daniel says: “Race of Canaan and not of
Judah, beauty has delighted you and concupiscence has perverted your heart! So
you did the daughters of Israel and they, out of fear, gave themselves to you.”
(Dan. 13:56-57) The Greek text says: <i>omílousan
imin</i>. Literally translated into Latin you could say <i>loquebantur vobis</i> (they spoke with you), and with that expression
the union of bodies is indicated. Where the Latin says: “Under what tree did
you surprised them” (<i>comprehendisti</i>),
the Greek has already: "you surprised them while talking among
themselves". And with that phrase sexual relations is also indicated. </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In
relation to this person in question, the Scripture adds the following: “If I
did not give you these three things, she will leave free.” (Exod. 21:11) These
words mean that if he did not humiliate her with sexual relaitons, nor gave her
as a wife to his son, nor does another woman married to her son throw her out
of the house, she will go free, that is, it will be enough for her not to
continue being a slave. She will leave, therefore, without receiving anything,
like the Hebrew slave. For her master is not allowed to marry a non-Hebrew man
whom he cannot give to foreign people. But if he gave her up to marry a Hebrew
slave, it is naturally understood that the woman who is not separated from her
husband will leave with him for free.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

the case that one is killed by another without wanting it. And because only God
has done it, it is said: “But God gave him into his hands.” When one kills
voluntarily, he kills him and God hands him over to him. There is, then, this
difference, which in that case, only God has done; in this, on the other hand,
God and man do it by the will of the one who does it. But man does not do it
like God. God only does it with justice; Man, on the other hand, is worthy of
punishment in doing so; not because he killed who God would not want to kill
himself, but in attention to iniquity. For he did not lend aid to God who
commanded him, but served his evil desire. So, in the same and only fact, not
only is God praised for his hidden justice, but man is also punished for his own

child is born, the guilty party will be fined according to what the husband of
the wife imposes, and he will give it to him by petition.” It seems to me that
these things are said because of some special meaning and not because the
Scripture deals with facts of this nature. Because if the Scripture pretended
that a pregnant woman, who had been beaten, should not be forced to abort,
would not put two men to quarrel, since a single man could cause it if he
quarreled with the woman, or even if he did not quarrel, if he did that same
wanting to cause damage to the offspring of another. Well, the fact that the
author did not want the unborn childbirth to belong to the homicide proves that
he thought that it was not man that is carried in the mother's womb. Here the
problem of the soul is usually posed, that is, if what is not formed cannot be
said to be animated, and therefore, that it would not be a homicide, since it
cannot be affirmed that a being that had not yet had soul.</span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this last phrase mean but "he himself will die"? Because the law
imposes this in the other cases mentioned with this motive: eye for eye, tooth
for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise
for bruising,” (Exod. 21:24-25) that is, the justice of retaliation. And this
law was established to show what kind of punishment should be applied. Because
if it were not known by law what kind of punishment had to be applied, where
would we know what punishment would remove the forgiveness to be able to say: “Forgive
us our debts just as we forgive our debtors?” (Matt. 6:12) The law, in effect,
reveals the debtors, so that when something is forgiven, it appears what is
forgiven. For we would not forgive the debts if we did not know by law what is
owed to us. Therefore, if that birth had already exists, but was still somehow
animated without form, because the great problem of the soul does not have to
be resolved hastily with the recklessness of an uncontested sentence, the law
has not wanted it to be a homicide, because it still cannot be called a living
soul that is in a body that lacks senses, if it is thus in a flesh not formed
and therefore not yet endowed with senses. It is not easy to understand what is
said next: “And he will pay on his request" compensation that the husband

If he not said at the trial, a serious problem would arise. But, in any case,
it would have to be understood, even if it had not been said. Earlier he had
said: Do not let yourself be carried away by the crowd, by the majority, to
divert the judgment.” (Exod. 23:2) Therefore, the sentence: “You will not have
compassion for the poor,” it could be understood in the trial. But as those
words have been added, there is no problem that this has been done. Do not be,
then, that, in judging, we see that justice is in favor of the rich against the
poor and we seem to work well if we favor the poor, moved by mercy, against
justice. Mercy is certainly good, but it should not go against judgment.
Scripture, of course, calls judgment on what is just. But so that no one thinks
that because of this sentence God forbids mercy, the following will come very
opportunely: “If you find the ox of your enemy or his ass lost, you will return
them, (Exod. 23:4) so that you know that you have not been forbidden to practice
mercy. Practice it even with your enemies, even outside of judgment. For when
you return the errant ox of your enemy and restore it to him, do not feel like

THE SEVENTH YEAR. — "You will sow your land for six years, and you will
gather the fruits; but you shall break loose the seventh year, and you shall
rest; and the poor of your people will have food: what they will leave, the
wild beasts will eat. You will do the same for your vine and your olive plant."
We can ask what the poor picked up, if the seventh year was left to rest on the
earth to the point that it was not even sown, for it does not refer to the
vineyard or the olive grove what is said before: “The poor of your people will
eat, because from a land not sown, nothing can be collected, because the
harvest cannot be born. Then he says that we must do the same with the vineyard
and with the olive grove. This is why we understand what is said about the
fields that are used for wheat. Or the phrase that: "You will sow your
land for six years, and you will gather the fruits” you have to understand it
in the sense that you will sow and gather for six years, and the seventh you
will not gather, but you will "sow", although it is not expressly
stated. In this case, for six years they would sow and gather, and the seventh,
on the contrary, they should leave what they had sown. Because what could the
poor get out of there, when the remains are left for the animals of the field,
those animals that could eat those fruits, like wild boars and deer and the
like? This, in any case, would not be said if it did not have some meaning. For
if God does not care about oxen, (1 Cor. 9:9) referring to the commandments
that God gave to men, a claim that should not be understood in the sense that
God does not give food to those who neither sow nor reap or gather in the barn,
(Matt. 6:26) but rather God does not care to give man a precept about how he should
care for his ox, how much less does God care to give a precept about the way in
which man cares for country animals, when God himself feeds them? with the
goods of exuberantly productive nature, who also feeds them during the other
six years when the things that are sown are collected!</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

HIS MOTHER'S MILK. — I do not know how the literal meaning of the words could
be found: “You will not boil the lamb in its mother's milk.” If we accept that
it is forbidden to cook the lamb in milk for any reason, I must say that there
is no custom of cooking it in this way. But if it is the time of breastfeeding,
what Jew never observed this custom of not cooking the lamb unless he had
stopped breastfeeding? And what does it mean: in your mother's milk? It gives
the impression that it could be cooked without transgressing the aforementioned
precept, in case it should be understood this way, if at the birth of the lamb,
his mother had died and had been breast-fed by another sheep, when in reality
nobody doubts that this precept obeys, <span> </span></font><font size="3">obviously, to some special meaning. But it is
worth remembering that even those things that can be done and observed, are guided
in that way for some reason, because they have some meaning. But either it does
not occur or it does not appear clear how this precept can be observed
literally.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">If
we understand Christ, then I think that with this prophecy it was predicted
that the Jews should not kill the child, when Herod looked for him to kill him
and could not find him. (Cf. Matt. 2:13-15) And so the expression boil refers
to the fire of passion, to tribulation, which is why the Scripture says: “The
oven proves the potter's vessels, and the righteous men, the temptation of the
tribulation.” (Sirach. 27:6) The fact that the child did not suffer the passion
when Herod looked for him and when it seemed that this danger threatened, was
predicted with these words: You will not cook the lamb in the milk of its
mother: "you will not kill Christ". It seems to be a premonitory
prophecy for the good Israelites not to associate with the bad Jews, who made
Christ suffer the Passion. Indeed, the tribulation of passion is like fire.
That is why the Scripture says: “As gold in the crucible he tasted them and as
a burnt offering, as a host they received them.” (Wis. 3:6) The Lord also
confirms this sentence when he says: “I have to be baptized with a baptism that
you do not know.” (Luke 12:49-50) It says so, when in another place he had
said: “I have come to bring fire to the world.” And John says: “He will baptize
you in the Holy Spirit and in the fire. (Matt. 3:11; Luke 3:16; Cf. Jn. 1:33)
And this means that he will do it with purification and with the trial of
tribulation. He also meant the same fire when he was led to the passion, when
he told those who were crying for him that they should cry rather for
themselves. And he finished with these words: “For if they do this when the
wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?" (Luke 23:31) The good
ones, therefore, receive the advice not to participate with the wicked in the
crucifixion of Christ, who received the name of Lamb of God who takes away the
sins of the world. (Jn. 1:29) Therefore, you will not cook the lamb in your
mother's milk. You will not apply to Christ the fire of passion on the day he
was conceived. Because it is said that he also suffered then, that is, the
twenty-fifth of March. From that day until the twenty-fifth of December in
which his birth is placed, there are nine months, with the tenth started. The
breasts of women collect milk from the day of conception. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">There
is, however, another easier interpretation. “You will not boil the lamb in the
milk of its mother,” that is, to the one who is still a small and lactating
child, individuals to whom the Apostle says: “I gave you milk, not solid food,”
(1 Cor. 3:2) you will not send them to the passion too soon. It is as if it
were said to Christ, who spared suffering to his disciples, who were still like
children, offering himself to death for them, when he said: “Then, if you seek
me, let them go.” (Jn. 18:8) And so that it would be understood that they were
still weak and unfit for the passion, like lambs in their mother's milk, the
evangelist goes on saying: “I did not lose any of those you gave me.” Where it
appears that those who suffered then would die; for then they did not suffer
what they suffered afterwards, no longer as lambs in milk, but as rams in the
flock.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Perhaps
it is not absurd either what others say, that the prophet ordered the good
Israelites not to join the bad Jews who made the passion suffer to Christ, as a
lamb in the milk of his mother, that is, in the time when he was conceived.
Well, it is said that women collect milk from the moment they conceive. Now,
that Christ was conceived and suffered in that month, it is demonstrated not
only by the Feast of the Passover, but also by the day of his birth known in
the churches. For who was born the ninth month, around the twenty-fifth day of
December, was evidently conceived the first month, around the twenty-fifth of
March, which was also the time of his passion in the milk of his mother, that
is, in time of his mother's milk.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

spiritual sense, when understood as referring to the temporal happiness of men,
they are typical of the Old Testament. In him there are precepts relative to
the good customs. Others mean something mysterious. But the promises are
fleshly and earthy. Thus, in the seventy-second Psalm, the man of God says that
his footsteps were almost lost and slipped, (Cf. Ps. 7:2) jealous for sinners,
seeing the peace they enjoy. He saw that the wicked disposed abundantly of the
things that, according to the Old Testament, he expected of the Lord God, whom
he served for that reward. And, because of this, the impious idea that God did
not care about human affairs began to infiltrate him, he says that he changed
his mind, not daring to reject the authority of the saints, and he began to
reflect to understand it and said: “It is a task that I have before me, until I
enter the sanctuary of God and understand its end. (Ps. 72:16-17) There the
prizes corresponding to the New Testament will be given, which the impious will
not receive. And then the sorrows of the wicked will take place, while the
righteous will be free of them.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

problem arises of knowing what is to be understood under these hornets. Because
God promises this, and the book of Wisdom says that it was fulfilled when he
affirms: “And he sent hornets as forerunners of his army.” (Wis. 12:8) But we
do not read what happened in the time of Moses, or Joshua son of Nave, or the
judges or the kings. It is therefore permissible to hear by these hornets the
goads of fear which tormented the above-mentioned peoples, and forced them to
retire before the children of Israel. It is God who speaks and if his speech,

he said to Moses, "Go up to the Lord, you and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abiud,

and Moses shall draw near to the Lord alone, for them they will not come near,
and the born people will not go up with them. Now Moses came and told the
people all the words and all the ordinances of God, and the people answered all
with one voice, saying, We will do and hear all things, which the Lord has
spoken." Until this passage of Scripture it is understood that
justifications are the precepts given to the people to observe them. But as
soon as they are indicated by the words of Scripture, whence this word
"justifications" has arisen, they start from that Hebrew servant,
whose ear is pierced by the door. (Cf. Exod. 21:6) Now, in all these
justifications we must take into account those that can be saved by themselves
to act in life and to preserve good morals. (Cf. Exod. 21:1) Because,
evidently, there are mysteries in them that, rather than instructing our life,
are there to mean something. The Latin translators called <i>iustificationes</i></font><font size="3"> to what the Greeks call </font><i><font size="3">dikaiómata</font></i><font size="3">.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Moses went up with Aaron and Nadab, and Abihu and seventy of the elders of

to the experts that God cannot be covered by any place or put his limbs in any
kind of body posture, as we do that we sit, lie down, stand and take other
similar positions. Because these postures are proper to bodies, and God is
spirit. (Cf. Jn. 4:24) Therefore, when God manifests himself with some bodily

one of the elect of Israel was in disagreement. They appeared in God's place
and ate and drank.” Who could doubt that those whom he pointed out by their
names and the seventy elders are now called elect of Israel? These undoubtedly
represented the elect in the people of God. Because faith does not belong to
everyone, (2 Thess. 3:2) and the Lord knows those who are his. (2 Tim. 2:19) In
a large house there are utensils for noble uses and others for vile uses. (Cf.
2 Tim. 2:20) For those whom he foreknew he also predestined; and whom he
predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified them;
and those he justified, he also glorified them. (Rom. 8:29-30) Evidently, not
one of the elect of Israel was in disagreement. But they are represented by the
number four: Moses and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu, by four gospels and by the
promise of the whole world, which is divided into four parts. And the seventy
elders of Israel, that is, number seven multiplied by ten, which is to signify
the Holy Spirit. The sapphire, meanwhile, means the heavenly life, especially
because it says: Like the aspect of the sky. And who does not know that the sky
is called heaven? And the shape of the side in the sapphire itself means the
square or the stability or the mystery of the number four itself. The fact that
they eat and drink in the place of God means the softness and satiety they will
have in that realm of eternity. Effectively: “Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for justice, because they will be satisfied.” (Matt. 5:6) Therefore, the
Lord says that many will come, and who are more than the elect, the foreknown,
the predestined, the called, the justified, the glorified, and will sit with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. And in another place he
promises his faithful the same thing: that he will make them sit down and going
from one to the other will serve them. (Luke 12:37)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

perhaps mean that the New Testament by the name of Jesus is not only hidden in

already called Joshua (Jesus) when Scripture attests in the book of Numbers
that received that name (Cf. Num. 13:17) when the Israelites are about to enter
the promised land, it must be pointed out that Scripture therefore anticipates
here on a later event. Because all these things were written after they were
made. And so, when what is now remembered took place, he was not yet called
Joshua (Jesus). On the other hand, when this was written, it is called like

surrounds the four parts to a square object, as are usually square tables.” To

them on her four sides: two rings on one side and two rings on the other.” (Exod.
25:11) This means that in the four angles there are four rings, one ring in
each angle. And due to the number of angles it happens that what is put on two
sides is put into each of the four. For an angle is common to two sides.
Otherwise it cannot be that two rings are placed on all four sides, having only
four rings. Because they should be eight, if it is understood differently from
the one I just explained, according to the number of angles. Indeed, the rings
are placed at the corners to introduce the poles or rods, which serve for four
men on the one hand and on the other transport the ark. (Cf. Exod. 25:12-13)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

asked what the mercy seat on the ark means. As it was to be of gold and to have
in length and width the dimensions given for the ark, there is no doubt that it
was like a golden table intended to cover the ark itself: two cherubim were on
the mercy seat, looking at each other; their faces were on the side of the
mercy seat, and they covered it with their wings, a subject full of mystery.
Gold means wisdom, and the ark, the mystery of God. It was commanded that the
law, the manna and the rod of Aaron be put in the ark. The law contains the
commandments. The rod signifies the power. The manna, grace. Because without
grace there is no possibility of keeping the commandments. But since the law is
not perfectly fulfilled by anyone on the path to perfection, that is why the
mercy seat is on top. For to do that, it is necessary that God be propitious.
And that's why the mercy seat is placed on it. Because mercy is superior to
judgment. (James 2:13) The two cherubim give shade with their wings to the
mercy seat, that is, they honor the mercy seat covering it. Because there are
the mysteries. And they look at each other, because they are in perfect
agreement, for there the two testaments are represented, and their faces are
directed towards the mercy seat, because they strongly recommend the mercy of
God, in which hope is unique. Finally, God promised that he would speak from
here to Moses, from among the cherubim, on the mercy seat. Now, if the rational
creature with the abundance of knowledge, since the cherubim receive this
interpretation, is meant by these two animals, that is why there are two of
them, to instruct the union of love. And they cover with their wings the mercy
seat, since they attribute their wings to God, not to themselves, that is, they
honor God with the virtues for which they stand out. And their faces are
directed only to the mercy seat, because the hope for any progress in the
abundance of knowledge rests only in the mercy of God.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that ten curtains be made for the tabernacle: this is the image of the ten
commandments of the Law. The curtains, because of their magnitude, signify the
easy fulfillment of the commandments. That is why the same width is
recommended, when it is said: “You have widened my steps under me and my
footsteps have not been weakened.” (Ps. 17:37) But as this widening is done by
the grace of God, for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts, not by
ourselves, but by the Holy Spirit that has been given to us, (Rom. 5:5) that is
why this same number is mystically recommended here, which also refers to the
Holy Spirit, by means of which the law can be fulfilled. It is said that the curtains
must be twenty-eight cubits in length. (Cf. Exod. 26:2) Well, this same number,
since you have to divide it by seven, means that the width of the curtains must
have four cubits. Because four times seven is twenty-eight. And this is also a
perfect number, because, like the six, it consists of its parts. And what the

The veils are of hair, of goat hair, and they will be eleven.” In every sin
there is a transgression. Now, the transgression is indicated by the number
eleven, because the number ten is transgressed, which is the law.” (Cf. Gal. 3:19)
And so, eleven multiplied by seven, are seventy-seven, in whose number the Lord
symbolized all the forgiveness of sins, saying: “Not only seven times, but
seventy-seven times.” (Matt. 28:22) And these are the generations that there
are when Luke, counting backward from the baptism of the Lord, comes to Adam
and then to God. (Cf. Luke 3:23-38) The meaning of the sins in these veils
serves to make them manifest through confession and be forgiven for the grace
that has been given to the Church; that is, to be covered, according to what
the Scripture says: “Blessed are those whose iniquities have been forgiven and
whose sins have been covered for them.” (Ps. 31:1) Then the Scripture commands
that these veils be covered with ram skins dyed red. Well, who does not think
that the ram dyed red is Christ bloodied by the Passion? These skins also
indicate the holy martyrs, through whose prayers God shows himself propitious
with the sins of his people. On them, finally, they must go hyacinth-colored
skins to signify eternal life with greenness as perpetual vigor.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Holies." This means that between the holy and the holy of the holies this
veil must be, which is now spoken of, spread over the four columns. From the
difference between the holy and the holy of the holys is spoken in the epistle
to the Hebrews, (Cf. Heb. 9:1-12) because the holy of the holies is inside,
behind the veil, where the ark of the covenant is found. Outside, where is the
table and the candlestick and the other things that shortly before said how
they should be done, is called the holy, and is not the holy of the holies.
Outside is the Old Testament symbolized; within, the New, being one and the
other not only expressed with works, but figuratively with meaning in the
reading of the Old Testament. Therefore, in the holy there is a figure of the
figure, because it is the figure of the Old Testament. In the holy of the holies
there is a figure of the truth itself, because it is a figure of the New
Testament. Thus the whole Old Testament in these things and celebrations, which
are commanded to be observed in this way, is a figure.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

It is asked how God requires that the alter be three cubits high, since this
measure is about the size of the man. How, then, could one serve at the altar,
since elsewhere it is forbidden to establish degrees which lead to it? "In
fear," says the sacred text, "you cannot see what is shameful."
But there was a question of the altar, which was to be either earth or stone,
and the steps of which had become one with it; while here the altar with which
God ordains the construction was to be of wood; if at the hour when the Levite
fulfilled his office, something was deposited on the altar and was to be
removed from it, when he had finished his duties, this object certainly did not
form a part of the altar. How, again, could fire be sacrificed on an altar of
wood, especially when one thinks that the altar should be hollow, and the
grating placed in the middle of the cavity? Could it be that in this text:
"Thou shalt make horns that rise up at the four corners of the altar, and
cover them with brass." (Exod. 27:2) these last words: "Thou shalt
cover them with brass," do not refer only to the horns of the altar, but
to all the other materials that were to enter into its construction?</span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font size="3"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font size="3"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font size="3"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><br /></p><font size="3"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><br /></p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify">

wanted to signify that in the priestly dress there are certain data that
certainly allude to the Church through these bells, so that the behavior that

times before. And the garment of the saint, of Aaron, will be for his children
after him, to anoint them with them and consecrate their hands. For seven days
the one of his sons who will succeed him as a priest will clothe them, who will
enter the tabernacle of the testimony to serve in the holy things (Ex 29, 29.30).
These words pose many problems. In the first place, it is necessary to notice
that here it is spoken of the vesture of the saint. And then it is said in the
plural: To anoint them with them, as if they were the garments. It had also
been said before that there were many such garments, of which there was only
one. Although it is doubtful whether the expression in ipsis (with them) is in
place of ipsa, in neutral gender, encompassing all that constitutes the
vesture, the priestly dress. And that, in fact, it is more about this seems to
be deduced from what is said below: For seven days the (ea: neutral) will wear
whoever succeeds him as a priest, that is, he will wear all those things that
were mentioned to the describe the priestly dress. Repeat then what he had said
before: To consecrate his hands. I already explained before what I thought this
meant. The following sentence: For seven days the priest will wear them, does
that mean that during the other days he will not wear them? The author wanted
to say that those seven days were followed, during which his priesthood was
consecrated in a certain way and its beginning was celebrated for a week. Mark
as Aaron's successor who enters the tabernacle of testimony to serve in holy
things. This means that it could only be one, not like Aaron's sons were while
his father lived. Aaron's own successor was one. How is it said that it is
proper for this one to enter the tabernacle of the testimony to serve in holy
things, if the things that are outside the veil hidden by the "sancta
sanctorum" are also called "sancta" (holy things) and are call
also the tabernacle of the testimony to that where the holy things are, that
is, the table and the candlestick? Since the priests who follow him also serve
beside the table and the chandelier and the altar itself, how is it said that he
must be the sole successor of Aaron who enters the tabernacle of the testimony
to serve in the holy things? If it had been said: to serve in the saint of
saints, there would be no problem, because only the high priest entered this
place, where the ark of the covenant was. Which is also remembered in detail in
the Epistle to the Hebrews (Cf Hb 7-11). Unless, by saying that one only
entered the tabernacle of the testimony to serve in holy things, do not want it
to be understood more than the saint of saints, since this place is also called
"sancta". But not all things that are holy can also be called
"sancta sanctorum." On the other hand, all things that are
"sancta sanctorum" are undoubtedly also "sancta". And the
Epistle to the Hebrews, mentioned before, says very clearly that this one who
entered the year once in the "sancta sanctorum" meant Christ the
Lord.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It seems
to me that what is prefigured in the saint of saints is also symbolized in the
priestly garment itself. On the ark, which contained the law, was the mercy
seat, in which the mercy of God must be seen, which forgives the sins of those
who do not obey the law. Because the clothing itself, what does it mean but the
mysteries of the Church? Because in the logio, in the rational one, placed in
the priest's chest, he instituted the judgments. In the picture, on the other
hand, sanctification and the offering for sins, as if the rational one were in
the chest, similar to the ark, in which the law was, and the blade was on the
forehead, like the mercy seat, that was on the ark. And so, in both, what

gold under its molded mold, at its sides. You will do them on both sides (Ex

klíte means sides and pleura also means sides, some Latin translators have
translated: In two parts you will do them on both sides. But the Greek does not
say mére, which means parts, but klíte, which means sides. This word appears in
that psalm that says: Your wife as a fruitful vine on the sides of your house (Sal
127,3). And for that reason, it is only necessary to pay attention to the case,
because first he put accusative and then ablative: you will do them on both
sides (accusative); on its two sides (ablative). In any case, it is difficult
to know what the meaning is. As the Scripture usually uses the ellipsis,
omitting something that needs to be replaced, perhaps here too the word will
have to be replaced, in which case the meaning would be: You will do them on
both sides, they will be on both sides, that is, you will make the rings

Lord in his generations. He calls it continuous incense, because it had to be
offered continuously, without any interruption. By prescribing what pertained
to the altar of incense, to the altar in which only incense was put, not the
burnt offering, the sacrifice, or the drink offering, the Lord had commanded
that the same incense be offered daily. But now it says: And Aaron shall make
the propitiation or make the prayer on the horns of the altar once a year with
the blood of the purification of sins, of the propitiation. Depropitiationis
(of the propitiation) comes from depropitiatio (propitiation), which
corresponds to the Greek word exilasmós. Therefore, it is necessary to
understand that what he commands to do once a year to have propitiation to God
on the horns of the altar of incense, that is, so that with the blood of the
purification of sins, with the blood of the victims they offer themselves for
sins, once a year they touch the horns of the altar of incense, it does not
belong to that action of putting the incense that they had commanded to do
every day. For that act was done with aromas, not blood, and every day, not
once a year. Therefore, it is not necessary to think that the priest used to
enter once a year in the saint of the saints, but that he entered once a year
with the blood, and, naturally, he used to enter every day without the blood to
put the incense . But with the blood came only once a year. And this must be
understood in this way, mainly, by what is said next: Once a year he will
purify it; He is the saint of the saints for the Lord (Ex 30,16). He will not
put the incense there once a year, because God commanded to put it every day.
But once a year he will purify it. And this ordered that he take control of the
blood. And then he adds: He is the saint of the saints for the Lord. And so, if
the saint of the saints was not outside, but inside the veil, surely the altar
that is now mentioned, which he commanded to be placed before the veil, ordered
that it also be placed inside.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

to anoint with the oil of the anointing all the things, that is to say, the
tabernacle and the things that were in it, and then it adds: They will be
sancta sanctorum (Ex 30,29). This means that all things, once anointed, will be
"sancta sanctorum." It is necessary to investigate more thoroughly
the difference that could exist between those interior things, covered by the
veil, and the others, if all of them, once anointed, become "sancta
sanctorum". This we thought it appropriate to point out. In this regard we
will also remember: With reference to the sacrificial altar, which the author
wanted to be called the saint's saint after the anointing, immediately before
it was said: Everyone who touches it will be sanctified (Ex 29,37). When
speaking after all those things that, once anointed with that anointing,
receive the name of "sancta sanctorum", the same affirmation
continues: All who touch them will be sanctified (Ex 30,29), which can be
understood in two ways: Or be sanctified when touched, or sanctified so that it
is lawful to touch them, if it was not lawful for the people to touch the
tabernacle when it presented sacrifices or anything else the people contributed
to offer it to God. And in keeping with this the text warns that it is not only
to say to the priests or the Levites what God says to Moses: And you will speak
to the children of Israel - the children of Israel were, of course, all that
people - telling them: This oil, which will be used for the anointing, will be a
saint for you in your generations. He will not anoint man's flesh; and you
shall not do anything similar to this composition for yourselves. It is holy
and it will be sanctification for you. Whoever makes another like him and
whoever gives part of him to a foreign nation, will be exterminated from his
people. The Lord commands not only the priests, but all the people of Israel,
not to make such an ointment for ordinary uses. For this is what it means: It
will not anoint the flesh of man. It forbids, then, that something similar be
done for ordinary uses and threatens death to whoever does something similar,
that is, to whoever makes a similar ointment for ordinary uses or who gives it
to a foreign nation. But for what is said next: It will be sanctification for
you, since God commands that this be said to all the people of Israel, I do not
see how it can be interpreted, unless it is admitted that it was lawful for the
people to touch the tabernacle when each one came with his own offerings, and,
when touched, they were sanctified by that oil with which they anointed all
things. And that is why it is added: Everyone who touches it will be
sanctified. But the people were not sanctified as the priests, who were also
anointed with the oil to perform the priestly functions.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

Scripture says, "It will be an everlasting covenant in me and in the
children of Israel?" (Ex 31,16.17) It does not say: between me and the
children of Israel. Does he say it this way perhaps because the Sabbath means
rest and we have no rest except in it? Because, evidently, he calls the
children of Israel all his people, that is, the descendants of Abraham. And
there is one Israel according to the flesh and another according to the spirit.
For if only Israel were called descendants according to the flesh, the Apostle
would not say: See Israel according to the flesh (1Co 10,18). Here, of course,
it indicates that there is an Israel according to the spirit, who is a Jew in
the interior and in the circumcision of the flesh (Rm 2,29). Therefore, perhaps
it is necessary to make a separation, reading like this: It will be an eternal
covenant in me. And then the other meaning would be: And for the children of
Israel it will be an eternal sign, that is, a sign of an eternal thing, as, for
example, the stone was Christ, because the stone signified Christ (Cf 1Co 10,4).
Therefore, it is not necessary to unite the phrase thus: It will be eternal
covenant in me and in the children of Israel, as if this covenant was in God
and in the children of Israel. But it must be put like this: It will be eternal
covenant in me - because in God eternal rest has been promised - and for the
children of Israel it will be an eternal sign, because the children of Israel
received this sign to keep it, a sign that means rest eternal for the true
Israelites, that is, for the children of the promise (Cf Ga 4,28) and for those
who will see God face to face as it is.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

the people for the making of the calf that Aaron did (Ex 32,35), especially
considering that here the same thing is emphasized, repeating the same idea.
Indeed, the Scripture does not say: And the Lord punished the people for the
making of the calf which they had made, but Aaron did. And yet, Aaron is not
punished. Moreover, what God had ordained about his priesthood before
committing that sin was fulfilled. But God commanded that he and his children
wash themselves. And in this way they received priestly ordination. God knows
who he forgives until he changes for the better, and also knows who he forgives

point that we are not loved by God, we can be represented before him by the

and not simply as an admonition and as a way of expressing that he would be
relieved from applying the punishment, he would have to be obeyed. In any case,

Canaanite, and the Amorite, and to the Hittite, and to the Perizzite, and to
the Girgash, and to the Jiveo, and to the Jebusite, and he will take you to a
land flowing with milk and honey. I will not go up with you, for you are a
stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way (Ex 33,2.3). There is an
extraordinary, admirable and profound mystery here, since it seems that the
angel could have a greater mercy than the Lord, since the angel would forgive a
stiff-necked people; God, if I went with them, I would not forgive them. In
spite of everything, although God is somehow absent from them, he, who can not
be absent anywhere, says that he will also fulfill what he swore to his parents
through his angel. He seems to want to show here, too, that he does this
precisely because he promised it to those righteous fathers, not because these
now were worthy. What does it mean but it is not with them just because they
are stiff-necked men, since God does not make him more propitious and savior
than humility and piety? Well, to say that God is with stiff-necked men is
merely to affirm that He is with them to correct and punish them. Therefore,
when God is not in that way with the bad, he is forgiving them. And this is
confirmed by the text that says: Turn your face away from my sins (Ps. 50,11).
Because if you put it aside, it destroys them; for as the wax melts before the
fire, so sinners perish before God (Ps. 67,3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

33,12-13).</strong> And Moses said to the Lord: "Look, you say to me: Get this
people out; but you have not indicated to me who you will send along with me;
even though you told me: I know you more than all of you, and you have found
grace before me. If, then, I have found grace before you, show yourself to me,
that I see you clearly, so that I may find grace before you and so that I may
know that this nation is your people. " The word gnostos, that appears in
the Greek, some Latin translators have expressed it by manifesté (clearly), in
spite of the fact that the Scripture has not said pigeons. Perhaps it could
have been translated better: If I have found grace before you, show yourself to
me, that I see you knowing it (scienter). With these words Moses clearly shows
that in the midst of that great familiarity of contemplation he did not see him
as he wished to see him, because all those visions of God that were granted to
the human gaze and from which a sound was derived that reached the mortal ears
, they took place assuming a form as God wanted, in the form that they wanted,
so that in those visions, one does not feel with any corporal sense one's
divine nature, which is invisible and is everywhere and does not include any.
And because of the two commandments, of the love of God and of neighbor,
depends the whole law (Cf Mt 22,46), that is why Moses showed his desire in one
and the other: in the love of God, when he says: If I have found grace before
you, show yourself to me , that sees you clearly, so that it finds grace before
you. And in the love of neighbor, when he says: And so that he knows that this
nation is your people.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

all? Does God know some other things and other things less? Or is it something
similar to what is said of some in the Gospel: I do not know you? (Mt 25,12)
Ultimately, God knew Moses more than all, because Moses liked God above all,
that is, he knew him with that kind of knowledge according to which it is said
that God knows the things that he likes and that he does not know the things
that displease him; not because he ignores them, but because he does not
approve of them; as it is said with all property that the art does not know the
vices, nevertheless that it experiences vices.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

before Moses remembered him. By this we understand that not all the things that
God spoke with Moses have been written. In any case, it is necessary to
investigate more carefully in the previous parts of the Scripture to see if it
really is that way.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

33,18-19).</strong> When Moses asked the Lord: Show me your glory, the Lord answered
him: I will come before you with my glory and I will call with the name of the
Lord in your presence: and I will have mercy on whom I will have pity, and I
will have mercy on whom I have had mercy (Ex 33,19) , even though the Lord had
told you shortly before: I myself will pass before you and give you rest (Ex
33,14). The expression: I will pass in front of you seems to be that Moses
understood it in the sense that God would not be present with him and with the
people during the trip, and that is why he says: If you do not come with us, do
not make me leave from here (Ex 33,15), etc. However, God did not deny him
this, but said to him: I will do to you also what you have asked me (Ex 33,17).
Therefore, when Moses said to him: Show me your glory, how does it seem to say
to you again: I myself will pass before you, implying that I was going to
precede you and I was not going to accompany you, unless it is something else?
Because it is understood that he speaks to him and says: I will pass before
you, the same one who says the gospel: The time has come to pass Jesus from
this world to the Father (Jn 13,1). This step or transit is often interpreted
as Easter. It is, therefore, a very great prophecy. For he, Jesus, before all
the saints passed from this world to the Father to prepare the mansions of the
kingdom of heaven, which he will give them in the resurrection of the dead,
because he, who was to pass before all, became in the firstborn among the dead
(Cf Col 1,18).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">At the
same time he highlights his grace, saying: And I will call with the name of the
Lord in your presence. As if it were done in the presence of the people of
Israel, whose image represented Moses when he heard these words. Christ the
Lord is called in all nations in the presence of his own nation scattered
everywhere. And it is said: I will call (vocabo) and I will not be called
(vocabor). The verb becomes active and not passive, using a genre of unusual
expression, in which there is undoubtedly a great hidden sense. With this
expression perhaps he wanted to indicate that he himself does this, that is to
say, he does with his grace that the Lord be called (invoked) in all nations.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And I will
take pity on whom I will have pity and I will have mercy on whom I will have
had mercy. By adding these words, he manifests in a much clearer way the
vocation with which he called us to his kingdom and his glory, not by our
merits, but by his mercy. And since God promised that he would bring the
Gentiles into his kingdom, saying: "I will call with the name of the Lord
in your presence, he came to tell us that this was done mercifully, as the
Apostle says: For I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the
truth of God to confirm the promises of the fathers, so that the Gentiles might
glorify God for his mercy (Rm 15,8.9). For he had predicted this: I will take
pity on whom I will have pity and I will have mercy on whom I have had mercy.
With these words he forbade man to glory, as if it were the merits of his own
virtues, affirming that whoever boasts will boast in the Lord (2Co 10,17). He
does not say: I will take pity on such and such, but on whom I will have pity,
so that no one believes that he merited the mercy of such a great vocation for
his previous good works. For Christ died for the ungodly (Rm 5,6).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But I do
not know if he wanted to repeat this when he said: And I will have mercy on
whom I have had mercy - or as others translate: with whom I have been merciful
- or if there is any difference between the two phrases. For what the Greek
language expresses with two eleeso and oikteiréso verbs-words that seem to mean
the same thing-the Latin translator could not express it with different words
and repeated the same idea in two different ways. But if it had been said:
"I will take pity on who gave me mercy" and "I will take pity on
who gave me mercy" or "I will take pity on whom I will have
pity," it would not seem that he had expressed himself well enough. And
yet, that sense is stronger there, because God, with that repetition, or shows
the firmness of his mercy-like "amen, amen," (Cf Jn 5,19.24.25; Sal
88,53; 71,19; Gn 41,1-7) or "fiat, fiat," or like the repetition of
Pharaoh's dream and many other similar examples, or God foretold in that way
that he would have mercy on both peoples, the Gentiles and the Hebrews, which
the Apostle expresses thus: For as you once did not believe in God, but now you
have obtained mercy for cause of their unbelief, so they did not believe now on
the occasion of your mercy, so that they too may obtain mercy. For God
imprisoned all in unbelief, to have compassion on everyone (Rm 11,30-32).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Then,
after this affirmation of his mercy, God responds to what was asked of him:
Show me your glory (Ex 33,18). Or what Moses had asked before with these words:
Show yourself to me, that I see you clearly (Ex 33,13). And God responds: You
will not be able to see my face; No one can see my face and live (Ex 33,20).
With these words the author shows that God can not appear as he is in this life,
which is lived under the mortal senses of the corruptible flesh. That is to
say, as it is, God can only be seen in that life in which, to be able to live
it, one must die to it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Interposing
a sentence, the Scripture says next: And the Lord said; and then he adds: Here
is a place next to me (Ex 33,21). But what place is not next to God, who is not
absent from anywhere? With these words: Here is a place next to me, the Church
is symbolized, as if referring to a temple, and continues saying: You will
stand on the rock - because, as the Lord says: On this stone I will build my
Church (Mt 16,18) as soon as my glory passes, that is, as soon as my glory
passes, he will stand on the rock, because after the passage of Christ, that
is, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, the faithful people will be
of foot on the rock. And it continues: And I will put you in the cave of the
rock. This means a very strong defense. Others, on the other hand, translate:
On the watchtower of the rock. But the Greek has open door, and this we
translate more exactly by hole or cavern.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And I will
cover you with my hand until I pass, Then I will remove my hand and then you
will see my back; but my face will not see it (Ex 33,22.23). Since before he
said: You will be standing on the rock as soon as my glory passes -text which
means that after its passage God promises stability on the rock-, how is it
necessary to interpret the words: I will put you in the cave of the rock and I
will cover you with my hand until I pass. Then I will take my hand away and
then you will see my back? Does it mean that once Moses is placed on the rock,
God will cover him with his hand and then pass by, not being able to stand on
the rock but after the passage of the Lord? In fact, it is necessary to see
here a recapitulation of an omitted thing, as Scripture often does. In effect,
he says later what in the order of time is earlier. The order would be as
follows: I will cover you with my hand until I pass, and then you will see my
backs; but my face you will not see it. And you will be standing on the rock as
soon as my glory passes and I will put you in the rock cavern. This, indeed,
happened with those whom the person of Moses meant, that is, with the
Israelites, who later believed in the Lord Jesus, as the Acts of the Apostles
say, that is, as soon as his glory passed (Cf Acts 2). For after rising from
the dead and rising to heaven, as the apostles spoke the tongues of all nations
by the coming of the Holy Spirit from heaven, many of those who had crucified
Christ repented. As they did not recognize him and crucified the Lord of glory,
partial blindness came to Israel (Rm 11,25), according to what had been said: I
will cover you with my hand until I pass. And that's why the psalm says:
Because day and night your hand has weighed on me. It calls day at the time
when Christ worked miracles; and night, at the time when he died as a man, when
those who had believed during the day hesitated. When it has passed, then you
will see my back: this means that when I have passed from this world to the
Father, then those whom you represent will believe in me. Because then, with
deep hearts, they said: What shall we do? And the apostles commanded them to do
penance and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, so that their sins would
be forgiven (Cf Acts 2,37.38). In the quoted psalm, after the words: Day and
night your hand has weighed on me - that is, so that I did not know; for if
they had known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory (1Co 2,8)
the author continues saying: "The grief has fallen on me, while the spine
was stuck," (Ps. 31,4) that is, when I was pricked in my heart. Then he
continues: I recognized my sin and I did not hide my evil (Ps.31,5). Then they
understood with what great sin they crucified Christ. And since they accepted
the advice to do penance and to receive in the baptism the forgiveness of sins,
he says: I said: «I will confess the crime against the Lord against me», and
you forgave the impiety of my heart.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Reality
itself sufficiently indicates that this prophecy was rather what the Lord said
to Moses, since nothing is read that has happened after a visible way about his
rock or his cave, or the placement of his hand or the vision of their backs.
The Scripture, in effect, adds immediately, inserting a phrase: And the Lord
said to Moses, when in fact the Lord also said those things that are before.

people, that is, of the people to whom you belong, as we say "your

of which you are a citizen? A little further on it also says: All the town you

the people, of whom Moses is the chief? But Moses did not lead the people to
that land, where God forbids making an alliance with those who lived there. It
is, in short, a kind of rare expression and that I have not yet found or I have

destroys all idolatry and the people does not worship any other God, he says:
For the Lord is a God whose name is Jealous, he is a jealous God (Ex 34,14).
This means that the very name by which the Lord God is designated is Jealous,
because He is a jealous God. This quality, distinct from the vice of human
disturbance, always and in all circumstances God is immutable and calm. But
with that word it is indicated that God will not leave his people unpunished if
he is not faithful to him, worshiping other gods. The word is taken in a
metaphorical sense of marital zeal, by means of which the husband keeps the
chastity of the wife, which is useful to us, but not to God. Because who could
harm God with that kind of fornication? On the other hand, it causes great harm
to oneself, because it leads to perdition. God forbids this infidelity with a
very serious terror, calling himself Jealous. Of him it is said in the psalm:
You have caused all who are unfaithful to perish; but for me it is a good to be
united to God (Ps. 72,27.28). Finally, the text says: Lest you make an alliance

the property of things, as in the case of the rock and the cavern and the

narrator's fidelity is that what he says happened has actually happened, and

commandments. Now it is said that Moses himself wrote. A little before God had
told him: Write these words (Ex 34,28). But when he received the law for the
first time and threw away the boards, he was not told that he had made them, as
it is now said: Wash two tables of stone, (Ex 34,1) and he was not commanded to
write them, as the Scripture says: the tables the words of the covenant, the
ten commandments. The previous time it was said: And he gave Moses, as soon as
he stopped talking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the covenant,
tablets of stone, written by the finger of God (Ex 31,18 ). And shortly
afterwards he adds: And Moses turned and came down from the mountain with the
two tablets of the covenant in his hands, tables of stone written on both
sides; they were written by one and on the other; and the tablets were the work
of God, and the writing, engraved on the tablets, was the writing of God (Ex
32,15.15). That is why a serious question arises of knowing how those tablets
that Moses was going to break, knowing God in advance, are said to be not the
work of man, but of God, and that they were not written by man, but by God, the
finger of God. On the other hand, the other tablets that were to last so long
and that were to be in the tabernacle and in the temple, by God's command, were
carved by man and written by man. In those first were meant the grace of God,
not the work of man, grace from which the Hebrews became unworthy, returning
with desire to Egypt and becoming the idol-for which they were deprived of that
benefit and Moses broke The tables? Was it meant in these second ones to those
who boast about their works that is why the Apostle says: Ignoring the justice
of God and wanting to establish his own, they did not submit to the justice of
God (Rm 10, 3) and that is why tables were given engraved and written by the
work of man, that they remain with men to signify those who would boast of
their works, not of the finger of God, that is, of the Spirit of God?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the handing over of the law for the second time means the New Testament-the Old
Testament signified that first law, whose tables were broken and the law
abolished-especially since when the law is given a second time, it is given
without any terror, as when that first occurred in the midst of so much noise
of fire, clouds and trumpets, for which the people, terrified, exclaimed: That
God does not speak to us, lest we die. (Ex 20,19) Where it is meant that in the
Old Testament there is fear, and in the New, love.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

does the question of knowing why these tablets were God's work, and these, the
work of man; those, written by the finger of God, and these, written by man? Is
it perhaps that the former meant the Old Testament, precisely because God in
them imposed his precepts and man did not fulfill them? The law was given in
the Old Testament to convince the transgressors, a law that entered so that the
crime would abound. Evidently, this law was not fulfilled by fear, which can
not be fulfilled except by love. But it is called the work of God, because the
law was established by God, God wrote it, it was not the work of man, because
man did not obey God, and the law made him guilty. In the second tables, man,
with the help of God, makes the tables and writes them, because the love of the
New Testament fulfills the law. Therefore the Lord says: I have not come to
abolish the law, but to fulfill it. And the Apostle adds: Love is the fullness
of the law (Rm 13,10) and faith that acts by love (Ga 5,6). Thus, what in the
Old Testament was difficult, in the New Testament it is easy for the man who
has the faith who acts by love and when the finger of God, the Spirit of God,
has written it in, in the heart, not outside, on a stone. That is why the
Apostle says: Not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of flesh of the heart, (2Co
3,3) because the love of God, through which the precept is truly fulfilled, has
been poured out in your hearts by the Holy Spirit, who He has given us (Rm 5,5).
Therefore, the law was first given-in which the Old Testament is represented,
which is the work of God alone and which was written by the finger of God. And
that is why the Apostle says: Thus, the law is certainly holy and the command
is holy, and just and good (Rm 7,12). Then the holy and good law is the work of
God, in which man does nothing, because he does not obey, but rather becomes
guilty under the threat and condemnation of the law. Therefore the Apostle
says: Sin, so that it appears as sin, by means of a good thing, procured death
for me (Rm 7,13). But man is happy when this holy and just and good command is
also his work, but through the grace of God.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

construction of the tabernacle and the making of the priestly vestments are
remembered. But before ordering anything about the way of doing these things,
Moses reminds the people of the obligation to keep the Sabbath. Well, it is
something that draws attention and not without reason why, after receiving a
second time the words of the law on the stone tablets, which he himself worked
and he wrote himself, only speaks to the people about the Saturday after of his
descent from the mountain. For if it was superfluous for the people to hear the
ten commandments of the law for the second time, why should it not be
superfluous to speak of the Sabbath, since it is already spoken of in the same
commandments? Or is it perhaps that this is similar to the veil that covered
his face, because the children of Israel could not contemplate the brightness
of it? (Cf Ex 34,34.35) Because of the ten commandments he only sent to the
people what was said there figuratively. With respect to the other nine
commandments as they are sent there, we do not doubt that they are also ordered
to be saved in the New Testament.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

other hand, that commandment on the Sabbath, was so veiled for the Israelites
with the figurative guard of the seventh day and was mysteriously imposed and
indicated with a certain secret, that we do not keep it today. We only see what
it meant. In that rest, which requires the abandonment of all servile work, the
height of God's grace is great. For good works are done with rest when faith
acts for love (Cf Ga 5,6). Fear produces torment, and in torment, what rest is
there? Therefore, in love there is no fear (1Jn 4,8), because love has been
poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that has been given to us (Rm 5,5).
That is why the Sabbath is the holy rest consecrated to the Lord (Ex 35,2),
that is, rest that must be attributed to the grace of God, not to us, as if it
came from us. Because, otherwise, our works will be as if they were human works
or sins, or made with fear and not with love, and therefore, servile works
without rest. But the fullness of the Sabbath will be in eternal rest. For it
has not been instituted uselessly even on Saturdays (Cf Lv 26,31).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

tabernacle, he said that with the same anointing all those things were
sanctified and became "sancta sanctorum." He had also said that the
altar of burnt offerings, sanctified with that anointing, became "the
saint's saint." And it seemed that he was interested not to call any of
those things "holy of the saints", but only to what was separated
from the saint by the veil, that is, where the ark of the covenant and the
altar of incense were. But now, in repeating the same things, he says about the
anointed tabernacle and the things that were in it that were sanctified with
the same anointing and became holy. And the altar of burnt offerings, of which
he had said before that he became "saint of the saint," now says that
with that same anointing he becomes "saint of the saints." From which
it follows that it means the same, what had been called "saint of the
saint" that what is called "saint of saints", and, therefore,
that all those anointed things, such as the tabernacle and everything that had
in it, which had previously been called "sancta sanctorum" they mean
the same as what is now called "sancta" and none of these things
after that anointing is called only "saint of the saint", but also
"saint of saints" , like the altar of holocausts. From this it
follows that there is no difference, as far as this name is concerned, between
the things that were inside the veil, where the ark of the covenant was, and
the other things that were outside, except for the fact that the things inside
were called "sancta sanctorum" or "saint of saints." And
they were called like this even before the anointing. Instead, the other things
were sanctified by the anointing so that they could be given that name. And

when the cloud came down and filled the tabernacle, a cloud called the glory of

God was (Cf Ex 20,21), when he received the law for the first time. There is no
doubt that he then represented one person and now another. Then he represented
those who become partakers of the intimate truth of God. Now, to the Jews, who
are opposed, like a cloud, to the glory of the Lord, who is in the
tabernacle-which is the grace of Christ-and who does not understand it. And
that is why Moses does not enter the tabernacle of the covenant. And we have to
think that this happened only once, immediately that the tabernacle was
erected, because of this meaning or any other. For the cloud was not always
above the tabernacle, so that Moses could not enter there. For the cloud did
not disappear, except when the sign was given to the Israelites to depart, to
raise the camp from where they were and to approach where the cloud led them
during the day, and to call it during the night (Cf Ex 13,21). And these two
things also remained on the tabernacle, wherever they had set up the camp, that
is, the cloud during the day and the flame during the night.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the book of Exodus ends with the construction of the tabernacle, of which many
things are also said in other places preceding the book itself, which present
certain difficulties of comprehension, as is usually the case with every
narrative on any subject of topography, it is To say, from the description of a
place, it seemed to me opportune to speak separately of the whole tabernacle so
that it is understood, as far as possible, what it was and what it was exactly,
according to the property of the narration, omitting and leaving for another
moment its figurative significance. Because we can not think that there was
something that by God's will was done without having the meaning of some great
mystery, whose knowledge does not contribute to the building up of faith and
the formation of piety.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">2. (Ex 26,1,6).
God commanded Moses to make the tabernacle with ten tapestries of fine twisted
linen, of hyacinth and purple and scarlet twine, and embroidered cherubs.
Latinos translate by aulaea (tapestries, curtains) the Greek word aulaías,
which corresponds to what we commonly call curtains. Therefore, God did not
command ten courts, as some have inadvertently translated, since the text does
not say aulás, but aulaías. He ordered embroidered cherubs to be made on
tapestries. He ordered that the length of the tapestries be twenty-eight
cubits, and the width four. He ordered the tapestries to be joined and linked
together, five on one side and five on the other, so that the space they
covered was the space of the tabernacle itself. With the following words he
orders how the five tapestries were to be joined to each other: You will make
them hyacinth bows on the edge of the tapestry with which the first series
ends; and you will do the same on the edge with which the second series ends (Ex
26,4). This means that the ties will be where one tapestry joins the other,
that is, the third with the second, because the second is already united with
the first, united and connected with it, since they are each face to face, one
in front of the other, because they were ordered to join five by five, facing
each other. But it still does not appear if the space they surrounded was
square or round. It will appear when you start talking about the columns on
which the tapestries are supported. Therefore, the Lord has wanted to speak
only of the union of three that is made by two joints, from the second to the
first and from the third to the second, so that the others are linked together
by this kind of rule. As regards the bonds, the Lord commanded that fifty be
made in the first tapestry for the part that would join the second, and another
fifty ties in the third tapestry for the part that would join the second tapes
(Cf Ex 26,5.6). Regarding this second, who was in the middle, among the fifty
loops of one part and the other, the Lord commanded that he had fifty rings of
gold on the one hand, by means of which he would join the fifty loops of the
first tapestry. For this reason, it was natural that the other party also had
fifty other rings by means of which it would join the ties of the third party.
The Scripture describes all this briefly as follows: And you shall make fifty
rings of gold, and you shall bind one tapestry with the other by means of the
rings. And the tabernacle will be a unique space (Ex 26,6). Thus, the fifty
gold rings of the second tapestry were joined by the hyacinth ties of the first
tapestry. And so on, the others were intertwined until the five were completed,
and on the other hand the other five were joined in the same way.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">3. Then he
says: And you shall make veils of hair to cover the tabernacle (Ex 26,7). These
veils were to come over, but not over the part of the roof, but around the
tabernacle above. For we also say that something is put on, not as the roof of
a house, but as the stucco of a wall. Therefore, as if it were on a cloth band.
For the Lord says: You shall make eleven veils. The length of each veil shall
be thirty cubits, and the width of each veil shall be four cubits. The eleven
veils will have the same measure. And you will join five veils on one side and
six on the other (Ex 26,8.9). As he said earlier that these tapestries should
be joined five on one side and five on the other, so now he says that these
veils should be five on one side and six on the other, because the veils were
eleven, not ten. And then it continues: And you will bend the sixth according
to the facade of the tabernacle, so that it does not move, because the veils
were presented to each other in odd number, six and five. Then he also says how
these veils of hair should be joined together. And it says the same as before, but
perhaps more clearly. Well, it continues like this. And thou shalt make fifty
rings on the edge of the veil that is opposite to that of the middle one-that
is, against the second, because it shall be in the middle between the first and
the third-according to the joint, (Ex 26,10) that is, the union, and you shall
make fifty rings in the edge of the veil that is attached to the second, that
is, on the edge of the third veil, because it is attached to the second. And
you shall make fifty bronze rings and bind the rings in the rings; and you will
unite the veils and it will be a unique space (Ex 26,11). The Lord wanted,
then, that the rings be placed in the middle veil, that is, in the second, so
that it would be joined to the first and the third by the fifty rings on each
side. Here there is no other difference, but now it is commanded that the rings
be made of bronze instead of gold. With respect to the rings of the tapestries,
they had been ordered to be hyacinth. In the veils of hairs, however, since it
is not said what the rings were like, we should think as more likely that they
were of hair.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">4. What
follows next is so difficult to understand, that I fear it will be darker with
the explanation. It says: And you shall spread the portion that is over the
veils of the tabernacle; the half of the veil that you will spread over it;
what about the veils of the tabernacle you will spread out behind the
tabernacle; one cubit on the one hand and another cubit on the other part of
what is above the veils along the veils of the tabernacle will hang on the
sides of the tabernacle on the one hand and on the other so that it covers it.
Since he had ordered that the sixth veil should be folded according to the
facade of the tabernacle, who could easily understand what it means to have
half of the veil on the veils and what it means: one elbow on the one hand and
the other on the other hand when the half of the veil is fifteen cubits, since
it was commanded that each veil be thirty cubits? Or if there is something left
over in the length of the veils precisely because it was ordered that the first
tapestry of fine linen and scarlet and purple and hyacinth be twenty-eight
cubits long, instead, these veils of hairs had to be thirty cubits, and thus
each one of these veils of hairs exceeded in two elbows the length of each of
the tapestries. Added all these veils, except the eleventh, which had to bend,
give twenty elbows, which is the amount left over from the surface of the veils
of hairs in relation to the surface of the tapestries. Because twice ten cubits
of the veils that were longer than the tapestries make twenty cubits. Of those
twenty cubits, ten on one side and ten on the other could protrude on both
sides, not an elbow on one side and another elbow on the other side, as the
Scripture says.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore
it seems to me that we must leave for another moment the exposition of this
passage, that is, until the tabernacle is fully explained with all the columns
that are in the atrium that surrounds it. Because perhaps something is said in
advance about the veils of hair that serve to explain what has not been talked
about yet. For we do not know whether the words: And you shall make veils of
hair to cover the tabernacle (Ex 26,12.13), they refer to the fact that these
veils must be covered with the entire tabernacle together with the courtyard,
of which construction around the tabernacle is to be discussed later or only
this tabernacle interior that he ordered to make ten tapestries. For then it is
said: You will also make a covering for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red
(Ex 26,7). It is equally uncertain if this coverage should be made for
everything that surrounds the tabernacle or only for the inner tabernacle ...
The following sentence: And on top of that another hyacinth-colored hides
cover, it must be understood in the sense that the cover was not around, but
from the ceiling, as if it were a room.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">5. And
continue: And you shall make for the tabernacle pillars of incorruptible wood.
Each column shall have ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. Each
column will have two bays placed facing each other. You will do the same with
all the columns of the tabernacle (Ex 26,15-17). I do not see clearly why these
ancones are commanded to do, that I said before what they were. Because if they
were made to transport the columns, they would have to be at least four. If
they were to be supported by the crossbars, they would have to be several as
well, because five columns were assigned to each column. Unless these ancones
have no use, and have only one meaning, as in the eleventh veil of hair.
Because a column with two ancones, as if they were two arms, hanging on both
sides, has the shape of a cross. Let's see now the number of columns to know by
means of them if the shape of the tabernacle was square or round or if it had a
rectangular shape with the two longer lateral sides and the two shorter frontal
sides, as many basilicas are built. Because this is what is expressed rather
here with some evidence. For the Scripture says thus: And you shall make
pillars for the tabernacle: twenty pillars for the side facing north; and you
shall make forty bases of silver for the twenty pillars: two bases for each
pillar on either side. For the second side, to the south, you will make twenty
pillars with forty silver bases: two bases for each column on either side (Ex
26,18.21). The repetition should not pose problems, because it is a phrase by
which the same is understood of all others that does not mention. We already
said before why each column has two bases. Here capitals are called bases.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">6. We see,
then, that two sides of the tabernacle, that of the north and that of the
south, have twenty pillars each one along. There remain the other two, the east
and the west, which, if they had the same number of columns, would undoubtedly
form a square. Well, it is said how many columns have the west side, but it is
not said how many have the east side. I ignore the reason, if it is because it
had no columns and the tapestries were stretched there alone without columns,
from the last column on one side to the last column of the other, or if its
mention is omitted for some reason, even tacitly understood. . Because later,
in the same eastern part, ten columns are mentioned, but they are columns of
the atrium, which is discussed below, which the Lord ordered to put around the
tabernacle. Mentioned, then, the north and south sides of the tabernacle with
its twenty pillars each, the text continues saying: And behind the tabernacle,
on the part that looks west, you shall make six pillars; and for the angles of
the tabernacle, on its back, you will make two more columns, which will be
equal from top to bottom and will be joined together, being equal from the
capitals to the first union. You will do so with the two columns for the two
angles: they must be the same. They will be, then, eight columns with their
sixteen bases of silver: two bases for one column and other two bases for the
other column on each of their sides (Ex 26,22-25). About the bases the same
reason is given and the same expression is used. The west side, therefore -
this is the side that is said to face the sea - consists of eight columns: six
in the central part and two in the angles, which, as the text says, must be the
same in the direction of where they come together. I believe that the angle
joins two sides and the column of the angle is common to each side, one on the
west and north side, and one on the west and south side. With respect to what
is said that they must also be the same from top to bottom, it is said, of
course, to keep them in balance perpendicularly, so that they were not thicker
than down, as are most columns.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">7. Then go
on: You will also make crossbars of incorruptible wood: five for a pillar on
one side of the tabernacle and five crossbars for the pillar on the other side
of the tabernacle and five crossbars for the column on the back side of the
tabernacle, which faces the sea. It is striking that it can be doubted that the
eastern side of this inner tabernacle, around which the atrium then became, had
no columns. For it is ordered that each column of the three sides each have
five crossbars. The text says: The central crosspiece will pass halfway up the
columns from one end to the other (Ex 26,28). It seems to mean that the
crossbar should reach from one column to another and should extend through the
middle of the columns from one end to the other end; and for that reason, one
of all those columns should not have its own five crossbeams. To this last
column came the five, coming from the column next to it. The text says: You
shall make the pillars of gold and make gold rings in which you shall put the
crossbars, and put the crossbars of gold on them (Ex 26,29). So that the
columns were not filled with holes through which the crossbars were inserted,
it is ordered to make rings, in which the ends of the crossbars are held on
both sides. Therefore, it is necessary to think that these rings hung from

the crosspieces.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

continue: You will set up the tabernacle according to the model that has been
shown to you on the mountain. You shall make a veil of hyacinth and purple and
scarlet yarn and fine linen. You will do it embroidered with cherubs. You will
hang it from four columns of incorruptible wood covered with gold. Its capitals
shall be of gold and its four bases of silver. And you shall put the veil over
the pillars, and you shall put there, behind the veil, the ark of the covenant.
And the veil will serve you to separate the saint from the saint from the
saints. And you shall cover with the veil the ark of the covenant in the holy
of holies. All this shows that the ark of the covenant was inside, behind the
veil placed on four columns. And it is ordered to cover the ark with the veil,
but it must not be done so that the veil is placed on the cover of the ark, but
must be placed in front. Then it is added: And you shall put the table outside
the veil and the candlestick in front of the table in the part of the
tabernacle that looks at noon. You will put the table in the part of the
tabernacle that looks north (Ex 26,35). This is also clear. Then it is said:
And you shall make a curtain of hyacinth and purple and scarlet yarn and fine
twisted linen, work of embroiderer. And you shall make five pillars for the
veil and overlay them with gold. Its capitals will be gold. And you shall cast
for them five bronze bases (Ex 26,36.37). Later it will appear to what use this
veil extended over five columns was destined, because here it is not said. It
seems that it is the veil of the entrance to the tabernacle, that is, the inner
tabernacle, around which the atrium was located. Then the altar of sacrifices
and burnt offerings is commanded, and it is said how it is to be done. But it
still does not say where to put it. But this will also appear later.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">9. From
here until the end, the atrium is already spoken, which is to be placed around
the tabernacle on whose construction it was previously spoken. The text says
thus: You will also make the atrium (Cf Ex 27,9ss). In Greek it is called ailén
and they did not ailaían. Some of our translators do not distinguish between
this court and those tapestries, which the Greeks call ailaias, not ails, and
translate that word by "courts," saying, "You shall also make
the tabernacle with ten courtyards," 29 where they should say with ten tapestries.
Others, much more ignorant still, translated by ianuas (doors), not only ails,
but also ailaias. Now, as in Latin we have the Aulaea (tapestries), which the
Greeks call Ailaias, so our authors also call Aulam (classroom, palace) to what
the Greeks call Ailén. But in Latin with this word the atrium is no longer
indicated, but the royal palace: in Greek, on the other hand, the atrium is
indicated. The text says: You shall make the court for the tabernacle on the
side facing the south, and the curtain of the court shall be of fine twine. Its
length will be one hundred cubits on one side. Its pillars will be twenty and
its bronze bases will be twenty, and its rings and its rings will be of silver.
The side facing north will also have a curtain of one hundred cubits long. Its
pillars will be twenty and its brass bases will be twenty. Its rings and the
rings of the columns and the bases will be covered with silver. The width of
the atrium on the side facing the sea will have a curtain of fifty cubits. Its
columns will be ten and its bases will be ten. The width of the atrium on the
part facing east will be fifty cubits. His pillars will be ten and his bases
will be ten (Ex 27,9-13.).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">10. Here
we see already that the columns of the eastern part are mentioned, when
speaking of the atrium. And that those columns were ten with ten bronze bases,
as was also said about those on the west side. From here arises a very
difficult question. Because it is easy to understand that on the eastern side
there was an order of columns corresponding to the atrium, which surrounds on
its four sides the inner tabernacle, because this inner tabernacle had no
columns on that part. On the other hand, on the western side, where the eight
columns of the inner tabernacle were already located, how are these ten columns
to be understood also of the outer court, which is now mentioned, as if on the
west side there were two orders of columns, eight on the inside and ten on the
outside? And if the reality is like this, then the sides of the outer court
would also be longer than those of the inner tabernacle, so that there would be
a space from which the other order of columns would go from one end to the
other and not to give in the previous order corresponding to the inner
tabernacle. And if this is so, it would be logical that those twenty columns of
the two sides of the inner tabernacle, on the south side and on the north side,
were separated by shorter distances than those of the other twenty that the
outer court has by those same sides. And since those outer orders of the twenty
columns, as the Scripture says, have one hundred cubits, these inner orders of
as many columns as you wish would have fewer elbows. Since the Scripture has
not said it, it will be logical to think that those eight columns of the inner
tabernacle, located on the west side, would be more separated than the twenty
on the south side and the north side of the tabernacle itself, so that space
could be encompassed enough to spread around those ten tapestries, with which
the Lord had this tabernacle built at first. For each one of these tapestries
is twenty-eight cubits, which make a total of two hundred and eighty cubits.
Now, if there were a hundred cubits on the south and north sides, where the
orders of the twenty columns are, we would evidently have forty cubits on the
other two sides, the east and the west, and proportionally there would be at
eight columns forty cubits, as in the twenty columns there are one hundred
cubits. But the sides of the outer court would not be longer, because they are
bounded by a hundred cubits, and, therefore, there would be no way for that
order of ten columns, from the south angle to the north angle, to include the
order of eight. interior columns.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
for the atrium to surround the inner tabernacle on all sides, it is necessary
that it be also shorter. And so it would be necessary that its twenty pillars,
by means of which it extends along on both sides, be placed closer to each
other than there are the twenty columns of the outer court. And the eight
columns of the inner tabernacle on the west side should be more separated than
the ten on the same side of the outer court, because the smaller number of
elbows that have those tapestries extending along the twenty columns of the two
sides, towards the south and towards the north, it is necessary to compensate
it with the width of the east and west sides, to complete the measurement of
the two hundred and eighty cubits that the tapestries have. Because the Lord
did not order that some of these tapestries be folded, as he did with regard to
the veils of hairs, among which there is one more. Therefore, if only the
length of the inner tabernacle is reduced, which could be included from the
outer court, so that the columns of the tapestries would not extend into one
hundred columns, but only, for example, a minimum of ninety-six elbows, and
thus had four less elbows, these same four elbows, which in total would be
eight, would have to be placed naturally on the other two sides, the east side
and the west side. And so those eight pillars of the west of the inner
tabernacle would not measure forty cubits, but forty-four, and forty-four more
on the east side. Accordingly, since among the ten pillars of the outer court
they measure a length of fifty cubits, and between the eight pillars of the
inner tabernacle they measure a length of forty-four cubits, the intervals of
the eight inner pillars are more spaced than those of the ten pillars external,
because if they were equal, in the eight columns there would be forty cubits,
as there would be fifty cubits in the ten columns, because what are
proportionally eight to ten, are also forty to fifty, and five times eight is
forty, and five times ten fifty.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">11. And we
would not have any problem that the intervals of the columns were different,
that is, that they were closer together on the sides where there are twenty
columns along, and were more separated on the side where there are eight
columns as wide, if there were no other reason that forced us to change our
mind. For once it has been said that the court had curtains fifty cubits long
to the west and ten pillars and ten bases299 and that the width of the court to
the east was equally fifty cubits and had ten pillars and ten bases, it would
seem that , said these things, it would have finished describing the form of
the tabernacle with the atrium that surrounded it everywhere, but it is added
another thing that is very difficult to know where it was and how it should be
understood.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

reads as follows: The height of the curtain on one side will be fifteen cubits;
his columns will be three and his bases will be three. The height of the
curtain on the second side will be fifteen cubits; his columns will be three
and his bases will be three. The covering of the door of the vestibule will
have a height of twenty elbows; it will be of hyacinth and purple color and
fine scarlet and twisted linen, work of embroiderer. Its columns will be four
and its bases will be four (Ex 27,14-16). I do not see where these things could
be placed once the construction of the tabernacle is finished. But I see
clearly that it is the same number of columns, which are ten, distributed in
groups of three and three and four, that is, three on the sides and four in the
middle. And therefore those curtains of fifty cubits will not be joined, so
that there may be an entrance to the court, but the twenty cubits in the middle
shall be separated by the fifteen cubits, so that they form the covering of the
door of the tabernacle, that is, the veil, hang from an ornament and a cover
and occupy the space of four columns, intended for the door of the atrium and
which is separate. That is why the Lord established that this same veil,
divided by the sides of fifteen cubits and separated, was also distinguished by
its beauty, and highlighted by those four colors, work of embroiderer.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But those
sides of fifteen cubits on the one hand and on the other, which had three
pillars each, if they were joined in the straight line from the door of the
court, there would be no space between the ten pillars of the outer court and
the eight pillars of the tabernacle inside, where would be the square altar of
five cubits, which occupies the space that is not only in front of the altar,
where the altar would be served, but between the altar itself and the entrance
of the interior tabernacle where the brass pile would be. For the Lord
commanded that it be placed there for the priests to wash their hands and feet
when entering the tabernacle or when approaching to serve the altar. For if
this were not outside the tabernacle, in the court, how could they wash their
hands and feet before entering the tabernacle? But we can not put the altar
outside the court, because it was commanded that the tabernacle and the altar be
surrounded by the court. It remains, therefore, that those sides of fifteen
cubits on the one hand and on the other and of the triple columns we take them
from the sides, so that those sides form an interval of the same number of
cubits between the door of the atrium and the entrance of the inner tabernacle:
the door opened at the height of twenty cubits in the four columns with a veil
embroidered by the work of the embroiderer, twenty cubits; and the entrance of
the tabernacle so that the veil spread over the five pillars, which, evidently,
we can not believe was placed within that order of eight pillars, but outside,
next to the atrium.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Then you
will find the veil of the entrance. This entrance will open like a two-leaf
door. And there the tapestries were not joined together by the rings and rings.
Or if it were within that order of eight columns of the inner tabernacle, this
veil would be placed in front of the five pillars at the entrance of the
tabernacle so that when it was opened, the interior would not be exposed and
thus the people would not see it. spectators And that veil, already placed
within that order of columns, was already out - something that is not clear -
was undoubtedly something away from that order of columns so that the five
columns placed closer to the four columns would not close the entrance, but
rather hiding it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">12. Thus,
according to this model and this form of the tabernacle, there is no longer any
need to place those twenty columns closer to the south and north sides of the
inner tabernacle or to place those eight that looked west, further apart.
Because those ten from the outer court of the western part do not constitute a
long order of columns, in which the eight interiors are included, but, placed
on one side and on the other three and four close the space on the door where
the altar of burnt offerings, inside the door of the court, in front of the
entrance of the tabernacle, and the heap, between the entrance of the
tabernacle and the altar, and the space necessary for the ministry, between the
altar and the door of the court. And so, all that space of the atrium closes
with ten columns, three in the north and three in the south and four in the
west, as if the Greek letter pi were drawn. And so the longer order of columns
of the inner tabernacle added the same space, as if to the letter mentioned,
for the part that has nothing, was added the stroke of the letter that is
called iota; and thus, the middle part closes on that side and the remaining
parts of the iota remain on one side and on the other. In that long row of the
western part of the inner tabernacle could be counted, consequently, ten
columns, in order to add to those eight the last two of the north and south
rows of the sides of the atrium. For those ten that would properly belong to
the atrium on the west side, through which the tabernacle was entered, had
three columns on the sides and four on the facade, where the door was, and thus
understood the space necessary to make the sacrifices inside. from the
courtyard, in front of the tabernacle. And in the three pillars that were on
the sides, there were linen awnings of fifteen cubits. In the four columns,
where the door was, there was a veil of twenty cubits embroidered by a work of
embroidery.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">13. The
Scripture should not pose a problem: The height of the curtains on one side
will be fifteen cubits: their columns will be three and their bases will be
three. The height of the curtains on the second side will be fifteen cubits:
their columns will be three and their bases will be three. The tapestry of the
door of the vestibule will have a height of twenty elbows (Ex 27,14-16.).
Because the text says that the height is the same as the length of the
curtains. In effect, the height, when they are woven, is the same as the
length, when they are extended. And so that it does not seem that we suspect
it, the Scripture remembers this same thing in another place, when it says:
They also made the vestibule that watches towards the south: the curtains of
the vestibule were of twisted linen, of one hundred elbows by one hundred
elbows (Ex 38,9 (37, 7)), that is to say, one hundred cubits of the curtains
for the hundred cubits of space that supported the twenty columns. And then he
continues: And his pillars were twenty, and his bases, of brass, were twenty.
The side facing north was one hundred cubits by a hundred cubits: and its
pillars were twenty, and its bases were twenty bronze. And the side facing the
sea had a tapestry of fifty cubits: its pillars were ten, and its bases were
ten (Ex 38,8-10 (37, 10-12)). - Here it is called a tapestry to what was
previously called curtains. And the side facing east had curtains of fifty
cubits (Ex 38,11 (37,13)). After these data, the back of the tabernacle is
again spoken of to show how those ten columns covered the space of the
aforementioned atrium. The text reads as follows: Fifteen cubits from the back
(Ex 38,12 (37,14)). It is called back, because it was the back of the
tabernacle, the western part. And he continues: And his pillars were three and
his bases were three. And on the second side of the back, on either side of the
door of the court, there was a tapestry of fifteen cubits: its pillars were
three and its sockets were three (Ex 38,13 (37, 13)). It is totally clear that
what is here called back parts, when describing the way in which all things are
made, corresponds to what were called sides, when the Lord gave the order to
make them. They are sides, because united on either side they closed the space
of the vestibule of the western door, or they are parts of behind, because they
were for the back of the tabernacle, on the western part, this part of the
atrium. Then the text continues: All the tapestries of the atrium were of
twined linen. The bases of the pillars were of bronze, and the rings of silver,
and their capitals clad in silver, and all the pillars of the court were lined
with silver. And then he adds what had not yet been mentioned in this place:
And the veil of the door of the porch, work of embroiderer, was of hyacinth and
purple, and pure scarlet and twisted linen, and had a length and a height of twenty
cubits. . This is where it appears that the height mentioned above is the same
as the length of the extended tapestries. Finally he adds: And the width of
five cubits. Indeed, the curtains of the outer court were as many cubits wide
as the four cubits of the inner court. For it had been said thus: the length of
the court shall be one hundred cubits, a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty
cubits, fifty cubits, and the height five cubits. It will be linen torzal (Ex
27,18). Now what is called width is called height, because what is width for
those who are extended is height for those who are standing. Well, as I just
said, what is height when they are woven is length when they are extended.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">14. Let us
now see what I had left aside, that is, how to resolve the difficulty of the
veils of hair, once I have explained, as I could, the shape of the tabernacle,
putting it before the eyes. This question was perhaps more abstruse, because
the author said in advance something that would be useful for the work of which
he was going to speak later, when describing the atrium that had to be built
around the tabernacle. Let us now see, then, the very words of the text: You
will spread what is above the veils of the tabernacle; the half that you will
spread over the veil; you will spread it over the tabernacle veils behind the
tabernacle (Ex 26,12). All that is said has only one meaning: "the half
that is above the veil", that is, "what is above the veils of the
tabernacle that must be extended behind the tabernacle". Now it is necessary
to investigate how it remains, how it exceeds and half of the veil of that
series of veils is united, since the Lord commanded to join five to each other
and another six to each other, as he had said before that the sixth veil had to
be folded in front of the veil. tabernacle, that is, on the east side. And as
the Lord said that they were the same ones in the back of the tabernacle, on
the west side, which is the sea side, what is the front of the tabernacle, but
the side facing east? </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
that part by which the five veils are joined is one hundred and fifty cubits,
that is, five times thirty-for each veil was thirty cubits, as God had
commanded them to be made. But that part in which there were not five, but six
veils, joined together in the same way, was one hundred and eighty cubits,
this, six times thirty. And so, when they folded one of these veils, as it was
commanded, they lost with the fold fifteen cubits before the tabernacle. And
removing these fifteen cubits, there remained one hundred and sixty-five.
Consequently, from those one hundred and fifty cubits, by means of which this
part of the six veils was also equal to that part of the five veils, there
remained and there were still fifteen cubits left. For on the side of the part
of the five veils there were one hundred and fifty cubits. And on the side of
the part of the six veils, folding one in front of the tabernacle, there were
one hundred and sixty-five cubits. This side, therefore, had fifteen cubits
more than the other. This is what the author calls the half of the veil, which
he orders to extend behind the tabernacle. Therefore, since that is bent
before, this half veil left over from the back of the tabernacle did not bend,
but extended. That is to say, all those fifteen cubits placed underneath
extended, and for that reason they were subtracted to that length. And they
also subtracted, by the fold of one of the veils, those fifteen cubits before
the tabernacle. Thus, at the one hundred and fifty cubits of the five veils
were opposed by the other party the one hundred and fifty cubits of the six
veils, that is, the thirty cubits subtracted from the one hundred and eighty
that were before the tabernacle, with the veil bent, and from the back parts of
the tabernacle, with half the veil spread below.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">15. What
follows is something else and raises another problem, because of which, above
all, I thought that we had to delay the explanation of this passage, so that we
could first see the shape of the tabernacle that was going to be built and what
was written about the atrium that had to be built around. Then the text
follows: What is left over from the veils of the length of the tabernacle
veils-one cubit on the one hand and the other on the other-will be spread on
both sides of the tabernacle, from one side to the other, to cover it. It is
one thing that one part of the six veils will overcome the other part of the
five veils because of the greater number of veils, of which we have already
spoken, and another thing is that there is something left over from the length
of the veils, that has now been spoken. According to this, one does not compare
one part with another nor is it discovered that one is greater than the other,
that is, that which has six veils is greater than that which has five veils.
For the two sides were equal to each other, a veil was folded in front of the
tabernacle, and the length of half a veil was extended from behind. But the
veils of hairs, compared with the tapestries, of which the Lord commanded to
make ten for the inner tabernacle, woven with four colors, are two elbows
longer, because each tapestry was twenty-eight cubits, and the veils were
thirty cubits.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
here it is not said: what is left over from the veils, but what is left over
from the veils of the length of the veils. And the phrase: An elbow on one side
and another elbow on the other will extend on both sides of the tabernacle, it
means that the length in which the veils of hair exceed in two elbows each of
the tapestries -each one of them, not all-, it has to be collected towards a
part, that is to say, what remains must be collected towards the back of the
tabernacle, but distributing it equally and giving the same amount to the
anterior part of the tabernacle as to the back. This means that, as the two
elbows in each of the veils have the same length that they have left, one part
must remove one elbow and the other part, another elbow. Thus, this part will
have ten cubits from each of its veils and the other part another ten cubits
from each of its own, because the ten veils, each with two more elbows, have a
length of twenty cubits, by which they seem to exceed in their series the
series of tapestries.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">16. Now we
must see what space they serve to close these twenty cubits that are left over
from the length of the veils. Because if the inner tabernacle is covered around
by the veils of hair, there is absolutely nothing left so that it can be
covered with them. From where it turns out that they themselves have to be
covered underneath, and by covering them underneath, something must be taken
from them, something that the Scripture does not say. In fact, the ten
tapestries, each one of which has twenty-eight cubits, with which the inner
tabernacle is covered, cover a space of dimensions that can cover two hundred
and eighty cubits. Therefore, the longer sides, which are the south and the
north, each having twenty columns, lose one cubit each of those elbows. Eighty
remain to distribute, forty on each of the other two shorter sides, the eastern
side, which lacks the row of columns, and the western side, where there were
eight columns. Therefore, the veils of hair would have twenty cubits left over,
which would have nothing to cover, if with the three hundred cubits of the
veils of hair the two hundred and eighty cubits of the tapestries were covered,
since when removing the veils from them thirty cubits, they would still have
three hundred. Therefore, those two elbows that have more each one of the veils
of hairs, and whose sum of twenty elbows, it is necessary to distribute them
thus: an elbow on the one hand and another elbow on the other. This means that
you do not have to collect all of them in a single part so that they cover the
sides of the tabernacle, but they must cover the sides of the outer court.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Thus,
those three hundred cubits of veils of hair must surround the tabernacle on the
outside. Then the sides of the outer court of a hundred cubits, which are the
south and north sides, are over fifty cubits on the east and west sides, all of
which together make three hundred cubits, to cover which are three hundred
cubits the veils of hairs. This is what it means: one elbow on the one hand and
another elbow on the other. It is about the distribution of the two elbows that
have more each of the hair veils, that is, what is left over from the veils of
the length of the veils will extend to both sides of the tabernacle, the sides,
obviously, external, belonging to the atrium, to cover on both sides, and not
the sides of the atrium itself, which extend along one hundred cubits each and
twenty columns each. These sides, in fact, have not become longer than those of
the inner tabernacle, which extend throughout the ten tapestries, and they
themselves have also twenty pillars each. For as the two sides of the inner
tabernacle, on the north and on the south, have one hundred cubits each, so do
those of the outer court.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
the length with which they exceed the length of the carpets does not serve to
cover the own outer sides of as many columns of the hair veils. Because toward
the outer sides they measure the same as they would measure toward the
interior, that is, one hundred cubits each, which make two hundred. But, as on
the east and west sides, forty-cubits-long sides would suffice if only the
inner tabernacle were surrounded with the veils of hairs, so the width of the
tabernacle increased once the sides of the court were added, so that no longer
forty cubits are needed to cover the east and west sides, but fifty cubits. To
cover them, the length of the hairs of hairs could be greater than that of the
tapestries, so that the two elbows that were left over to each of them were not
used on the one hand, but an elbow was used on the one hand and elbow on the
other. on the other; and so the eastern side had as much as ten cubits left,
and the western side ten more. Because twenty corresponds to twice ten, since
the thirty cubits of the eleventh veil are subtracted from this length, by
folding it and extending it below.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">17. But as
the Latin translation says: One cubit on the one hand and another cubit on the
other of what is left over the veils of the length of the veils of the
tabernacle shall extend on both sides of the tabernacle, (Ex 26,13) where the
Greek has plágia, a term that some Latin translators translate not by
"sides" (side), but by "obliques" (obliqua), the question
arises of knowing why they can not be called "plagia" those sides, of
which one is before and one behind, that they are the sides of the east and the
west, but they can be called piazza on the right and on the left, which are the
north and south sides, although nothing oblique appears here, since all the
angles of the four sides are straight . Therefore, not being those pages that
have fifty cubits each, to cover which we said could have served the length of
the veils of hair that was left over, how can it be true that one elbow on one
side and another elbow on the other? What is left of the veils of the length of
the veils of the tabernacle shall extend on both sides of the tabernacle? It is
evident that the author speaks of covering those sides -which he also calls
parts of the back-, of fifteen cubits each and of three columns each, which,
together with the door of the vestibule, which has twenty elbows and four
columns, make fifty cubits and ten columns. These sides leave the atrium door
in the middle from these own limits of their own, and leave the entrance of the
tabernacle from those limits. Between the door of the court and the entrance of
the tabernacle there is a space that those twenty cubits close from the door
and fifteen cubits each from the right and from the left. In that space is the
altar of burnt offerings inside the door of the atrium in front of the entrance
of the tabernacle. Between the altar and the entrance of the tabernacle is the
bronze basin, where the priests washed their hands and feet.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Examined,
however, with care, perhaps even some obliquity is found on these sides of
three columns each, which in Greek is called plagia, so that with good reason
some of our translators have translated by obliqua (oblique) the word plágia
that they found in Greek. Indeed, the veils of hairs, with their fifteen cubits
each, can not cover the fifteen cubits of each one of the awnings of those
sides, unless in the later parts of the tabernacle no more than ten cubits are
used in each one, before they bend to those sides. Therefore, from the straight
line of the back of the tabernacle, which is the part of the west-as this line
had eight columns, corresponding to the inner tabernacle, it began to have ten
when the sides of the outer court were added to it, and as it had Forty cubits,
corresponding to the eight columns, began to have fifty cubits in the ten
columns - from this line, then, as the ten cubits that came from the two angles
were covered with the veils of hair, there will be thirty cubits in the middle
not covered with the veils of hairs, but only in those tapestries in whose
half, which was thirty cubits and extending by as many elbows, was the entrance
of the tabernacle.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Therefore,
those sides that had three columns and fifteen cubits, if considered from their
terminations, by which the doors of the atrium were joined, were opened face to
face at a distance of twenty cubits, because there was only one door that I
separated those sides. But from the terminations, by which they were attached
to that later line of the tabernacle, of which we have spoken, there were
thirty cubits between them, no doubt oblique, because they opened more than
others, on this side, where they had thirty cubits, up to the middle, that by
that one for which they had twenty cubits, up to the middle. Thus, those ten
cubits of the veils of hairs -which was half the length that remained-, which
served for the back of the tabernacle, the western part, as the other ten
served for the previous part, the eastern part with five cubits filled the
cover of those sides, which in Greek are called piagia, five on the one hand
and five on the other. And if they had missed those elbows, on those same sides
ten cubits would be covered and five cubits would be uncovered. Therefore, it seems
to me that it is better understood that it has been said: One elbow on the one
hand and another elbow on the other of what is left over to the veils of the
length of the veils of the tabernacle, not because they were there, five times
one part and the other, but because they exceeded that length, according to
which the veils of hair exceeded in two elbows the tapestries. And of those two
elbows, the elbow of each of the veils served for the eastern part. And there
was certainly another elbow for the western part, so that one elbow on the one
hand and another elbow on the other covered the pages of the tabernacle. That
is why it is said: so that it may spread on one side and on the other; since it
did not cover everything, if they had missed the five mentioned elbows.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">18. Now,
as we have already discussed a lot about how to understand all those things
that seemed obscure in the construction of the tabernacle, we will try to show
briefly, as far as possible, what we have got out of this discussion. The entrance
was from the west and there was a first entrance door to the court, which was
twenty cubits wide and four columns, from which hung a veil, twenty cubits wide
and five cubits high, of cloth embroidered and colored with those four colors
mentioned so many times. Entering through this door, one went to the atrium,
which had on the right side and on the left fifteen cubits long and three
columns on each side. In the middle was the entrance of the inner tabernacle in
that part where it was reached. In the same way, in the middle the door of the
atrium was located in that part where it was starting to go. This atrium was
wider than long. Its length, from the door of it to the entrance of the inner
tabernacle, was about fifteen cubits. Its width, on the other hand, near the
door was twenty cubits, and thirty cubits near the entrance. Thus it is
understood that those sides were oblique. And they had, on the right and on the
left, three columns each and fifteen cubits each.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In this
court was the sacrificial altar, square in shape, five cubits long and five
cubits wide. Between the door and the altar there was a space, where those who
put the sacrifices on the altar moved. On the inside, between the altar and the
entrance to the tabernacle, was the place of the ashes before the altar and
then the bronze pile, where the priests washed their hands and feet, or because
they were going to serve the altar in the atrium, or because they were going to
enter the inner tabernacle. The awnings of this court on the sides of the three
pillars were of linen fifteen cubits wide and five cubits high.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">19. From
this vestibule one went to the entrance of the tabernacle, once left behind the
altar and the bronze pile. It happened with the tapestries open, ten of which,
five on the one hand and five on the other, surrounded the entire inner
tabernacle, placed facing each other. Upon entering through the door was the
veil that was in front of the entrance, hanging on five columns, and adorned
with those four colors. When the Lord commanded to make this veil he called it
adductorium (Ex 26,36) (curtain), I think because it was running in both
directions, covering and opening the entrance. After this veil came the middle
part of the tabernacle, located between this veil and that other inner veil,
which hung from four columns, made with those four colors and that separated
the saint, who was on the outside, and the saint of the saints, located inside.
In this middle space, between these two veils, there was a table of gold, in
the northern part, which had the loaves of the proposal, and in front of it the
seven-armed golden candelabra, in the southern part. Up to here the priests of
the second rank could enter.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">20. In the
inner part, in the saint of the saints, beyond the veil that hung from the four
pillars, was the ark of the golden covenant, on which were the tablets of the
law and the rod of Aaron, and the golden urn with the manna, and above the
golden mercy seat, where the two cherubim were, covering with their wings the
mercy seat, facing each other. In front of the ark, between the ark and the
veil, was placed the altar of incense, that the Scripture says many times that
it was of gold, and other times, that it was golden, calling clearly of gold to
a thing that was golden. To this place, the saint of saints, only the high
priest could enter, every day to put the incense, and once a year with the
blood to purify the altar, and if perhaps the need to offer a sacrifice for the
sin of the priest or of the whole community, as it is written in Leviticus (Cf
Lv 16). The tabernacle was entered by the west gate, that is, by the door of
the court to the east side, by the inside, where the ark of the covenant was.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">21. This
inner tabernacle, which began, not from the door of the court, but from the
entrance which was called the entrance of the tabernacle, and which ended along
the eastern side, where the ark of the covenant was, ended at the ten
tapestries which each had twenty-eight cubits, five on one side and five on the
other, joined together by rings and rings, and which were placed opposite each
other, and in the twenty columns on the longer sides, north and south. south,
and in the eight columns, on the west side, and that on the east side had no
columns, but ended in tapestries. These ten tapestries were four cubits high
and two hundred and eighty cubits long all around. Of these, one hundred cubits
corresponded to the longer sides, south and north, along the twenty columns.
And forty cubits corresponded to the other two shorter sides, one to the west,
along eight columns, and another to the east, where there were no pillars, for
the tapestries hung alone from the only two columns that were in the corners,
there being no columns in between. These tapestries were ten fabrics with
fabrics of those four colors. This inner tabernacle was, therefore, surrounded
by the atrium of twenty columns, on the south, and of twenty others, on the
north. These two sides of the court were equal in length to the sides of the
inner tabernacle, since they had twenty pillars and the same number of cubits,
which were one hundred. On the east side, however, the atrium ended in ten
columns and was fifty cubits. This line of columns was straight and ended in
those two angular columns of the inner tabernacle, which were the only ones on
the east side. With them, therefore, the number of ten was completed. On the
west side, however, the atrium certainly had ten columns, but not in a straight
line, but, as we have already shown, in the form of a triple portico, with four
columns from the door and three from the sides.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">22. All
the court that surrounded the tabernacle was surrounded by awnings of fine
linen, five cubits high. On them fell the eleven veils of goat's hair, five on
one side joined together, and six on the other. The five veils bound together
on one side measured one hundred and fifty cubits. The six joined veils of the
other side measured one hundred and eighty cubits, because each veil measured
thirty cubits. But for one part to be equal to the other, a veil was folded in
front of the tabernacle, that is, on the east side, and half of the veil was
tucked under the back, that is, on the west side, and thus they removed thirty
cubits, which was the length of a veil, and there remained one hundred and
fifty cubits, the same as there was also on the other side. The circumference,
then, of the goats' hair, which surrounded the court of the tabernacle, was
three hundred cubits, as the circumference of the ten tabernacles of the inner
tabernacle measured two hundred and eighty cubits, since each tapestry was
twenty-eight cubits long, and, instead, the veils of hairs were thirty cubits
long. Therefore, from the circumference of the tapestries of the inner
tabernacle, which measured two hundred and eighty cubits, the elbows were on
the longer sides, south and north, and forty cubits on the shorter sides, east
and west.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">On the
other hand, of the circumference of the hairs, which covered the outer court
and whose circumference measured three hundred cubits, one hundred cubits were
on the longer sides, of the south and north, because they were equal to the
sides of the inner tabernacle, and fifty cubits were on the remaining sides,
east and west. And therefore, those two elbows in which the veil of hair was
longer than the tapestry served for the east and west sides and not for the
south and north sides, which were equal to those of the outer court and the
outer court. inner tabernacle. And the reason is that on those two sides the
width of the tabernacle had increased in relation to the atrium placed around
the outside. But the fifty cubits of the veils of hairs extended from the
eastern part by the straight line formed by the ten columns and took advantage
of one elbow of those two in which the length of the veils of hairs was greater.
On the other hand, the other fifty cubits that corresponded to the west side,
to which the other elbow of those two took advantage, did not extend by the
straight line of the columns. Because there was that kind of triple portico,
which closed the space of the atrium, where the altar of sacrifices should be,
formed by four columns from the door and three from the sides. And therefore
those fifty cubits could not also close the door, but extended to cover those
oblique sides, formed by three columns and fifteen cubits. The veils of hairs
measured four cubits high and with them covered the linen awnings of the
atrium, whose height was five cubits.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">23. The
skins dyed red came to fall on the veils of goat hair. But above, on the part
of the roof, forming a kind of vault, the tabernacle was covered with
hyacinth-colored skins. It is not clear if that space was also that interior
with the atrium. But it is more plausible that the spaces of the atrium, which
were between the outer and inner columns, were flat ceilings, especially the
western space, where the altar of sacrifices was located.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

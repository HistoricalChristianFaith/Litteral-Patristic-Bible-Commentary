<p><strong><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matt. XII. 1</font></u></a>.</strong></p>
<p><q><em>At that time Jesus went on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a> through the grain; and His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> were a hungered, and began to pluck the</em> <em><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200139.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ears</font></u></a> of grain, and to eat.</em></q></p>
<p>But Luke says, <q>On a double <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>.</q> Now what is a double <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>? When the cessation from toil is twofold, both that of the regular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, and that of another feast coming upon it. For they call every cessation from toil, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sabbath</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But why could He have led them away from it, who foreknew all, unless it had been His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> should be broken? It was His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> indeed, but not simply so; wherefore He never breaks it without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, but giving reasonable excuses: that He might at once bring the law to an end, and not startle them. But there are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200139.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">occasions</font></u></a> on which He even repeals it directly, and not with circumstance: as when He anoints with the clay the eyes of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200139.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blind man</font></u></a>; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh009.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 9:6, 14</font></u></a></span> as when He says, <q>My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200139.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father works</font></u></a> hitherto, and I work.</q> And He does so, by this to glorify His own Father, by the other to soothe the infirmity of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. At which last He is laboring here, putting forward as a plea the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of nature; although in the case of acknowledged <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, that could not of course ever be an excuse. For neither may the murderer make his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> a plea, nor the adulterer allege his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, no, nor any other excuse; but here, by mentioning their hunger, He freed them from all blame.</p>
<p>But do thou, I pray you, admire the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, how entirely they control themselves, and make no account of the things of the body, but esteem the table of the flesh a secondary thing, and though they have to struggle with continual hunger, do not even so withdraw themselves. For except hunger had sorely constrained them, they would not have done so much as this.</p>
<p>What then do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>? <q>When they saw it,</q> it is said, <q>they said unto Him, Behold, Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> do that which is not lawful to do upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:2</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Now here indeed with no great vehemence (yet surely that would have been consistent in them)—nevertheless they are not vehemently provoked, but simply find fault. But when He stretched out the withered hand and healed it, then they were so infuriated, as even to consult together about slaying and destroying Him. For where nothing great and noble is done, they are calm; but where they see any made whole, they are savage, and fret themselves, and none so intolerable as they are: such enemies are they of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of men.</p>
<p>How then does Jesus defend His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>? <q>Have ye not read,</q> says He, <q>what David did in the temple, when he was an hungered, himself and all they that were with him? How he entered into the house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and did eat the show-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:3-4</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Thus, whereas in pleading for His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, He brings forward David; for Himself, it is the Father. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:17</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And observe His reproving manner: <q>Have ye not read what David did?</q> For great indeed was that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, so that Peter also afterwards pleading with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, spoke on this wise, <q>Let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:29</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>But wherefore does He not call him by the name of his rank, either on this occasion or afterwards? Perhaps because He derived His race from him.</p>
<p>Now had they been a candid sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, He would have turned His discourse to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples'</font></u></a> suffering from hunger; but abominable as they were and inhuman, He rather rehearses unto them a history.</p>
<p>But Mark says, <q>In the days of Abiathar the High Priest:</q> not stating what was con trary to the history, but implying that he had two names; and adds that <q>he gave unto him,</q> indicating that herein also David had much to say for himself, since even the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> suffered him; and not only suffered, but even ministered unto him. For tell me not that David was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, for not even so was it lawful, but the privilege was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>': wherefore also He added, <q>but for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> only.</q> For though he were ten thousand times a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, yet was he not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>; and though he were himself a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, yet not so they that were with him; since to them too we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that he gave.</p>
<p><q>What then,</q> it might be said, <q>were they all one with David?</q> Why talk to me of dignity, where there seems to be a transgression of the law, even though it be the constraint of nature? Yea, and in this way too He has the more entirely acquitted them of the charges, in that he who is greater is found to have done the same.</p>
<p><q>And what is this to the question,</q> one may say; <q>for it was not surely the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, that he transgressed?</q> Thou tellest me of that which is greater, and which especially shows the wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, that letting go the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, He brings another example greater than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>. For it is by no means the same, to break in upon a day, and to touch that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> table, which it was not lawful for any man to touch. Since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> indeed has been violated, and that often; nay rather it is continually being violated, both by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, and by many other works; and at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08339a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jericho</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jos006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Joshua 6:15</font></u></a></span> too one may see the same to have happened; but this happened then only. So that He more than obtains the victory. How then did no man blame David, although there was yet another ground of charge heavier than this, that of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests'</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, which had its origin from this? But He states it not, as applying himself to the present subject only.</p>
<p>2. Afterwards again He refutes it in another way also. For as at first He brought in David, by the dignity of the person quelling their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>; so when He had stopped their mouths, and had put down their boasting, then He adds also the more appropriate refutation. And of what sort is this? <q>Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, that in the temple the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> profane the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, and are blameless?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:5</font></u></a></span> For in that other instance indeed, says He, the emergency made the relaxation, but here is the relaxation even without emergency. He did not however at once thus refute them but first by way of permission, afterwards as insisting upon his argument. Because it was meet to draw the stronger inference last, although the former argument also had of course its proper weight.</p>
<p>For tell me not, that it is not freeing one's self from blame, to bring forward another who is committing the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. For when the doer incurs no blame, the act on which he has ventured becomes a rule for others to plead.</p>
<p>Nevertheless He was not satisfied with this, but subjoins also what is more decisive, saying that the deed is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> at all; and this more than anything was the sign of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> victory, to point to the law repealing itself, and in two ways doing so, first by the place, then by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>; or rather even in three ways, in that both the work is twofold that is done, and with it goes also another thing, its being done by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>; and what is yet more, that it is not even brought as a charge. <q>For they,</q> says He, <q>are blameless.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how many points He has stated? The place; for He says, <q>In the temple;</q> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, for they are <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>;</q> the time, for He says, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>;</q> the act itself, for <q>they profane;</q> (He not having said, <q>they break,</q> but what is more grievous, <q>they profane;</q>) that they not only escape punishment, but are even free from blame, <q>for they,</q> says He, <q>are blameless.</q></p>
<p>Do not ye therefore account this, He says, like the former instance. For that indeed was done both but once, and not by a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, and was of necessity; wherefore also they were deserving of excuse; but this last is both done every <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, and by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, and in the temple, and according to the law. And therefore again not by favor, but in a legal way, they are acquitted of the charges. For not at all as blaming them did I so speak, says He, nor yet as freeing them from blame in the way of indulgence, but according to the principle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And He seems indeed to be defending them, but it is His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> whom He is clearing of the alleged faults. For when He says, <q>those are blameless,</q> He means, <q>much more are these.</q></p>
<p><q>But they are not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>.</q> Nay, they are greater than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>. For the Lord of the temple Himself is here: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, not the type. Wherefore He said also,</p>
<p><q>But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.</q> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, great as the sayings were which they heard, they made no reply, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of men was not their object.</p>
<p>Then, because to the hearers it would seem harsh, He quickly draws a veil over it, giving His discourse, as before, a lenient turn, yet even so expressing Himself with a rebuke. <q>But if you had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> what this means, I will have mercy and not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:7</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see how again He inclines His speech to lenity, yet again shows them to be out of the reach of lenity? <q>For you would not have condemned,</q> says He, <q>the guiltless.</q> Before indeed He inferred the same from what is said of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, in the words, <q>they are guiltless;</q> but here He states it on His own authority; or rather, this too is out of the law, for He was quoting a prophetic saying. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/hos006.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hosea 6:6</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>3. After this He mentions another reason likewise; <q>For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of man</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>is Lord of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a>;</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:8</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>speaking it of Himself. But Mark relates Him to have said this of our common nature also; for He said, <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> was made for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, not man for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar002.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 2:27</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Wherefore then was he punished that was gathering the sticks? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num015.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 15:32-36</font></u></a></span> Because if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> were to be despised even at the beginning, of course they would scarcely be observed afterwards.</p>
<p>For indeed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> did at the first confer many and great benefits; for instance, it made them gentle towards those of their household, and humane; it taught them God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> and the creation, as Ezekiel says; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze020.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 20:12</font></u></a></span> it trained them by degrees to abstain from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, and disposed them to regard the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>For because they could not have borne it, if when He was giving the law for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, He had said, <q>Do your good works on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, but do not the works which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>,</q> therefore He restrained them from all alike for, <q>You must do nothing at all,</q> says He: and not even so were they kept in order. But He Himself, in the very act of giving the law of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, did even therein darkly signify that He will have them refrain from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> works only, by the saying, <q>You must do no work, except what shall be done for your life.</q> And in the temple too all went on, and with more diligence and double toil. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num028.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 28:9-10</font></u></a></span> Thus even by the very shadow He was secretly opening unto them the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Did Christ then, it will be said, repeal a thing so highly profitable? Far from it; nay, He greatly enhanced it. For it was time for them to be trained in all things by the higher rules, and it was unnecessary that his hands should be bound, who was freed from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, winged for all good works; or that men should hereby learn that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> made all things; or that they should so be made gentle, who are called to imitate God's own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> (for He says, <q>Be merciful, as your Heavenly Father</q>); <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk006.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 6:36</font></u></a></span> or that they should make one day a festival, who are commanded to keep a feast all their life long; (<q>For let us keep the feast,</q> it is said, <q>not with old leaven, neither with leaven of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>; but with unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a></q>); <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 5:8</font></u></a></span> as neither need they stand by an ark and a golden altar, who have the very Lord of all for their inmate, and in all things hold communion with Him; by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, and by oblation, and by scriptures, and by almsgiving, and by having Him within them. Lo now, why is any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> required, by him who is always keeping the feast, whose conversation is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>4. Let us keep the feast then continually, and do no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thing; for this is a feast: and let our spiritual things be made intense, while our earthly things give place: and let us rest a spiritual rest, refraining our hands from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>; withdrawing our body from our superfluous and unprofitable toils, from such as the people of the Hebrews did of old endure in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>. For there is no difference between us who are gathering gold, and those that were bound in the mire, working at those bricks, and gathering stubble, and being beaten. Yea, for now too the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> bids us make bricks, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a> did then. For what else is gold, than mire? And what else is silver, than stubble? Like stubble, at least, it kindles the flame of desire; like mire, so does gold defile him that possesses it.</p>
<p>Wherefore He sent us, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> from the wilderness, but His Son from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>. If then, after He has come, thou abide in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, you will suffer with the Egyptians: but if leaving that land thou go up with the spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, you shall see all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Yet not even this suffices for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. For we must not only be delivered out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, but we must also enter into the promise. Since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> too, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, both went through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12688a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Red Sea</font></u></a>, and ate manna, and drank spiritual drink, but nevertheless they all perished.</p>
<p>Lest then the same befall us also, let us not be slow, neither draw back; but when you hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> spies even now bringing up an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report against the strait and narrow way, and uttering the same kind of talk as those spies of old, let not the multitude, but Joshua, be our pattern, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh; and do not thou give up, until thou have attained the promise, and entered into the Heavens.</p>
<p>Neither account the journey to be difficult. <q>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:10</font></u></a></span> <q>But this way,</q> it will be said, <q>is strait and narrow.</q> Well, but the former, through which you have come, is not strait and narrow only, but even impassable, and full of savage wild beasts. And as there was no passing through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12688a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Red Sea</font></u></a>, unless that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> had been wrought, so neither could we, abiding in our former life, have gone up into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, but only by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> intervening. Now if the impossible has become possible, much more will the difficult be easy.</p>
<p><q>But that,</q> it will be said, <q>was of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> only.</q> Why, for this reason especially you have just <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to take <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a>. For if, where it was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> alone, He wrought with you; will He not much more be your aid, where ye also show forth laborious works? If He saved you, doing nothing, will He not much more help you, working?</p>
<p>Above indeed I was saying, that from the impossibilities you ought to take <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> about the difficulties also; but now I add this, that if we are vigilant, these will not be so much as difficult. For mark it: death is trodden under foot, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> has fallen, the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is extinguished, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit is given, life is contracted into a small space, the heavy burdens are abridged.</p>
<p>And to convince you hereof by the actual results, see how many have overshot the injunctions of Christ; and are you afraid of that which is just their measure? What plea then will you have, when others are leaping beyond the bounds, and you yourself too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a> for what is enacted?</p>
<p>Thus, you we admonish to give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> of such things as you have, but another has even stripped himself of all his possessions: you we require to live chastely with your wife, but another has not so much as entered into marriage: and you we entreat not to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, but another we find giving up even his own life for charity: you again we entreat to be lenient in judgments, and not severe to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, but another, even when smitten, has turned the other cheek also.</p>
<p>What then shall we say, I pray you? What excuse shall we make, not doing even these things, when others go so far beyond us? And they would not have gone beyond us, had not the thing been very easy. For which pines away, he who envies other men's blessings, or he who takes pleasure with them, and rejoices? Which eyes all things with suspicion and continual trembling, the chaste man, or the adulterer? Which is cheered by good hopes, he that spoils by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, or he that shows mercy, and imparts of his own to the needy?</p>
<p>Let us then bear in mind these things, and not be torpid in our career for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue's</font></u></a> sake; but having stripped ourselves with all readiness for these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> wrestlings, let us labor for a little while, that we may win the perpetual and imperishable crowns; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

And the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelists</font></u></a> indeed say, that He <q>set</q> the man <q>in the midst,</q> and asked them, <q>If it was lawful to do good on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days.</q> </p>
<p>See the tender bowels of the Lord. <q>He set him in the midst,</q> that by the sight He might subdue them; that overcome by the spectacle they might cast away their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, and out of a kind of shame towards the man, cease from their savage ways. But they, ungentle and inhuman, choose rather to hurt the fame of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, than to see this person made whole: in both ways betraying their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>; by their warring against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and by their doing so with such contentiousness, as even to treat with despite His mercies to other men.</p>
<p>And while the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelists</font></u></a> say, He asked the question, this one says, it was asked of Him. <q>And they asked Him,</q> so it stands, <q>saying, Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days? That they might accuse Him.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:10</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And it is likely that both took place. For being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unholy</font></u></a> wretches, and well assured that He would doubtless proceed to the healing, they hastened to take Him beforehand with their question, thinking in this way to hinder Him. And this is why they asked, <q>Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days?</q> not for information, but that <q>they might accuse Him.</q> Yet surely the work was enough, if it were really their wish to accuse Him; but they desired to find a handle in His words too, preparing for themselves beforehand an abundance of arguments.</p>
<p>But He in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man does this also: He answers them, teaching His own meekness, and turning it all back upon them; and points out their inhumanity. And He <q>sets</q> the man <q>in the midst;</q> not in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of them, but endeavoring to profit them, and move them to pity.</p>
<p>But when not even so did He prevail with them, then was He grieved, it is said, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> with them for the hardness of their heart, and He says,</p>
<p><q>What man is there among you that shall have one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200140.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sheep</font></u></a>, and if this fall into a pit on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days, will he not lay hold of it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>

<p>Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of accusing him again of transgression, He convicts them by this example. And do thou mark, I pray you, how variously and suitably in each case, He introduces His pleas for the breaking of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sabbath</font></u></a>. Thus, first, in the case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200140.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blind man</font></u></a>, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh009.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 9:6</font></u></a></span> He does not so much as defend Himself to them, when He made the clay: and yet then also were they blaming Him; but the manner of the creation was enough to indicate the Lord and Owner of the law. Next, in the case of the paralytic, when he carried his bed, and they were finding fault, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:9-10</font></u></a></span> He defends Himself, now as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and now as man; as man, when He says, <q>If a man on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a> receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, that the law should not be broken;</q> (and He said not <q>that a man should be profited</q>); <q>are you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath day</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh007.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 7:23</font></u></a></span> As God again, when He says, <q>My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200140.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father works</font></u></a> hitherto, and I work.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:17</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>But when blamed for His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, He said, <q>Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungered, himself and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and did eat the show-bread?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:3-4</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>He brings forward the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> also.</p>
<p>And here again; <q>Is it lawful to do good on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a> days, or to do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>? Which of you shall have one sheep?</q> For He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, that they were all taken up with it, rather than with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. And indeed the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> says, that He also looked about upon them when asking these questions, that by His very eye He might win them over; but not even so did they become better.</p>
<p>And yet here He speaks only; whereas elsewhere in many cases He heals by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laying on of hands</font></u></a> also. But nevertheless none of these things made them meek; rather, while the man was healed, they by his health became worse.</p>
<p>For His desire indeed was to cure them before him, and He tried innumerable ways of healing, both by what He did in their presence, and by what He said: but since their malady after all was incurable, He proceeded to the work. <q>Then says He to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, like as the other.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:13</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>2. What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and take counsel together to slay Him. For <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>,</q> says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>, <q>went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.</q> They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So great an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. For not against strangers only, but even against our own, is it ever warring. And Mark says, they took this counsel with the Herodians. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 3:6</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>What then does the gentle and meek One? He withdrew, on being aware of it. <q>But when Jesus <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> their devices, He withdrew Himself,</q> it is said, <q>from them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:15</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Where now are they who say, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> ought to be done? Nay, by these things He signified, that the uncandid <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is not even thereby persuaded; and He made it plain that His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> too were blamed by them without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>. This however we should observe, that they grow fierce especially at the benefits done to their neighbors; and when they see any one delivered either from disease or from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, then is the time for them to find fault, and become wild beasts. Thus did they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumniate</font></u></a> Him, both when He was about to save the harlot, and when He was eating with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publicans</font></u></a>, and now again, when they saw the hand restored.</p>
<p>But do thou observe, I pray you, how He neither desists from His tender care over the infirm, and yet allays their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. <q>And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all; and He charged them that were healed, that they should make Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to no man.</q> Because, while the multitudes everywhere both admire and follow Him, they desist not from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Then, lest you should be confounded at what is going on, and at their strange frenzy, He introduces the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> also, foretelling all this. For so great was the accuracy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, that they omit not even these things, but foretell His very journeyings, and changes of place, and the intent with which He acted therein; that you might learn, how they spoke all by the Spirit. For if the secrets of men cannot by any art be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>, much more were it impossible to learn Christ's purpose, except the Spirit revealed it. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 2:11</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>What then says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>? Nay, it is subjoined: <q>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send forth judgment unto victory. And in His name shall the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> trust.</q> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable power, and opens to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> <q>a great door and effectual;</q> he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For <q>behold,</q> says He, <q>my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is well pleased.</q> Now if He chose Him, not as an adversary does Christ set aside the law, nor as being an enemy of the lawgiver, but as having the same mind with Him, and the same objects.</p>
<p>Then proclaiming His meekness, he says, <q>He shall not strive nor cry.</q> For His desire indeed was to heal in their presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this did He contend.</p>
<p>And intimating both His might, and their weakness, he says, <q>A bruised reed shall He not break.</q> For indeed it was easy to break them all to pieces like a reed, and not a reed merely, but one already bruised.</p>
<p><q>And smoking flax shall He not quench.</q> Here he sets forth both their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> that is kindled, and His might that is able to put down their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, and to quench it with all ease; whereby His great mildness is signified.</p>
<p>What then? Shall these things always be? And will He endure them perpetually, forming such frantic plots against Him? Far from it; but when He has performed His part, then shall He execute the other purposes also. For this He declared by saying <q>Till He send forth judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> trust.</q> As <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> likewise says, <q>Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> is fulfilled.</q> </p>
<p>But what is, <q>when He sends forth judgment unto victory?</q> When He has fulfilled all His own part, then, we are told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and that a perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gloriously</font></u></a> set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have prevailed, and He has left them no plea of contradiction, however shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness, <q>judgment.</q></p>
<p>But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to the punishment of unbelievers only, but He will also win to Himself the whole world. Wherefore He added, <q>And in His name shall the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> trust.</q></p>
<p>Then, to inform you that this too is according to the purpose of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, in the beginning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> had assured us of this likewise, together with what had gone before; saying, <q>My well-beloved, in whom my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is well pleased.</q> For of the well-beloved it is quite evident that He did these things also according to the mind of the beloved. </p>
<p>3. <q>Then they brought unto Him one possessed with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, blind and dumb, and He healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</q> </p>
<p>O <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spirit! He had barred up both entrances, whereby that person should have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, as well sight as hearing; nevertheless, both did Christ open.</p>
<p><q>And all the people were amazed, saying, Is not this the Son of David? But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a> said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a>, the prince of the devils.</q> </p>
<p>And yet what great thing had been said? Nevertheless, not even this did they endure: to such a degree, as I have already remarked, are they ever stung by the good works done to their neighbors, and nothing grieves them so much as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of men. And yet He had actually retired, and had given room for their passion to subside; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> was again rekindled, because a benefit was again conferred; and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spirit was not so indignant as they. For he indeed departed from the body, and gave place and fled away, uttering no sound; but these were endeavoring now to slay, now to defame Him. That is, their first aim not succeeding, they would fain hurt His good name.</p>
<p>Such a thing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, than which no worse <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> can exist. For the adulterer indeed enjoys some pleasure, such as it is, and in a short time accomplishes his proper <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> man punishes himself, and takes vengeance upon himself more than on the person whom he envies, and never ceases from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, but is continually engaged in the commission thereof. For as a sow in mire, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a> in our hurt, so also does he delight in his neighbor's ills; and if anything painful take place, then is he refreshed, and takes breath; accounting the calamities of others his own joys, and the blessings of others his own ills; and he considers not what pleasure may accrue to himself, but what pain to his neighbor. These men therefore were it not meet to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stone</font></u></a> and beat to death, like mad dogs, like destroying <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, like the very furies?</p>
<p>For as beetles feed on dung, so do these men on the calamities of others, being a sort of common foes and enemies of our nature. And whereas the rest of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> pity even a brute when it is killed, do you, on seeing a man receive benefits, become like a wild beast, tremble, and turn pale? Why, what can be worse than this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>? Therefore, you see, whoremongers and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publicans</font></u></a> were able to enter into the kingdom, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, being within it, went out: For <q>the children of the kingdom,</q> it is said, <q>shall be cast out.</q> And the former, once freed from their present <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, attained to things which they never looked for, while these latter lost even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things which they had; and very reasonably. For this turns a man into a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, this renders one a savage <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>. Thus did the first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> arise; thus was nature forgotten; thus the earth defiled; thus afterwards did it open its mouth, to receive yet living, and utterly destroy, Dathan, and Korah, and Abiram, and all that multitude. </p>
<p>4. But to declaim against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, one may say, is easy; but we ought to consider also how men are to be freed from the disease. How then are we to be rid of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>? If we bear in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, that as he who has committed fornication cannot lawfully enter the church, so neither he that envies; nay, and much less the latter than the former. For as things are, it is accounted even an indifferent thing; wherefore also it is little thought of; but if its real badness be made evident, we should easily refrain from it.</p>
<p>Weep then, and groan; lament, and entreat God. Learn to feel and to repent for it, as for a grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. And if you be of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, you will quickly be rid of the disease.</p>
<p>And who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not, one may say, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thing? No one indeed is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of it: yet they have not the same estimation of this passion as of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> and fornication. When, at least, did any one condemn himself bitterly for having envied? When did he entreat God concerning this pest, that He would be merciful to him? No man at any time: but if he shall fast and give a little money to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, though he be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> to the thousandth degree, he counts himself to have done nothing horrid, held as he is in subjection by the most accursed passion of all. Whence, for example, did Cain become such as he was? Whence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05527c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Esau</font></u></a>? Whence the children of Laban? Whence the sons of Jacob? Whence Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company? Whence Miriam? Whence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01003a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Aaron</font></u></a>? Whence the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> himself?</p>
<p>Herewith consider this also; that you injure not him whom you envy, but into yourself you are thrusting the sword. For wherein did Cain injure Abel? Did he not even against his own will send him the more quickly into the kingdom? But himself he pierced through with innumerable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. Wherein did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05527c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Esau</font></u></a> harm Jacob? Did not Jacob grow <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>, and enjoy unnumbered blessings; while he himself both became an outcast from his father's house, and wandered in a strange land, after that plot of his? And wherein did Jacob's sons again make Joseph the worse, and this, though they proceeded even unto blood? Had not they to endure famine, and encounter peril to the utmost, whereas he became king of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>? For the more you envy, the more do you become a procurer of greater blessing to the object of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. For there is a God who beholds these things; and when He sees him injured, that does no injury, him He exalts the more, and so makes him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, but you He punishes.</p>
<p>For if them that exult over their enemies, He suffer not to go unpunished (<q>For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> not,</q> it is said, <q>when your enemies fall, lest at any time the Lord see it, and it displease Him</q> ); much more such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> those who have done no wrong.</p>
<p>Let us then extirpate the many-headed wild beast. For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> many are the kinds of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. Thus, if he that loves one that is a friend to him has no more than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>, where shall he stand who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> him that does him no wrong? And how shall he escape <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, becoming worse than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathens</font></u></a>? Wherefore also I do exceedingly grieve, that we who are commanded to copy the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, or rather the Lord of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, emulate the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. For indeed there is much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, even in the church; and more among us, than among those under authority. Wherefore we must even discourse unto ourselves.</p>
<p>5. Tell me then, why do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> your neighbor? Because you see him reaping <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and words of good report? Then do you not bear in mind how much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> bring on the unguarded? Lifting them up to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, to vainglory, to arrogance, to contemptuousness; making them more careless? And besides these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, they wither also lightly away. For the most grievous thing is this, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> arising therefrom abide <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>, but the pleasure at the moment of its appearing, is flown away. For these things then do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>? Tell me.</p>
<p><q>But he has great influence with the Ruler, and leads and drives all things which way he will, and inflicts pain on them that offend him, and benefits his flatterers, and has much power.</q> These are the sayings of secular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, and of men that are riveted to the earth. For the spiritual man nothing shall be able to hurt.</p>
<p>For what serious harm shall he do to him? Vote him out of his office? And what of that? For if it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> done, he is even profited; for nothing so provokes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as for one to hold the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest's</font></u></a> office unworthily. But if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjustly</font></u></a>, the blame again falls on the other, not on him; for he who has suffered anything <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjustly</font></u></a>, and borne it nobly, obtains in this way the greater confidence towards God.</p>
<p>Let us not then aim at this, how we may be in places of power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and authority, but that we may live in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> and self denial. For indeed places of authority persuade men to do many things which are not approved of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and great vigor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is needed, in order to use authority aright. For as he that is deprived thereof, practises self restraint, whether with or against his will, so he that enjoys it is in some such condition, as if any one living with a graceful and beautiful damsel were to receive rules never to look upon her unchastely. For authority is that kind of thing. Wherefore many, even against their will, has it induced to show insolence; it awakens <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, and removes the bridle from the tongue, and tears off the door of the lips; fanning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as with a wind, and sinking the bark in the lowest depth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. Him then who is in so great danger do you admire, and do you say he is to be envied? Nay, how great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> is here! Consider, at any rate (besides what we have mentioned), how many enemies and accusers, and how many flatterers this person has besieging him. Are these then, I pray you, reasons for calling a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>? Nay, who can say so?</p>
<p><q>But the people,</q> you say, <q>hold high account of him.</q> And what is this? For the people surely is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, to whom he is to render account: so that in naming the people, you are speaking of nothing else than of other breakers, and rocks, and shoals, and sunken ridges. For to be in favor with the people, the more it makes a man illustrious, the greater the dangers, the cares, the despondencies it brings with it. For such an one has no power at all to take breath or stand still, having so severe a master. And why say I, <q>stand still and take breath</q>? Though such an one have never so many good works, hardly does he enter into the kingdom. For nothing is so wont to overthrow men, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> which comes of the multitude, making them cowardly, ignoble, flatterers, hypocrites.</p>
<p>Why, for instance, did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a> say that Christ was possessed? Was it not because they were greedy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of the multitude?</p>
<p>And whence did the multitude pass the right judgment on Him? Was it not because this disease had no hold on them? For nothing, nothing so much tends to make men lawless and foolish, as gaping after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of the multitude. Nothing makes them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> and immoveable, like despising the same.</p>
<p>Wherefore also great vigor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is needed for him who is to hold out against such an impulse, and so violent a blast. For as when things are prosperous, he prefers himself to all, so when he undergoes the contrary, he would fain bury himself alive: and this is to him both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and the kingdom, when he has come to be overwhelmed by this passion.</p>
<p>Is all this then, I pray you, matter of envyings, and not rather of lamentations and tears? Every one surely can see. But you do the same, in envying one in that kind of credit, as if a person, seeing another bound and scourged and torn by innumerable wild beasts, were to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> him his wounds and stripes. For in fact, as many men as the multitude comprises, so many bonds also, so many tyrants has he: and, what is yet more grievous, each of these has a different mind: and they all judge whatever comes into their heads concerning him that is a slave to them, without examining into anything; but whatever is the decision of this or that person, this they also confirm.</p>
<p>What manner of waves then, what tempest so grievous as this? Yea, such a one is both puffed up in a moment by the pleasure, and is under water again easily, being ever in fluctuation, in tranquillity never. Thus, before the time of the assembly, and of the contests in speaking, he is possessed with anxiety and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; but after the assembly he is either dead with despondency, or rejoices on the contrary without measure; a worse thing than sorrow. For that pleasure is not a less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> than sorrow is plain from the effect it has on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; how light it makes it, and unsteady, and fluttering.</p>
<p>And this one may see even from those of former times. When, for instance, was David to be admired; when he rejoiced, or when he was in anguish? When, the people of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? Groaning and calling upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, or exulting in the wilderness, and worshipping the calf? Wherefore Solomon too, who best of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> what pleasure is, says, <q>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of laughter.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/ecc007.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ecclesiastes 7:2</font></u></a></span> Wherefore Christ also blesses the one, saying, <q>Blessed are they that mourn,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:4</font></u></a></span> but the other sort He bewails, saying, <q>Woe unto you that laugh, for you shall weep.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk006.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 6:25</font></u></a></span> And very fitly. For in delight the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is more relaxed and effeminate, but in mourning it is braced up, and grows sober, and is delivered from the whole swarm of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and becomes higher and stronger.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> then all these things, let us shun the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that comes from the multitude, and the pleasure that springs therefrom, that we may win the real and everlasting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might, forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p>Even before now they had accused Him of this, that <q>by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a> He casts out the devils.</q> But whereas then He did not rebuke them, allowing them both to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His power by His more numerous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, and by His teaching to learn His majesty: now, since they continued saying the same, He proceeds also to rebuke them, showing His Godhead by this first, that He made their secrets public; and secondly, by the very act of casting out the devils with ease.</p>
<p>And indeed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200141.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accusation</font></u></a> too was very shameless. Because, as I have said, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> seeks not what to say, but only that it may say somewhat. Yet for all that, not even so did Christ despise them, but defends Himself with the forbearance proper to Him, teaching us to be meek to our enemies; and though they say such things, as we are neither conscious of, nor have they any the least probability, not to be disturbed, nor troubled, but with all long suffering to render them an account. This then He did most especially on that very occasion, affording the strongest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>, that the things were false that were said by them. For neither was it a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniac's</font></u></a> part to exhibit so much meekness; it was not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniac's</font></u></a> part to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> men's secrets.</p>
<p>For, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, both because of the exceeding impudence of such a suspicion, and because of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the multitude, they dared not publicly make these charges, but were turning them in their mind. But He, to show them that He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> all that likewise, does not set down the accusation, nor does He expose their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>; but the refutation He adds, leaving it to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> of them that had said it to convict them. For on one thing only was He bent, to do good to them that were sinning, not to expose them.</p>
<p>Yet surely, if He had been minded to extend his speech in length, and to make them ridiculous, and withal to have exacted of them also the most extreme penalty, there was nothing to hinder Him. Nevertheless He put aside all these things, and looked to one object only, not to render them more contentious, but more candid, and so to dispose them better toward amendment.</p>
<p>How then does He plead with them? Not by allegation out of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> (for they would not so much as attend, but were sure rather to distort their meaning), but by the events of ordinary life. For <q>every kingdom,</q> says He, <q>divided against itself shall not stand; and a city and a house, if it be divided, is soon dissolved.</q> </p>
<p>For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> from without are not so ruinous as the civil ones. Yea, and this is the case in bodies too; it is the case even in all things; but for this time He takes His illustration from those that are more publicly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And yet, what is there more powerful on earth than a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200141.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom</font></u></a>? Nothing, but nevertheless it perishes if in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200141.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">dissension</font></u></a>. And if in that case one throw the blame on the great burden of the affairs thereof, as breaking down by its own weight; what would you say of a city? And what of a house? Thus, whether it be a small thing, or a great, if at dissension with itself, it perishes. If then I, having a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, do by him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200141.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cast</font></u></a> out the devils, there is dissension and fighting among devils, and they take their stand one against another. But if they stand one against another, their strength is wasted and destroyed. <q>For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> cast out <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a></q> (and He said not <q>the devils,</q> implying their great unanimity one with another), <q>he is then divided against himself;</q> so He speaks. But if he be divided, he has become weaker, and is ruined; and if he be ruined, how can he cast out another?</p>
<p>Do you see how great the absurdity of the accusation, how great the folly, the inconsistency? Since it is not for the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to say first, that He stands, and casts out devils, and then to say, that He stands by that, which it was likely would be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of His undoing.</p>
<p>2. This then being the first refutation, the next after it is that which relates to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. For not always in one way only, but also in a second and third, He solves their objections, being minded most abundantly to silence their shamelessness. Which sort of thing He did also with respect to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, bringing forward David, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, the testimony that says, <q>I will have mercy, and not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>,</q> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>, for which it was ordained; <q>for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sabbath</font></u></a>,</q> says He, was for man. This then He does in the present case also: where after the first He proceeds to a second refutation, plainer than the former. </p>
<p><q>For if I,</q> says He, <q>by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a> cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:27</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>See here too His gentleness. For He said not, <q>my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>,</q> nor, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>,</q> but <q>your sons;</q> to the end that if indeed they were minded to return to the same nobleness with them, they might derive hence a powerful spring that way; but if they were uncandid, and continued in the same course, they might not thenceforth be able to allege any plea, though ever so shameless. </p>
<p>But what He says is like this, <q>By whom do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> cast them out?</q> For in fact they were doing so already, because they had received authority from Him, and these men brought no charge against them; their quarrel not being with the acts, but with the person only. As then it was His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> to show that their sayings arose only from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> against Him, He brings forward the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>; thus: If I so cast them out, much more those, who have received their authority from me. Nevertheless, no such thing have ye said to them. How then bring ye these charges against me, the author of their doings, while acquitting them of the accusations? This, however, will not free you from your punishment, rather it will condemn you the more. Therefore also He added, <q>They shall be your judges.</q> For when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> from among you, and having been practised in these things, both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> me and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>, it is most clear that they will also condemn those who are against me both in deed and word.</p>
<p><q>But if I cast out devils by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a>, then the Kingdom of God has come unto you.</q> </p>
<p>What means <q>the Kingdom</q>? <q>My coming.</q> See how again He conciliates and soothes them, and draws them to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of Himself, and signifies that they are warring with their own good, and contentious against their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. <q>For whereas ye ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>and leap for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, that One has come bestowing those great and unutterable blessings, hymned of old by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and that the time of your prosperity is at hand; ye do the contrary; so far from receiving the blessings, you do even speak ill of them, and frame accusations that have no real being.</q></p>
<p>Now Matthew indeed says, <q>If I by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a> cast out</q>; but Luke, <q>If I by the finger of God cast out the devils:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk011.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 11:20</font></u></a></span> implying that to cast out devils is a work of the greatest power, and not of any ordinary <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. And He means indeed that from these things they should infer and say, If this be so, then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> has come. This, however, He says not, but in a reserved way, and so as not to be galling to them, He darkly intimates it by saying, <q>Then the kingdom of God has come unto you.</q> </p>
<p>Do you see exceeding wisdom? By the very things which they were blaming, He showed His presence shining forth.</p>
<p>Then, to conciliate them, He said not simply, <q>The Kingdom has come,</q> but, <q>unto you,</q> as though He had said, To you the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things have come; wherefore then feel displeased at your proper blessings? Why <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? This is that time, which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> long ago foretold: this, the sign of that advent which was celebrated by them, even these things being wrought by divine power. For the fact indeed, that they are wrought, yourselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>; but that they are wrought by divine power, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> themselves cry out. Yea, and it is impossible that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> should be stronger now; rather he must of absolute necessity be weak. But it cannot be, that he who is weak should, as though he were strong, cast out the strong <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. </p>
<p>Now thus speaking He signified the power of charity, and the weakness of separation and contentiousness. Wherefore He was Himself also continually charging His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, on every occasion, concerning charity, and teaching them that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, to subvert it, leaves nothing undone.</p>
<p>3. Having then uttered His second refutation, He adds also a third, thus saying:</p>
<p><q>How can one enter into the strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoil his goods?</q> </p>
<p>For that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> cannot possibly cast out <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> is evident from what has been said; but that neither in any other way is it possible to cast him out, except one first get the better of him, this too is acknowledged by all.</p>
<p>What then is established hereby? The former statement, with more abundant evidence. <q>Why, I am so far,</q> says He, <q>from using the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> as an ally, that I make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> upon him, and bind him; and an infallible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> thereof is the plundering of his goods.</q> See how the contrary is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>, of what they were attempting to establish. For whereas they wished to show, that not by His own power does He cast out devils, He shows that not only the devils, but even their very chief leader is held by Him bound with all authority; and that over him, before them, did He prevail by His own power. And this is evident from the things that are done. For if he be the prince, and they subjects, how, except he were worsted, and made to bow down, could they have been spoiled?</p>
<p>And here His saying seems to me to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> likewise. For not only, I suppose, are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a> the goods of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, but also the men that are doing his works. Therefore to declare that He does not only cast out devils, but also will drive away all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> from the world, and will put down his sorceries, and make all his arts useless, He said these things.</p>
<p>And He said not, He will take away, but <q>He will spoil,</q> to express what is done with authority. But He calls him <q>strong,</q> not because he is so by nature, God forbid, but declaring his former tyranny, which arose from our remissness.</p>
<p>4. <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:30</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Behold also a fourth refutation. For what is my desire? Says He. To bring men to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, to teach <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, to proclaim the kingdom. What, that of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a>? The contrary to these. How then should he that gathers not with me, nor is at all with me, be likely to co-operate with me? And why do I say co-operate? Nay, on the contrary, his desire is rather to scatter abroad my goods. He then who is so far from cooperating that he even scatters abroad, how should he have exhibited such unanimity with me, as with me to cast out the devils?</p>
<p>Now it is a natural surmise that He said this not of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> only, but Himself also of Himself, as being for His part against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and scattering abroad his goods. And how, one may say, is he that is not with me against me? By this very fact, of his not gathering. But if this be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, much more he that is against him. For if he that does not co-operate is an enemy, much more he that wages <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But all these things He says, to indicate His enmity against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, how great and unspeakable it is. For tell me, if you must go to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with any one, he that is not willing to fight on your side, by this very fact is he not against you? And if elsewhere He says, <q>He that is not against you is for you,</q> it is not contrary to this. For here He signified one actually against them, but there He points to one who in part is on their side: <q>For they cast out devils,</q> it is said <q>in Your name.</q> </p>
<p>But to me He seems here to be hinting also at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, setting them on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil's</font></u></a> side. For they too were against Him, and were scattering what He gathered. As to the fact that He was hinting at them also, He declared it by speaking thus,</p>
<p><q>Therefore I say unto you, that all manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> shall be forgiven unto men.</q> </p>
<p>5. Thus having defended Himself, and refuted their objection, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> the vanity of their shameless dealings, He proceeds to alarm them. For this too is no small part of advice and correction, not only to plead and persuade, but to threaten also; which He does in many passages, when making <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> and giving counsel.</p>
<p>And though the saying seem to have much obscurity, yet if we attend, its solution will prove easy.</p>
<p>First then it were well to listen to the very words: <q>All manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> shall be forgiven unto men; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> shall not be forgiven unto them. And whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaks against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> </p>
<p>What now is it that He affirms? Many things have ye spoken against me; that I am a deceiver, an adversary of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. These things I forgive you on your repentance, and exact no penalty of you; but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> against the Spirit shall not be forgiven, no, not to those who repent. And how can this be right? For even this was forgiven upon repentance. Many at least of those who said these words <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> afterward, and all was forgiven them. What is it then that He says? That this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is above all things unpardonable. Why so? Because Himself indeed they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not, who He might be, but of the Spirit they received ample experience. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> also by the Spirit said whatever they said; and indeed all in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a> had a very high notion of Him.</p>
<p>What He says, then, is this: Be it so: you are offended at me, because of the flesh with which I am encompassed: can you say of the Spirit also, We <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it not? And therefore is your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a> unpardonable, and both here and hereafter shall you suffer punishment. For many indeed have been punished here only (as he who had committed fornication, as they who partook unworthily of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, among the Corinthians); but you, both here and hereafter. </p>
<p>Now as to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemies</font></u></a> against me, before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, I forgive them: and the daring crime too of the cross itself; neither shall you be condemned for your unbelief alone. (For neither had they, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, perfect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. And on many occasions He even charges them to make Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to no man before the Passion; and on the cross He said that this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> was forgiven them.) But as to your words touching the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, they will have no excuse. For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that He is speaking of what was said of Him before the crucifixion, He added, <q>Whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>,</q> there is no more forgiveness. Wherefore? Because this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to you; and the truths are notorious which you harden yourselves against. For though ye say that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not me; yet of this surely you are not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, that to cast out devils, and to do cures, is a work of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>. It is not then I only whom you are insulting, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> also. Wherefore your punishment can be averted by no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, neither here nor there.</p>
<p>For so of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, some are punished both here, and there, some here only, some there only, others neither here nor there. Here and there, as these very men (for both here did they pay a penalty, when they suffered those incurable ills at the taking of their city, and there shall they undergo a very grievous one), as the inhabitants of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>; as many others. There only, as the rich man who endured the flames, and had not at his command so much as a drop of water. Here, as he that had committed fornication among the Corinthians. Neither here nor there, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, as the blessed Job; for their sufferings were not surely in the way of punishment, but as contests and wrestlings.</p>
<p>Let us labor, therefore, to be of the same part with these: or if not with these, at least with them that wash away their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> here. For fearful indeed is that other judgment, and inexorable the vengeance, and incurable the punishment.</p>
<p>6. But if you desire not to be punished even here, pass judgment on yourself, exact your own penalty. Listen to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, when he says, <q>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</q> If you do this, proceeding in order you shall even arrive at a crown.</p>
<p>But how are we to exact our own penalty? One may ask. Lament, groan bitterly, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>, afflict yourself, call to remembrance your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> in their particulars. This thing is no small torture to a man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. If any man has been in a state of contrition, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is punished by this more than anything. If any has been living in remembrance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> the anguish thence arising. Therefore does God appoint righteousness as a reward for such repentance, saying, <q>Be first to tell your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, that you may be justified.</q> For it is not, it is not indeed, a small step towards amendment, to lay together all our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and to be continually revolving and reckoning them up with their particulars. For he that is doing this will be so heart-broken, as not to think himself worthy so much as to live; and he that thinks thus, will be tenderer than any wax. For tell me not of acts of fornication only, nor of adulteries, nor of these things that are manifest, and acknowledged among all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>: but lay together also your secret crafts, and your false accusations, and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> speakings, and your vain gloryings, and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, and all such things. For neither will these bring a trifling punishment. For the reviler too shall fall into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>; and the drunkard has no part in the kingdom; and he that lovest not his neighbor so offends <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as to find no help even in his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrdom</font></u></a>; and he that neglects his own has denied the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and he who overlooks the poor is sent into the fire.</p>
<p>Account not then these things to be little, but put all together, and write them as in a book. For if you write them down, God blots them out; even as on the other hand, if you omit writing them, God both inscribes them, and exacts their penalty. It were then far better for them to be written by us, and blotted out above, than on the contrary, when we have forgotten them, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> to bring them before our eyes in that day.</p>
<p>Therefore that this may not be so, let us reckon up all with strictness, and we shall find ourselves answerable for much. For who is clear from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>? Nay, tell me not of the quantity, but since even in a small amount we shall pay the same penalty, consider this and repent. Who is rid of all insolence? Yet this casts into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. Who has not secretly spoken <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of his neighbor? Yet this deprives one of the Kingdom. Who has not been self-willed? Yet this man is more unclean than all. Who has not looked with unchaste eyes? Yet this is a complete adulterer. Who has not been <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> with his brother without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a></q>? Yet such an one is <q>in danger of the council.</q> Who has not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a>? Yet this thing is of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one. Who has not forsworn himself? But this man is something more than of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one. Who has not served <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mammon</font></u></a>? But this man is fallen away from the genuine service of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>I have also other things greater than these to mention: but even these are enough, and able, if a man be not made of stone, nor utterly past feeling, to bring him to compunction. For if each one of them casts into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, what will they not bring to pass when all are met together?</p>
<p>How then can one be saved? It may be asked. By application of the countervailing remedies: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, compunction, repentance, humility, a contrite heart, contempt of possessions. For God has marked out for us innumerable ways of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, if we be willing to attend. Let us then attend, and let us every way cleanse out our wounds, showing mercy, remitting our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> against them that have displeased us, giving thanks for all things to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a> according to our power, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a> sincerely, <q>making unto ourselves friends of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mammon</font></u></a> of unrighteousness.</q> For so shall we be able to obtain pardon for our offenses, and to win the promised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things; whereof may we all be counted worthy, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matt. XII. 33</font></u></a>.</strong></p>
<p><q>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt; for the tree is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> by his fruit.</q></p>
<p>Again in another way He shames them, and is not content with His former refutations. But this He does, not freeing Himself from accusations, (for what went before was quite enough), but as wishing to amend them.</p>
<p>Now His meaning is like this: none of you has either found fault about the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> healed, as not being healed; nor has said, that it is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thing to deliver one from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. For though they had been ever so shameless, they could not have said this.</p>
<p>Since therefore they brought no charge against the works, but were defaming the Doer of them, He signifies that this accusation is against both the common modes of reasoning, and the congruity of the circumstances. A thing of aggravated shamelessness, not only to interpret maliciously, but also to make up such charges as are contrary to men's common notions.</p>
<p>And see how free He is from contentiousness. For He said not, <q>Make the tree good, forasmuch as the fruit also is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>;</q> but, most entirely stopping their mouths, and exhibiting His own considerateness, and their insolence, He says, Even if you are minded to find fault with my works, I forbid it not at all, only bring not inconsistent and contradictory charges. For thus were they sure to be most clearly detected, persisting against what was too palpable. Wherefore to no purpose is your maliciousness, says He, and your self-contradictory statements. Because in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> the distinction of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200142.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tree</font></u></a> is shown by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200142.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fruit</font></u></a>, not the fruit by the tree; but you do the contrary. For what if the tree be the origin of the fruit; yet it is the fruit that makes the tree to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>. And it were consistent, either in blaming us to find fault with our works too, or praising these, to set us who do them free from these charges. But now ye do the contrary; for having no fault to find with the works, which is the fruit, you pass the opposite judgment upon the tree, calling me a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniac</font></u></a>; which is utter insanity.</p>
<p>Yea, and what He had said before, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:16-18</font></u></a></span> this He establishes now also; that a good tree cannot bring forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit, nor again can the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200142.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">converse</font></u></a> be. So that their charges were against all consistency and nature.</p>
<p>Then since He is arguing not for Himself, but for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, He has dealt out His reproof even as a torrent, saying, <q>O generation of vipers, how can you, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:34</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Now this is at once to accuse, and to give demonstration of His own sayings from their case. For behold, says He, you being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> trees, cannot bring forth good fruit. I do not then marvel at your talking thus: for you were both ill nurtured, being of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> ancestors, and you have acquired a bad mind.</p>
<p>And see how carefully, and without any hold for exception, He has expressed His accusations: in that He said not, How can you speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, being a generation of vipers? (for this latter is nothing to the former): but, <q>How can you, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things?</q></p>
<p>But He called them <q>broods of vipers,</q> because they prided themselves on their forefathers. To signify therefore that they had no advantage thereby, He both casts them out from their relationship to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and assigns them forefathers of kindred disposition, having stripped them of that ground of illustriousness.</p>
<p><q>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</q> Here again He indicates His Godhead, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> their secrets: and that not for words only, but also for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> thoughts, they shall suffer punishment; and that He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> it all, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And He says, that it is possible even for men to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> these things; for this is a natural consequence, that when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> is overflowing within, its words should be poured forth through the lips. So that when you hear a man speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> words, do not suppose only so much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> to be in him as the words display, but conjecture the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200142.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fountain</font></u></a> to be much more abundant; for that which is spoken outwardly, is the superabundance of that which is within.</p>
<p>See how vehemently He reprehends them. For if what they had said is so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and is of the very mind of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, consider the root and well-spring of their words, how far that must reach. And this is naturally the case; for while the tongue through shame often pours not forth all its <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> at once, the heart having no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, fearlessly gives birth to whatever <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> it will; for of God it has not much regard. Since then men's sayings come to examination and are set before all, but the heart is concealed; therefore the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> of the former grow less, while those of the latter increase. But when that within is multiplied, all that has been awhile hidden comes forth with a violent gushing. And as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> vomiting strive at first to keep down the humors that force their way out, but, when they are overcome, cast forth much abomination; so do they that devise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> things, and speak ill of their neighbors.</p>
<p><q>A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man out of his good treasure,</q> says He, <q>brings forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, and an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> man out of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> treasure brings forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> things.</q> </p>
<p>For think not by any means, says He, that it is so in respect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> only, for in goodness also the same occurs: for there too the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> within is more than the words without. By which He signified, that both they were to be accounted more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> than their words indicated, and Himself more perfectly good than His sayings declared. And He calls it <q>a treasure,</q> indicating its abundance.</p>
<p>Then again He fences them in with great terror. For think not at all, says He, that the thing stops at this, that is, at the condemnation of the multitude; nay, for all that do wickedly in such things shall suffer the utmost punishment. And He said not, <q>ye,</q> partly in order to instruct our whole race, partly to make His saying the less burdensome.</p>
<p><q>But I say unto you,</q> this is His word, <q>that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:36</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And that is idle, which is not according to the fact, which is false, which has in it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a> accusation; and some say, that which is vain also, for instance, provoking inordinate laughter, or what is filthy, and immodest, and coarse.</p>
<p><q>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:37</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see how far the tribunal is from invidiousness? How favorable the account required? For not upon what another has said of you, but from what you have yourself spoken, will the Judge give His sentence; which is of all things the very fairest: since surely with you it rests, either to speak, or not to speak.</p>
<p>2. Wherefore not those that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14035b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slandered</font></u></a>, but the slanderers, have need to be anxious and to tremble. For the former are not constrained to answer for themselves touching the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> things which are said of them, but the latter will, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> they have spoken; and over these impends the whole danger. So that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> censured should be without anxiety, not being to give account of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> that others have said; but the censurers have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to be in anxiety, and to tremble, as being themselves to be dragged before the judgment-seat in that behalf. For this is indeed a diabolical snare, and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> having in it no pleasure, but harm only. Yea, and such an one is laying up an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> treasure in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. And if he that has an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> humor in him does himself first reap the fruits of the malady, much more he that is treasuring up in himself what is more bitter than any bile, I mean, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, will suffer the utmost <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, gathering unto himself a grievous disease. And it is evident from the things that He vomits out. For if they pain others so much, far more the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that gives them birth.</p>
<p>Thus the plotter destroys himself first; just as he that treads on fire burns up himself, and he that smites adamant spites himself, and he that kicks against the pricks draws blood from himself. For somewhat of this kind is he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to suffer wrong, and to bear it manfully; he is adamant, and the pricks, and fire; but he that has used himself to do wrong is feebler than any clay.</p>
<p>Not therefore to suffer wrong is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, but to do it, and not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to bear being wronged. For instance, how great wrongs did David endure! How great wrongs did Saul commit! Which then was the stronger and happier? Which the more wretched and miserable? Was it not he that did wrong? And mark it. Saul had promised, if David should slay the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12021c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philistine</font></u></a>, to take him for his son-in law, and to give him his daughter with great favor. He slew the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12021c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philistine</font></u></a>; the other broke his engagements, and so far from bestowing her, did even go about to slay him. Which then became the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>? Was not the one choking with despair and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>, while the other shone brighter than the sun with his trophies, and his loyalty to God? Again, before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, was not the one suffocated with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, while the other enduring all in silence, won all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and bound them unto himself? And when he had even gotten him into his hands, and spared him, which again was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>? And which wretched? Which was the weaker? Which the more powerful? Was it not this man, who did not avenge himself even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>? And very naturally. For the one had armed soldiers, but the other, righteousness, that is more mighty than ten thousand armies, for his ally and helper. And for this reason, though <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjustly</font></u></a> conspired against, he endured not to slay him even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>. For he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> by what had taken place before, that not to do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, but to suffer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, this is what makes men more powerful. So it is with bodies also, so also with trees.</p>
<p>And what did Jacob? Was he not injured by Laban, and suffered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>? Which then was the stronger? He that had gotten the other into his hands, and dared not touch him, but was afraid and trembling; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen031.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 31:29</font></u></a></span> or he whom we see without arms and soldiers proving more terrible to him than innumerable kings?</p>
<p>But that I may give you another demonstration of what I have said, greater than this, let us again in the instance of David himself try the reasoning on the opposite side. For this man who being injured was so strong, afterwards upon committing an injury became on the contrary the weaker party. At least, when he had wronged Uriah, his position was changed again, and the weakness passed to the wrong doer, and the might to the injured; for he being dead laid waste the other's house. And the one being a king, and alive, could do nothing, but the other, being but a soldier, and slain, turned upside down all that pertained to his adversary.</p>
<p>Would ye that in another way also I should make what I say plainer? Let us look into their case, who avenge themselves even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>. For as to the wrong doers, that they are the most worthless of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, warring against their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; this is surely plain to every one.</p>
<p>But who avenged himself <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>, yet kindled innumerable ills, and pierced himself through with many calamities and sorrows? The captain of David's host. For he both stirred up a grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and suffered unnumbered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>; not one whereof would have happened, had he but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> how to command himself. </p>
<p>Let us flee therefore from this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and neither in words nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> do our neighbors wrong. For He said not, If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14035b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slander</font></u></a>, and summon a court of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>, but simply, If you speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, though within yourself, even so shall you suffer the utmost punishment. Though it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> which you have said, though thou have spoken upon conviction, even so shall vengeance come upon you. For not according to what the other has done, but according to what you have spoken, will God pass sentence; <q>for by your words you shall be condemned,</q> says He. Are you not told that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisee</font></u></a> also spoke the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, and affirmed what was manifest to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, without discovering what was hidden? Nevertheless, he paid the utmost penalty.</p>
<p>But if we ought not to accuse men of things which are acknowledged, much less of those which are disputed; nay, for the offender has a judge. Do not now, I warn you, seize upon the privilege of the Only Begotten. For Him is the throne of judgment reserved.</p>
<p>3. Would you however be a judge? You have a court of judgment which has great profit, and bears no blame. Make consideration, as judge, to sit down upon your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, and bring before it all your transgressions, search out the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and exact with strictness the account thereof, and say, <q>wherefore did you dare to do this and that?</q> And if she shun these, and be searching into other men's matters, say to her, <q>Not about these am I judging you, not for these are you come here to plead. For what, if such a one be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> man? Thou, why did you commit this and that offense? Answer for yourself, not to accuse; look to your own matters, do not those of others.</q> And be thou continually urging her to this anxious trial. Then, if she have nothing to say, but shrink back, wear her out with the scourge, like some restless and unchaste handmaid. And this tribunal do thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to sit every day, and picture the river of fire, the venomous worm, the rest of the torments.</p>
<p>And permit her not to be with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> any more, nor bear with her shameless sayings, <q>he comes to me, he plots against me, he tempts me;</q> but tell her, <q>If you were not willing, all that would be to no purpose.</q> And if she say again, <q>I am entangled with a body, I am clothed with flesh, I dwell in the world, I abide on earth;</q> tell her, <q>All these are excuses and pretexts. For such an one too was encompassed with flesh, and such another dwelling in the world, and abiding on earth, is approved; and you yourself too, when you do well, doest it encompassed with flesh.</q> And if she be pained at hearing this, take not off your hand; for she will not die, if you smite her, but you will save her from death. And if she say again, <q>Such an one provoked me,</q> tell her, <q>But it is in your power not to be provoked; often at least you have restrained your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>.</q> And if she say, <q>The beauty of such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> moved me;</q> tell her, <q>Yet were you able to have mastered yourself.</q> Bring forward those that have got the better, bring forward the first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, who said, <q>The serpent beguiled me,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen003.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 3:13</font></u></a></span> and yet was not acquitted of the blame.</p>
<p>And when you are searching out these things, let no man be present, let no man disturb you; but as the judges sit under curtains to judge, so do thou too, instead of curtains, seek a time and place of quiet. And when after your supper you are risen up, and art about to lie down, then hold this your judgment; this is the time convenient for you, and the place, your bed, and your chamber. This the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> likewise commanded, saying, <q>For the things which you say in your hearts, be ye moved to compunction upon your beds.</q> And for small offenses require great satisfaction, that unto the great you may never even approach. If you do this every day, you will with confidence stand at that fearful judgment-seat.</p>
<p>In this way <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> became clean; therefore also he said, <q>For if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:31</font></u></a></span> Thus did Job cleanse his sons. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job001.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 1:5</font></u></a></span> For he that offered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> for secret <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, much more did he require an account of such as were manifest.</p>
<p>4. But we do not so, but altogether the contrary. For as soon as we are laid down to rest, we rather think over all our worldly matters; and some introduce unclean thoughts, some usuries, and contracts, and temporal cares.</p>
<p>And if we have a daughter, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgin</font></u></a>, we watch her strictly; but that which is more precious to us than a daughter, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, her we suffer to play the harlot and defile herself, introducing to her innumerable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> thoughts. And whether it be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, or that of luxury, or that of fair <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, or that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, or be it what you will else that is minded to come in, we throw open the doors, and attract and invite it, and help it to defile our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> at its leisure. And what can be more barbarous than this, to overlook our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that is more precious than all, abused by so many adulterers, and so long companying with them, even until they are sated? Which will never be. So it is, therefore, that when sleep overtakes us, then only do they depart from her; or rather not even then, for our dreams and imaginations furnish her with the same images. Whence also, when day has come, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> stored with such images often falls away to the actual performance of those fancies.</p>
<p>And thou, while into the apple of your eye you suffer not so much as a grain of dust to enter, do you pass unnoticed your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, gathering to itself a heap of so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>? When shall we then be able to clear out this filth, which we are daily laying up within us? When to cut up the thorns? When to sow the seed? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that henceforth the time of harvest is at hand? But we have not yet so much as ploughed our fields. If then the husbandman should come and find fault, what shall we say? And what answer shall we make? That no man gave us the seed? Nay, this is sown daily. That no man, then, has cut up the thorns? Nay, every day we are sharpening the sickle. But do the necessary engagements of life distract you? And why have you not crucified yourself to the world? For if he that repays that only, which is given him, is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, because he did not double it; he that has wasted even this, what will be said to him? If that person was bound, and cast out where is gnashing of teeth, what shall we have to suffer, who, when numberless motives are drawing us toward <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, shrink back and are unwilling?</p>
<p>For what is there, that has not enough in it to persuade you? Do you see not the vileness of the world, the uncertainty of life, the toil, the sweat, for things present? What? Is it the case that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> must be toiled for, but may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> be had without toil? If then both in the one and in the other there is toil, why did you not choose this, which has so great profit?</p>
<p>Or rather, there are some parts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, which are free even from toil. For what kind of toil is it, not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumniate</font></u></a>, not to lie, not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, to lay aside our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> against our neighbor? Nay, on the contrary, to do these things is toilsome, and brings much anxiety.</p>
<p>What plea then shall we have, what excuse, not doing right even in these matters? For hereby it is plain, that out of remissness and sloth the more toilsome duties also altogether escape us.</p>
<p>All these things let us consider; let us flee <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>, let us choose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that we may attain both unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things that are present, and unto those that are to come, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><strong>Matthew 12:38-39.</strong></p>
<p><q><em>Then certain of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scribes</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a> answered Him, saying, Master, we would see a sign from You. But He answered and said</em>, <em>An <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonas.</em></q></p>
<p>Could then anything be more foolish than these men (not more impious only), who after so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, as though none had been wrought, say, <q>We would see a sign from You?</q> With what intent then did they so speak? That they might lay hold of Him again. For since by His words He had stopped their mouths, once and twice and often, and had checked their shameless tongue, they come to His works again. At which also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> marvelling again, said,</p>
<p><q>Then certain of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a> answered Him, asking a sign.</q></p>
<p><q>Then,</q> when? When they ought to be stooping before Him, to admire, to be amazed and give way, <q>then</q> they desist not from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And see their words too, teeming with flattery and dissimulation. For they thought to draw Him towards them in that way. And now they insult, now they flatter Him; now calling Him a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniac</font></u></a>, now again <q>Master,</q> both out of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, how contrary soever the words they speak.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He rebukes them severely. And when they were questioning Him roughly and insulting Him, He reasoned with them gently; when they were flattering; reproachfully, and with great severity; implying that He is superior to either passion, and is neither at the one time moved to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, nor at the other softened by flattery. And see His reproach, that it is not merely hard words, but contains a demonstration of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. For what says He?</p>
<p><q>An <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and adulterous generation seeks after a sign.</q> Now what He says is to this effect: What marvel if you behave so to me who have been hitherto unknown to you when even to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, of whom you have had so much experience, you have done the very same? Forsaking Him, you have run unto the devils, drawing to yourselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> lovers. With this Ezekiel too was continually upbraiding them. </p>
<p>Now by these sayings He signified Himself to be of one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200143.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accord</font></u></a> with His Father, and them to be doing nothing new; He was also unfolding their secrets, how with hypocrisy and as enemies they were making their demand. Therefore He called them <q>an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> generation,</q> because they have been always ungrateful towards their benefactors; because upon favors they become worse, which belongs to extreme <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And He called it <q>adulterous,</q> declaring both their former and their present unbelief; whereby He implies Himself again to be equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, if at least the not believing Him makes it <q>adulterous.</q></p>
<p>2. Then, after His reproach, what says He? <q>There shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonas the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>.</q> Now is He striking the first note of the doctrine of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>, and confirming it by the type.</p>
<p>What then? One may say; was no sign given it? None was given to it on asking. For not to bring in them did He work His signs (for He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> them to be hardened), but in order to amend others. Either then this may be said, or that they were not to receive such a sign as that was. For a sign did befall them, when by their own punishment they learned His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200143.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">power</font></u></a>. Here then He speaks as threatening, and with this very meaning obscurely conveyed: as if He said, innumerable benefits have I showed forth, none of these has drawn you to me, neither were ye willing to adore my power. You shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> therefore my might by the contrary <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200143.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tokens</font></u></a>, when you shall see your city cast down to the ground, the walls also dismantled, the temple become a ruin; when you shall be cast out both from your former citizenship and freedom, and shall again go about everywhere, houseless and in exile. (For all these things came to pass after the cross.) These things therefore shall be to you for great signs. And indeed it is an exceeding great sign, that their ills remain unchanged; that although ten thousand have attempted it, no one has been able to reverse the judgment once gone forth against them.</p>
<p>All this however He says not, but leaves it to after time to make it clear to them, but for the present He is making trial of the doctrine of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>, which they were to come to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> by the things which they should afterwards suffer.</p>
<p><q>For as Jonas,</q> says He, <q>was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:40</font></u></a></span> Thus, He said not indeed openly that He should rise again, since they would have even laughed Him to scorn, but He intimated it in such manner, that they might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> Him to have foreknown it. For as to their being aware of it, they say to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a>, <q>That deceiver said,</q> these are their words, <q>while He was yet alive, After three days I will rise again;</q> and yet we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of this; even as they had been beforehand more void of understanding than these: wherefore also these became self-condemned.</p>
<p>But see how exactly He expresses it, even though in a dark saying. For He said not, <q>In the earth,</q> but, <q>In the heart of the earth;</q> that He might designate His very sepulchre, and that no one might suspect a mere semblance. And for this intent too did He allow three days, that the fact of His death might be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. For not by the cross only does He make it certain, and by the sight of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but also by the time of those days. For to the resurrection indeed all succeeding time was to bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, unless it had at the time many signs bearing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> to it, would have been disbelieved; and with this disbelief would have gone utter disbelief of the resurrection also. Therefore He calls it also a sign. But had He not been crucified, the sign would not have been given. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> too He brings forward the type, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> may be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. For tell me, was Jonah in the whale's belly a mere appearance? Nay, you can not say so. Therefore neither was Christ in the heart of the earth such. For surely the type is not in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> in mere appearance. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> we every where show forth His death, both in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>, and in all the rest. Therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also cries with a clear voice, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> forbid that I should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, save in the cross of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p>Whence it is clear, that they who are diseased in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09645c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Marcion's</font></u></a> way are children of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, blotting out these truths, to avoid the annulling whereof Christ did so many things, while to have them annulled the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> took such manifold pains: I mean, His cross and His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11530a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passion</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>3. Therefore He said elsewhere also, <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 2:19</font></u></a></span> and, The days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat009.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 9:15</font></u></a></span> and here, <q>There shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>:</q> declaring both that He should die and <q>the ox that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> his owner, and the ass that remembers his crib.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:3</font></u></a></span> Even so here too, when He had by a comparison set forth their perverseness, He speaks afterwards of their punishment also.</p>
<p>What then can the saying mean? As the possessed, says He, when delivered from that infirmity, should they be at all remiss, draw upon themselves their delusion more grievous than ever: even so is it with you. For before also you were possessed by a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, when you were worshipping <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, and were slaying your sons to the devils, exhibiting great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>; nevertheless I forsook you not, but cast out that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>; and again in my own person I have come, willing to cleanse you more entirely. Since then you will not attend, but have wrecked yourselves in greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> (for to kill <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> was a crime not nearly so great and grievous as to slay Him); therefore your sufferings will be more grievous than the former, those at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylon</font></u></a>, I mean, and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and under the first Antiochus. Because what things befell them in the time of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15379a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Vespasian</font></u></a> and Titus, were very far more grievous than those. Wherefore also He said, <q>There shall be great tribulation, such as never was, neither shall be.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:21</font></u></a></span> But not this only does the illustration declare, but that they should be also utterly destitute of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and more assailable by the power of the devils, than at that time. For then even although they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, yet were there also among them such as acted uprightly, and God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> was present with them, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, tending, correcting, fulfilling all its part; but now of this guardianship too they shall be utterly deprived; so He tells them; so that there is now both a greater scarcity of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and a more intense affliction, and a more tyrannical operation of the devils.</p>
<p>You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> accordingly even in our generation, when he who surpassed all in impiety, I mean Julian, was transported with his fury, how they ranged themselves with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathens</font></u></a>, how they courted their party. So that, even if they seem to be in some small degree chastened now, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the emperors makes them quiet; since, if it were not for that, far worse than the former had been their daring. For in all their other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> works they surpass their predecessors; sorceries, magic arts, impurities, they exhibit in great excess. And among the rest, moreover, strong as is the curb which holds them down, they have often made seditions, and risen up against kings, which has resulted in their being pierced through with the worst of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Where now are they that seek after signs? Let them hear that a considerate mind is needed, and if this be wanting, signs are of no profit. See, for instance, how the Ninevites without signs <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, while these, after so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, grew worse, and made themselves an habitation of innumerable devils, and brought on themselves ten thousand calamities; and very naturally. For when a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, being once delivered from his ills, fails to be corrected, he will suffer far worse than before. Yea, therefore He said, <q>he finds no rest,</q> to indicate, that positively and of necessity such an one will be overtaken by the ambush of the devils. Since surely by these two things he ought to have been sobered, by his former sufferings, and by his deliverance; or rather a third thing also is added, the threat of having still worse to endure. But yet by none of these were they made better.</p>
<p>5. All this might be seasonably said, not of them only, but of us also, when after having been enlightened, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb006.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 6:4</font></u></a></span> and delivered from our former ills, we again cleave unto the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, for more grievous also thenceforth will be the punishment of our subsequent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Therefore to the sick of the palsy also Christ said, <q>Behold, you are made whole; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> no more, lest a worse thing come unto you;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:14</font></u></a></span> and this to a man who was thirty-eight years in his infirmity. And what, one might ask, was he to suffer worse than this? Something far worse, and more intolerable. For far be it from us, that we should endure as much as we are capable of enduring. For God is at no loss for inflictions. For according to the greatness of His mercy, so also is His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>With this He charges Jerusalem also by Ezekiel. <q>I saw you,</q> says He, <q>polluted in blood; and I washed you, and anointed you; and you had renown for your beauty; and you poured out your fornications,</q> says He, <q>on those who dwell near you,</q> wherefore also the more grievous are His threatenings to you when you sin.</p>
<p>But from hence infer not your punishment only, but also the boundless longsuffering of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. How often at least have we put our hands to the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a>, and yet He suffers long! But let us not be sanguine, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; since <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a> too, had he been taught by the first plague, would not have experienced the later ones; he would not afterwards have been drowned, his host and all together.</p>
<p>And this I say, because I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> many, who like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a> are even now saying, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo005.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 5:2</font></u></a></span> and making those that are in their power cleave to the clay and to the bricks. How many, though God bids them assauge their <q>threatening,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 6:9</font></u></a></span> cannot bear so much as to relax the toil!</p>
<p><q>But we have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12688a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Red Sea</font></u></a> now, to pass through afterwards.</q> But we have a sea of fire, a sea not like that, either in kind or in size, but far greater and fiercer, having its waves of fire, of some strange and horrible fire. A great abyss is there, of most intolerable flame. Since everywhere fire may be seen roving quickly round, like some savage wild beast. And if here this sensible and material fire leaped like a wild beast out of the furnace, and sprang upon those who were sitting without, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan003.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 3:22</font></u></a></span> what will not that other fire do to such as have fallen into it?</p>
<p>Concerning that day, hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, saying, <q>The day of the Lord is incurable, full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa013.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 13:9</font></u></a></span> For there will be none to stand by, none to rescue, nowhere the face of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, so mild and calm. But as those who work in the mines are delivered over to certain cruel men, and see none of their friends, but those only that are set over them; so will it be then also: or rather not so, but even far more grievous. For here it is possible to go unto the king, and entreat, and free the condemned person: but there, no longer; for He permits it not, but they continue in the scorching torment, and in so great anguish, as it is not possible for words to tell. For if, when any are in flames here, no speech can describe their sharp pangs, much less theirs, who suffer it in that place: since here indeed all is over in a brief point of time, but in that place there is burning indeed, but what is burnt is not consumed.</p>
<p>What then shall we do there? For to my self also do I say these things.</p>
<p>6. <q>But if you,</q> says one, <q>who art our teacher, speak so of yourself, I care no more; for what wonder, should I be punished?</q> Nay, I entreat, let no man seek this consolation; for this is no refreshment at all. For tell me; was not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> an incorporeal power? Was he not superior to men? Yet he fell away. Is there any one who will derive consolation from being punished along with him? By no means. What of all who were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>? Did they not see those also punished who were in high places, and every house in mourning? Were they then hereby refreshed, and comforted? No surely; and it is manifest by what they did afterwards, as men tortured by some kind of fire, rising up together against the king, and compelling him to cast out the people of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Yea, and very unmeaning is this saying, to suppose that it gives comfort to be punished with all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, to say, <q>As all, so I too.</q> For why should I speak of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>? Think, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, of those that are seized with gout, how, when they are racked by sharp pain, though you show them ten thousand suffering worse, they do not so much as take it into their mind. For the intensity of their anguish allows not their reason any leisure for thinking of others, and so finding consolation. Let us not then feed ourselves with these cold hopes. For to receive consolation from the ills of our neighbors, takes place in ordinary sufferings; but when the torment is excessive, and all our inward parts full of tempest, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is now come to be unable so much as to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> itself, whence shall it derive consolation? So that all these sayings are an absurdity, and fables of foolish children. For this, of which you speak, takes place in dejection, and in moderate dejection, when we are told, <q>the same thing has befallen such an one;</q> but sometimes not even in dejection: now if in that case it has no strength, much less in the anguish and burden unspeakable, which <q>the gnashing of teeth</q> indicates.</p>
<p>And I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that I am galling you, and giving you pain by these words; but what can I do? For I would fain not speak thus, but be conscious of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> both in myself, and in all of you; but since we are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, the more part of us, who will grant me ability to pain you indeed, and to penetrate the understanding of them that hear me? Then might I so be at rest. But now I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> lest any despise my sayings, and their punishments become the greater for their indifferent way of hearing. Since, when a master utters a threat, should one of the fellow-servants hear and make light of his menace, not without punishment would he hasten by him, provoked as he is, but rather it would be a ground for increasing his chastisement. Wherefore I entreat you, let us pierce our own hearts, when we hear His sayings regarding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. For nothing is more delightful than this discourse, by how much nothing is more bitter than the reality. But how delightful to be told of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>? One may ask. Because it were so far from delight to fall into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, which result, our words that appear so galling, keep off. And before this they furnish another pleasure: in that they brace up our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, and make us more reverent, and elevate the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and give wings to the thoughts, and cast out the desires that so mischievously beset us; and the thing becomes a cure.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore, to proceed, together with the punishment let me speak also of the shame. For as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> shall then be condemned by the Ninevites, so we too by many that seem beneath us now.</p>
<p>Let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> then how great the mockery, how great the condemnation; let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a>, and cast some foundation at length, some door of repentance.</p>
<p>To myself I say these things, to myself first I give this advice, and let no one be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, as though he were condemned. Let us enter upon the narrow way. How long shall it be luxury? How long sloth? Have we not had enough of indolence, mirth, procrastination? Will it not be the same over again, feasting, and surfeiting, and expense, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and acquisitions, and buildings? And what is the end? Death. What is the end? Ashes, and dust, and coffins, and worms.</p>
<p>Let us show forth then a new kind of life. Let us make earth, heaven; let us hereby show the Greeks, of how great blessings they are deprived. For when they behold in us good conversation, they will look upon the very face of the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>. Yea, when they see us gentle, pure from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> desire, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, rightly fulfilling all our other duties, they will say, <q>If the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a> have become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> here, what will they be after their departure hence? If where they are strangers they shine so bright, how great will they become when they shall have won their native land!</q> Thus they too will be reformed, and the word of godliness <q>will have free course,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2th003.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Thessalonians 3:1</font></u></a></span> not less than in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles'</font></u></a> times. For if they, being twelve, converted entire cities and countries; were we all to become teachers by our careful conduct, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> how high our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> will be exalted. For not even a dead man raised so powerfully attracts the Greek, as a person practising self-denial. At that indeed he will be amazed, but by this he will be profited. That is done, and is past away; but this abides, and is constant culture to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Let us take heed therefore to ourselves, that we may gain them also. I say nothing burdensome. I say not, do not marry. I say not, forsake cities, and withdraw yourself from public affairs; but being engaged in them, show <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Yea, and such as are busy in the midst of cities, I would fain have more approved than such as have occupied the mountains. Wherefore? Because great is the profit thence arising. <q>For no man lights a candle, and sets it under the bushel.</q> Therefore I would that all the candles were set upon the candlestick, that the light might wax great.</p>
<p>Let us kindle then His fire; let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> them that are sitting in darkness to be delivered from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>. And tell me not, <q>I have a wife, and children belonging to me, and am master of a household, and cannot duly practise all this.</q> For though you had none of these, yet if you be careless, all is lost; though you are encompassed with all these, yet if you be earnest, you shall attain unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For there is but one thing that is wanted, the preparation of a generous mind; and neither age, nor poverty, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, nor reverse of fortune, nor anything else, will be able to impede you. Since in fact both old and young, and men having wives, and bringing up children, and working at crafts, and serving as soldiers, have duly performed all that is enjoined. For so Daniel was young, and Joseph a slave, and Aquila wrought at a craft, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> who sold purple was over a workshop, and another was the keeper of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, and another a centurion, as Cornelius; and another in ill health, as Timothy; and another a runaway, as Onesimus; but nothing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> an hindrance to any of these, but all were approved, both men and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, both young and old, both slaves and free, both soldiers and people.</p>
<p>Let us not then make vain pretexts, but let us provide a thoroughly good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and whatsoever we may be, we shall surely attain to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and arrive at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come; by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with whom be unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matt. XII. 46-49</font></u></a>.</strong></p>
<p><q><em>While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak with Him. Then one said unto Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brethren stand without, desiring to speak with You. But He answered and said unto him that told Him, Who is my mother, and</em> <em>my brethren? And He stretched forth His hand towards His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren.</em></q></p>
<p>That which I was lately saying, that when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is wanting all things are vain, this is now also pointed out very abundantly. For I indeed was saying, that age and nature, and to dwell in the wilderness, and all such things, are alike unprofitable, where there is not a good mind; but today we learn in addition another thing, that even to have borne Christ in the womb, and to have brought forth that marvellous birth, has no profit, if there be not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And this is hence especially manifest. <q>For while He yet talked to the people,</q> it is said, <q>one told Him, Your mother and Your brethren seek You. But He says, who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</q></p>
<p>And this He said, not as being ashamed of His mother, nor denying her that bare Him; for if He had been ashamed of her, He would not have passed through that womb; but as declaring that she has no advantage from this, unless she do all that is required to be done. For in fact that which she had essayed to do, was of superfluous vanity; in that she wanted to show the people that she has power and authority over her Son, imagining not as yet anything great concerning Him; whence also her unseasonable approach. See at all events both her self-confidence and theirs. Since when they ought to have gone in, and listened with the multitude; or if they were not so minded, to have waited for His bringing His discourse to an end, and then to have come near; they call Him out, and do this before all, evincing a superfluous vanity, and wishing to make it appear, that with much authority they enjoin Him. And this too the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> shows that he is blaming, for with this very allusion did he thus express himself, <q>While He yet talked to the people;</q> as if he should say, What? Was there no other opportunity? Why, was it not possible to speak with Him in private?</p>
<p>And what was it they wished to say? For if it were touching the doctrines of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, they ought to have propounded these things publicly, and stated them before all, that the rest also might have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200144.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">benefit</font></u></a>: but if about other matters that concerned themselves, they ought not to have been so urgent. For if He suffered not the burial of a father, lest the attendance on Him should be interrupted, much less ought they to have stopped His discourse to the people, for things that were of no importance. Whence it is clear, that nothing but vainglory led them to do this; which John too declares, by saying, <q>Neither did His brethren <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh007.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 7:5</font></u></a></span> and some sayings too of theirs he reports, full of great folly; telling us that they were for dragging Him to Jerusalem, for no other purpose, but that they themselves might reap <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> from His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. <q>For if you do these things,</q> it is said, <q>show Yourself to the world. For there is no man that does anything in secret, and seeks himself to be manifest;</q> when also He Himself rebuked them, attributing it to their carnal mind. That is, because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were reproaching Him, and saying, <q>Is not this the carpenter's son, whose father and mother we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>? And His brethren, are not they with us?</q> they, willing to throw off the disparagement caused by His birth, were calling Him to the display of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> He quite repels them, being minded to heal their infirmity; since surely, had it been His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> to deny His mother, He would have denied her then, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were reproaching Him. But as it is, we see that He takes so great care of her, as even at the very cross to commit her to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> whom He loved most of all, and to give him a great charge concerning her.</p>
<p>But now He does not so, out of care for her, and for His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200144.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">brethren</font></u></a>. I mean, because their regard for Him was as towards a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200144.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mere man</font></u></a>, and they were vainglorious, He casts out the disease, not insulting, but correcting them.</p>
<p>But do thou, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, examine not the words only, which contain a moderate reproof, but also the unbecoming conduct of His brethren, and the boldness wherewith they had been bold and who was the person reproving it, no mere man, but the only-begotten <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>; and with what purpose He reproved; that it was not with intent to drive them to perplexity, but to deliver them from the most tyrannical passion and to lead them on little by little to the right idea concerning Himself, and to convince her that He was not her Son only, but also her Lord: so will you perceive that the reproof is in the highest degree both becoming Him and profitable to her, and withal having in it much gentleness. For He said not, <q>Go your way, tell my mother, you are not my mother,</q> but He addresses Himself to the person that told Him; saying, <q>Who is my mother?</q> together with the things that have been mentioned providing for another object also. What then is that? That neither they nor others confiding in their kindred, should neglect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For if she is nothing profited by being His mother, were it not for that quality in her, hardly will any one else be saved by his kindred. For there is one only nobleness, to do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. This kind of noble birth is better than the other, and more real.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> therefore these things, let us neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> ourselves on children that are of good report, unless we have their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; nor upon noble fathers, unless we be like them in disposition. For it is possible, both that he who begot a man should not be his father, and that he who did not beget him should be. Therefore in another place also, when some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> had said, <q>Blessed is the womb that bare You, and the paps which You have sucked;</q> He said not, <q>The womb bare me not, neither did I suck the paps,</q> but this, <q>Yea rather, blessed are they that do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of my Father.</q> Do you see how on every occasion He denies not the affinity by nature, but adds that by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>? And His forerunner too, in saying, <q>O generation of vipers, think not to say, We have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> to our father,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:7, 9</font></u></a></span> means not this, that they were not naturally of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, but that it profits them nothing to be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, unless they had the affinity by character; which Christ also declared, when He said, <q>If you were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> children, you would do the works of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh008.htm#verse39" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 8:39</font></u></a></span> not depriving them of their kindred according to the flesh, but teaching them to seek after that affinity which is greater than it, and more real.</p>
<p>This then He establishes here also, but in a manner less invidious, and more measured, as became Him speaking to His mother. For He said not at all, <q>She is not my mother, nor are those my brethren, because they do not my will;</q> neither did He declare and pronounce judgment against them; but He yet left in it their own power to choose, speaking with the gentleness that becomes Him.</p>
<p><q>For he that does,</q> says He, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of my Father, this is my brother, and sister, and mother.</q> </p>
<p>Wherefore if they desire to be such, let them come this way. And when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> again cried out, saying, <q>Blessed is the womb that bare You,</q> He said not, <q>She is not my mother,</q> but, <q>If she wishes to be blessed, let her do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of my Father. For such a one is both brother, and sister, and mother.</q></p>
<p>Oh <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>! Oh <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>! Unto what a height does she lead up him that follows after her! How many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> have blessed that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> Virgin, and her womb, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> that they might become such mothers, and give up all! What then is there to hinder? For behold, He has marked out a spacious road for us; and it is granted not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> only, but to men also, to be of this rank, or rather of one yet far higher. For this makes one His mother much more, than those pangs did. So that if that were a subject for blessing, much more this, inasmuch as it is also more real. Do not therefore merely desire, but also in the way that leads you to your desire walk thou with much diligence.</p>
<p>3. Having then said these words, <q>He came out of the house.</q> Do you see, how He both rebuked them, and did what they desired? Which He did also at the marriage. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh002.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 2:1-11</font></u></a></span> For there too He at once reproved her asking unseasonably, and nevertheless did not gainsay her; by the former correcting her weakness, by the latter showing His kindly feeling toward His mother. So likewise on this occasion too, He both healed the disease of vainglory, and rendered the due <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to His mother, even though her request was unseasonable. For, <q>in the same day,</q> it is said, <q>went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</q> </p>
<p>Why, if you desire, says He, to see and hear, behold I come forth and discourse. Thus having wrought many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, He affords again the benefit of His doctrine. And He <q>sits by the sea,</q> fishing and getting into His net them that are on the land.</p>
<p>But He <q>sat by the sea,</q> not without a purpose; and this very thing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> has darkly expressed. For to indicate that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of His doing this was a desire to order His auditory with exactness, and to leave no one behind His back, but to have all face to face,</p>
<p><q>And great multitudes,</q> says He, <q>were gathered together unto Him, so that He went into a ship and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</q> </p></div>

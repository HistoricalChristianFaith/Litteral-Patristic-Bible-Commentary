<p>And having sat down there, He speaks by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>And He spoke,</q> it says, <q>many things unto them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>

<p>And yet on the mount, we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, He did no such thing, neither did He weave His discourse with so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, for then there were multitudes only, and a simple people; but here are also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scribes</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray you, what kind of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> He speaks first, and how Matthew puts them in their order. Which then does He speak first? That which it was most necessary to speak first, that which makes the hearer more attentive. For because He was to discourse unto them in dark sayings, He thoroughly rouses His hearers' mind first by His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. Therefore also another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> says that He reproved them, because they do not understand; saying, <q>How <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> ye not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>?</q> But not for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> only does He speak in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, but that He may also make His discourse more vivid, and fix the memory of it in them more perfectly, and bring the things before their sight. In like manner do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> also.</p>
<p>4. What then is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>? <q>Behold,</q> says He, <q>a sower went forth to sow.</q> Whence went He forth, who is present everywhere, who fills all things? Or how went He forth? Not in place, but in condition and dispensation to usward, coming nearer to us by His clothing Himself with flesh. For because we could not enter, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> fencing us out from the entrance, He comes forth unto us. And wherefore came He forth? To destroy the ground teeming with thorns? To take vengeance upon the husbandmen? By no means; but to till and tend it, and to sow the word of godliness. For by seed here He means His doctrine, and by land, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and by the sower, Himself.</p>
<p>What then comes of this seed? Three parts perish, and one is saved.</p>
<p><q>And when He sowed, some seeds fell,</q> He says, <q>by the way side; and the fowls came and devoured them up.</q> </p>
<p>He said not, that He cast them, but that <q>they fell.</q></p>
<p><q>And some upon the rock, where they had not much earth; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up, and choked them. But others fell on the good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who has ears to hear let him hear.</q> </p>
<p>A fourth part is saved; and not this all alike, but even here great is the difference.</p>
<p>Now these things He said, manifesting that He discoursed to all without grudging. For as the sower makes no distinction in the land submitted to him, but simply and indifferently casts his seed; so He Himself too makes no distinction of rich and poor, of wise and unwise, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a> or diligent, of brave or cowardly; but He discourses unto all, fulfilling His part, although foreknowing the results; that it may be in His power to say, <q>What ought I to have done, that I have not done?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 5:4</font></u></a></span> And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> speak of the people as of a vine; <q>For my beloved,</q> it is said, <q>had a vineyard;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa005.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 5:1</font></u></a></span> and, <q>He brought a vine out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>;</q> but He, as of seed. What could this be to show? That <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> now will be quick and easier, and will presently yield its fruit.</p>
<p>But when you hear, <q>The sower went forth to sow,</q> think it not a needless repetition. For the sower frequently goes forth for some other act also, either to plough, or to cut out the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> herbs, or to pluck up thorns, or to attend to some such matter; but He went forth to sow.</p>
<p>Whence then, tell me, was the greater part of the seed lost? Not through the sower, but through the ground that received it; that is, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that did not hearken.</p>
<p>And wherefore does He not say, Some the careless received, and lost it; some the rich, and choked it, and some the superficial, and betrayed it? It is not His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> to rebuke them severely, lest He should cast them into despair, but He leaves the reproof to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> of His hearers.</p>
<p>And this was not the case with the seed only, but also with the net; for that too produced many that were unprofitable.</p>
<p>5. But this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> He speaks, as anointing His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and to teach them, that even though the lost be more than such as receive the word yet they are not to despond. For this was the ease even with their Lord, and He who fully foreknew that these things should be, did not desist from sowing.</p>
<p>And how can it be reasonable, says one, to sow among the thorns, on the rock, on the wayside? With regard to the seeds and the earth it cannot be reasonable; but in the case of men's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> and their instructions, it has its praise, and that abundantly. For the husbandman indeed would reasonably be blamed for doing this; it being impossible for the rock to become earth, or the wayside not to be a wayside, or the thorns, thorns; but in the things that have reason it is not so. There is such a thing as the rock changing, and becoming rich land; and the wayside being no longer trampled on, nor lying open to all that pass by, but that it may be a fertile field; and the thorns may be destroyed, and the seed enjoy full security. For had it been impossible, this Sower would not have sown. And if the change did not take place in all, this is no fault of the Sower, but of them who are unwilling to be changed: He having done His part: and if they betrayed what they received of Him, He is blameless, the exhibitor of such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to man.</p>
<p>But do thou mark this, I pray you; that the way of destruction is not one only, but there are differing ones, and wide apart from one another. For they that are like the wayside are the coarse-minded, and indifferent, and careless; but those on the rock such as fail from weakness only.</p>
<p>For <q>that which is sown upon the stony places,</q> says He, <q>the same is he that hears the word, and anon with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> receives it. Yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while; but when tribulation or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecution</font></u></a> arises because of the word, by and by he is offended! When any one,</q> so He says, <q>hears the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> and understands it not, then comes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> one, and catches that which was sown out of his heart. This is he that is sown by the wayside.</q> </p>
<p>Now it is not the same thing for the doctrine to wither away, when no man is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> entreating, or disturbing its foundations, as when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a> press upon one. But they that are likened to the thorns, are much more inexcusable than these.</p>
<p>6. In order then that none of these things may befall us, let us by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> and continual remembrance cover up the things that are told us. For though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> do catch them away, yet it rests with us, whether they be caught away; though the plants wither, yet it is not from the heat this takes place (for He did not say, because of the heat it withered, but, <q>because it had no root</q>); although His sayings are choked, it is not because of the thorns, but of them who suffer them to spring up. For there is a way, if you will, to check this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> growth, and to make the right use of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. Therefore He said not, <q>the world,</q> but <q>the care of the world;</q> nor <q>riches,</q> but <q>the deceitfulness of riches.</q></p>
<p>Let us not then blame the things, but the corrupt mind. For it is possible to be rich and not to be deceived; and to be in this world, and not to be choked with its cares. For indeed riches have two contrary disadvantages; one, care, wearing us out, and bringing a darkness over us; the other, luxury, making us effeminate.</p>
<p>And well has He said, <q>The deceitfulness of riches.</q> For all that pertains to riches is deceit; they are names only, not attached to things. For so pleasure and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and splendid array, and all these things, are a sort of vain show, not a reality.</p>
<p>Having therefore spoken of the ways of destruction, afterwards He mentions the good ground, not suffering them to despair, but giving a hope of repentance, and indicating that it is possible to change from the things before mentioned into this.</p>
<p>And yet if both the land be good, and the Sower one, and the seed the same, wherefore did one bear a hundred, one sixty, one thirty? Here again the difference is from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the ground, for even where the ground is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, great even therein is the difference. Do you see, that not the husbandman is to be blamed, nor the seed, but the land that receives it? Not for its nature, but for its disposition. And herein too, great is His mercy to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, that He does not require one measure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but while He receives the first, and casts not out the second, He gives also a place to the third.</p>
<p>And these things He says, least they that followed Him should suppose that hearing is sufficient for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. And wherefore, one may say, did He not put the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vices</font></u></a> also, such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, vainglory? In speaking of <q>the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,</q> He set down all. Yea, both vainglory and all the rest belong to this world, and to the deceitfulness of riches; such as pleasure, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, and vainglory, and all the like.</p>
<p>But He added also the <q>way</q> and the <q>rock,</q> signifying that it is not enough to be freed from riches only, but we must cultivate also the other parts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For what if you are free indeed from riches, yet are soft and unmanly? And what if you are not indeed unmanly, but art remiss and careless about the hearing of the word? Nay, no one part is sufficient for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, but there is required first a careful hearing, and a continual recollection; then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>, then contempt of riches, and deliverance from all worldly things.</p>
<p>In fact, His reason for putting this before the other, is because the one is first required (for <q>How shall they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> except they hear?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:14</font></u></a></span> just as we too, except we mind what is said, shall not be able so much as to learn what we ought to do): after that, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>, and the contempt of things present.</p>
<p>7. Hearing therefore these things, let us fortify ourselves on all sides, regarding His instructions, and striking our roots deep, and cleansing ourselves from all worldly things. But if we do the one, neglecting the other, we shall be nothing bettered; for though we perish not in one way, yet shall we in some other. For what signifies our not being ruined by riches, if we are by indolence: or not by indolence, if we are by softness. For so the husbandman, whether this way or that way he lose his crop, equally bewails himself. Let us not then soothe ourselves upon our not perishing in all these ways, but let it be our grief, in whichever way we are perishing.</p>
<p>And let us burn up the thorns, for they choke the word. And this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to those rich men, who not for these matters alone, but for others also prove unprofitable. For having become slaves and captives of their pleasures, they are useless even for civil affairs, and if for them, much more for those of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>. Yea, and in two ways hereby our thoughts are corrupted; both by the luxury, and by the anxiety too. For either of these by itself were enough to overwhelm the bark; but when even both concur, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> how high the billow swells.</p>
<p>And marvel not at His calling our luxury, <q>thorns.</q> For thou indeed art not aware of it, being intoxicated with your passion, but they that are in sound health <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that it pricks sharper than any thorn, and that luxury wastes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> worse than care, and causes more grievous pains both to body and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. For one is not so sorely smitten by anxiety, as by surfeiting. Since when watchings, and throbbings of the temples, and heaviness in the head, and pangs of the bowels, lay hold of such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> how many thorns these surpass in grievousness. And as the thorns, on whichever side they are laid hold of, draw blood from the hands that seize them, just so does luxury plague both feet, and hands, and head, and eyes, and in general all our members; and it is withered also, and unfruitful, like the thorn, and hurts much more than it, and in our vital parts. Yea, it brings on premature old age, and dulls the senses, and darkens our reasoning, and blinds the keen-sighted <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and makes the body tumid, rendering excessive the deposition of that which is cast away, and gathering together a great accumulation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>; and it makes the burden too great, and the load overwhelming; whence our falls are many and continual, and our shipwrecks frequent.</p>
<p>For tell me, why pamper your body? What? Are we to slay you in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, to set you on the table? The birds it is well for you to pamper: or rather, not so well even for them; for when they are fattened, they are unprofitable for wholesome food. So great an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is luxury, that its mischief is shown even in irrational beings. For even them by luxury we make unprofitable, both to themselves and to us. For their superfluous flesh is indigestible, and the moister kind of corruption is engendered by that kind of fatness. Whereas the creatures that are not so fed, but live, as one may say, in abstinence, and moderate diet, and in labor and hardship, these are most serviceable both to themselves and to others, as well for food, as for everything else. Those, at any rate, who live on them, are in better health; but such as are fed on the others are like them, growing dull and sickly, and rendering their chain more grievous. For nothing is so hostile and hurtful to the body, as luxury; nothing so tears it in pieces, and overloads and corrupts it, as intemperance.</p>
<p>Wherefore above all may this circumstance make one amazed at them for their folly, that not even so much care as others show towards their wine skins, are these willing to evince towards themselves. For those the wine merchants do not allow to receive more than is fit, lest they should burst; but to their own wretched belly these men do not vouchsafe even so much forethought, but when they have stuffed it and distended it, they fill all, up to the ears, up to the nostrils, to the very throat itself, thereby pressing into half its room the spirit, and the power that directs the living being. What? Was your throat given you for this end, that you should fill it up to the very mouth, with wine turned sour, and all other corruption? Not for this, O man, but that you should above all things sing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and offer up the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, and read out the divine <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, and give to your neighbors profitable counsel. But you, as if you had received it for this end, dost not suffer it to have leisure for that ministry, so much as for a short season, but for all your life subjectest it to this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> slavery. And as if any man having had a lyre given him with golden strings, and beautifully constructed, instead of awakening with it the most harmonious music, were to cover it over with much dung and clay; even so do these men. Now the word, dung, I use not of living, but of luxurious living, and of that great wantonness. Because what is more than necessary is not nourishment, but merely injurious. For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> the belly alone was made merely for the reception of food; but the month, and the throat, and tongue, for other things also, far more necessary than these: or rather, not even the belly for the reception of food simply, but for the reception of moderate food. And this it makes manifest by crying out loudly against us, when we tease it by this greediness; nor does it clamor against us only, but also avenging that wrong exacts of us the severest penalty. And first it punishes the feet, that bear and conduct us to those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> revels, then the hands that minister to it, binding them together for having brought unto it such quantities and kinds of provisions; and many have distorted even their very mouth, and eyes, and head. And as a servant receiving an order beyond his power, not seldom out of desperation becomes insolent to the giver of the order: so the belly too, together with these members, often ruins and destroys, from being over-strained, the very brain itself. And this God has well ordered, that from excess so much mischief should arise; that when of your own will thou dost not practise self-restraint, at least against your will, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of so great ruin, you may learn to be moderate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> then these things, let us flee luxury, let us study moderation, that we may both enjoy health of body, and having delivered our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> from all infirmity, may attain unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p>We have good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to admire the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, how, longing as they do to learn, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> when they ought to ask. For they do it not before all: and this Matthew shows by saying, <q>And they came.</q> And, as to this assertion not being conjecture, Mark has expressed it more distinctly, by saying, that <q>they came to Him privately.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar004.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 4:10</font></u></a></span> This then His brethren and His mother should also have done, and not have called Him out, and made a display.</p>
<p>But mark their kindly affection also, how they have much regard for the others, and seek their good first, and then their own. <q>For why,</q> it is said, <q>do You speak unto them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>?</q> They did not say, why do you speak unto us in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>? Yea, and on other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200145.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">occasions</font></u></a> also their kindliness towards men appears in many ways; as when they say, <q>Send the multitude away;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk009.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 9:12</font></u></a></span> and, <q>Do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that they were offended?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat015.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 15:12</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>What then says Christ? <q>Because it is given unto you,</q> so He speaks, <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> of the Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, but to them it is not given.</q> But this He said, not bringing in necessity, or any allotment made causelessly and at random, but implying them to be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200145.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">authors</font></u></a> of all their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, and wishing to represent that the thing is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200145.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gift</font></u></a>, and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> bestowed from above.</p>
<p>It by no means follows, however, because it is a gift, that therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free will</font></u></a> is taken away; and this is evident from what comes after. To this purpose, in order that neither the one sort may despair, nor the other grow careless, upon being told that <q>it is given,</q> He signifies the beginning to be with ourselves.</p>
<p><q>For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken away, even that which he seems to have.</q> </p>
<p>And although the saying be full of much obscurity, yet it indicates unspeakable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>. For what He says is like this: When any one has forwardness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>, there shall be given unto him all things on God's part also: but if he be void of these, and contribute not his own share, neither are God's gifts bestowed. For even <q>what he seems to have,</q> so He says, <q>shall be taken away from him;</q> God not so much taking it away, as counting him unworthy of His gifts. This we also do; when we see any one listening carelessly, and when with much entreaty we cannot persuade him to attend, it remains for us to be silent. For if we are still to go on, his carelessness is aggravated. But him that is striving to learn, we lead on, and pour in much.</p>
<p>And well said He, <q>Even that which he seems to have.</q> For he has not really even this.</p>
<p>Then He also made what He had said more distinct, pointing out the meaning of, <q>To him that has, shall be given, but from him that has not, even that which he seems to have, shall be taken away.</q></p>
<p><q>Therefore,</q> says He, <q>speak I to them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>; because they seeing see not.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:13</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p><q>It were meet then,</q> one may say, <q>to have opened their eyes, if they see not.</q> Nay, if the blindness were natural, it were meet to open them; but because it was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15506a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">voluntary</font></u></a> and self-chosen blindness, therefore He said not simply, <q>They see not,</q> but, <q>seeing, they see not;</q> so that the blindness is of their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. For they saw even devils cast out, and said, <q>By <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a>, prince of the devils, He casts out the devils.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:14</font></u></a></span> They heard Him guiding them unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and evincing His great unanimity with Him, and they say, <q>This man is not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh009.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 9:16</font></u></a></span> Since then the judgment they pronounced was contrary both to their sight and hearing, therefore, says He, the very hearing do I take away from them. For they derive thence no advantage, but rather greater condemnation. For they not only disbelieved, but found fault also, and accused, and laid snares. However, He says not this, for it is not His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> to give disgust in accusing them. Therefore neither at the beginning did He so discourse to them, but with much plainness; but because they perverted themselves, thenceforth He speaks in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>2. After this, lest any one should suppose His words to be a mere accusation, and lest men should say, Being our enemy He is bringing these charges and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumnies</font></u></a> against us; He introduces the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> also, pronouncing the same judgment as Himself.</p>
<p><q>For in them is fulfilled,</q> says He, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> of Esaias, which says, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.</q> </p>
<p>Do you see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> likewise, accusing them with this same accuracy? For neither did He say, You see not, but <q>You shall see and not perceive;</q> nor again, You shall not hear, but <q>You shall hear and not understand.</q> So that they first inflicted the loss on themselves, by stopping their ears, by closing their eyes, by making their heart fat. For they not only failed to hear, but also <q>heard heavily,</q> and they did this, He says,</p>
<p><q>Lest at any time they should be converted, and I should heal them;</q> describing their aggravated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, and their determined defection from Him. And this He says to draw them unto Him, and to provoke them, and to signify that if they would convert He would heal them: much as if one should say, <q>He would not look at me, and I thank him; for if he had vouchsafed me this, I should straightway have given in:</q> and this he says, to signify how he would have been reconciled. Even so then here too it is said, <q>Lest at any time they should convert, and I should heal them;</q> implying that both their conversion was possible, and that upon their repentance they might be saved, and that not for His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, but for their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, He was doing all things.</p>
<p>For if it had not been His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> that they should hear and be saved, He ought to have been silent, not to have spoken in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>; but now by this very thing He stirs them up, even by speaking under a veil. <q>For God wills not the death of the sinner, but that he should turn unto Him and live.</q> </p>
<p>For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> belongs not to nature, nor to necessity and compulsion, hear what He says to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, <q>But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear;</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:16</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>not meaning this kind of sight nor hearing, but that of the mind. For indeed these too were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and brought up in the same circumstances; but nevertheless they took no hurt from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, because they had the root of His blessings well settled in them, their principle of choice, I mean, and their judgment.</p>
<p>Do you see that, <q>unto you it is given,</q> was not of necessity? For neither would they have been blessed, unless the well-doing had been their own. For tell me not this, that it was spoken obscurely; for they might have come and asked Him, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> did: but they would not, being careless and supine. Why say I, they would not? Nay, they were doing the very opposite, not only disbelieving, not only not hearkening, but even waging <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and disposed to be very bitter against all He said: which He brings in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> laying to their charge, in the words, <q>They heard heavily.</q></p>
<p>But not such were these; wherefore He also blessed them. And in another way too He assures them again, saying,</p>
<p><q>For verily I say unto you, many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them;</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:17</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>my coming, He means; my very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, my voice, my teaching. For here He prefers them not to these depraved only, but even to such as have done virtuously; yea, and He affirms them to be more blessed even than they. Why can this be? Because not only do these see what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> saw not, but even what those of old desired to see. For they indeed beheld by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> only: but these by sight too, and much more distinctly.</p>
<p>Do you see how again He connects the old dispensation with the new, signifying that those of old not only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the things to come but also greatly desired them? But had they pertained to some strange and opposing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, they would never have desired them.</p>
<p><q>Hear ye therefore the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the sower,</q></p>

<p>says He; and He speaks what we before mentioned, of carelessness and attention, of cowardice and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15506a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">voluntary</font></u></a> poverty; pointing out the hurt from the one, and the benefit from the other.</p>
<p>Then of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> also He brings forward different forms. For being full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, He marked out not one only way, nor did He say, <q>unless one bring forth an hundred, he is an outcast;</q> but he that brings forth sixty is saved also, and not he only, but also the producer of thirty. And this He said, making out <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> to be easy.</p>
<p>3. And thou then, are you unable to practise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virginity</font></u></a>? Be chaste in marriage. Are you unable to strip yourself of your possessions? Give of your substance. Can you not bear that burden? Share your goods with Christ. Are you unwilling to yield Him up all? Give Him but the half, but the third part. He is your brother, and joint-heir, make Him joint-heir with you here too. Whatsoever you give Him, you will give to yourself. Do you not hear what says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>? <q>Them that pertain to your seed you shall not overlook.</q> But if we must not overlook our kinsmen, much less our Lord, having towards you, together with His authority as Lord, the claim also of kindred, and many more besides. Yea, for He too has made you a sharer in His goods, having received nothing of you, but having begun with this unspeakable benefit. What then can it be but extreme senselessness, not even by this gift to be made kind towards men, not even to give a return for a free gift, and less things for greater? Thus whereas He has made you heir of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, do you not impart to Him even of the things on earth? He, when you had done no good work, but were even an enemy, reconciled you: and do you not requite Him, being even a friend and benefactor?</p>
<p>Yet surely, even antecedently to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200145.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom</font></u></a>, and to all the rest, even for the very fact of His giving, we ought to feel bound to Him. For so servants too, when bidding their masters to a meal, account themselves not to be giving but receiving; but here the contrary has taken place: not the servant the Lord, but the Lord has first bidden the servant unto His own table; and do you not bid Him, no not even after this? He first has introduced you under His own roof; do you not take Him in, so much as in the second place? He clad you, being naked; and do you not even after this receive Him being a stranger? He first gave you to drink out of His own cup, and do you not impart to Him so much as cold water? He has made you drink of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, and do you not even soothe His bodily thirst? He has made you drink of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, when you were deserving of punishment; and do you neglect Him even when thirsty, and this when it is out of His own, that you are to do all these things? Do you not then esteem it a great thing, to hold the cup out of which Christ is to drink, and to put it to His lips? Do you see not that for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> alone is it lawful to give the cup of His blood? But I am by no means strict about this, says He; but though yourself should give, I receive; though thou be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">layman</font></u></a>, I refuse it not. And I do not require such as I have given: for not blood do I seek, but cold water. Consider to whom you are giving drink, and tremble. Consider, you have become a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, giv ing with your own hand, not flesh but bread, not blood, but a cup of cold water. He clothed you with a garment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and clothed you by Himself; do thou at least by your servant clothe Him. He made you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, do thou deliver Him from shivering, and nakedness, and shame. He made you a fellow-citizen of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, do thou impart to Him at least of the covering of your roof, give house-room to Him at least as to your own servant. <q>I refuse not this lodging and that, having opened to you the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>. I have delivered you from a most grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>; this I do not require again, nor do I say, deliver me; but if you would look upon me only, when I am bound, this suffices me for refreshment. When thou were dead, I raised you; I require not this again of you, but I say, visit me only when sick.</q></p>
<p>Now when His gifts are so great, and His demands exceeding easy, and we do not supply even these; what deep of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> must we not deserve? Justly shall we depart into the fire that is prepared for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, being more insensible than any rock. For how great insensibility is it, tell me, for us, who have received, and are to receive so much, to be slaves of money, from which we shall a little while hence be separated even against our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>? And others indeed have given up even their life, and shed their blood; and do you not even give up your superfluities for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven's</font></u></a> sake, for the sake of so great crowns?</p>
<p>And of what favor can you be worthy? Of what justification? Who in your sowing of the earth, gladly pourest forth all, and in lending to men at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15235c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">usury</font></u></a> sparest nothing; but in feeding your Lord through His poor art cruel and inhuman?</p>
<p>Having then considered all these things, and calculated what we have received, what we are to receive, what is required of us, let us show forth all our diligence on the things spiritual. Let us become at length mild and humane, that we may not draw down on ourselves the intolerable punishment. For what is there that has not power to condemn us? Our having enjoyed so many and such great benefits; our having no great thing required of us; our having such things required, as we shall leave here even against our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>; our exhibiting so much liberality in our worldly matters. Why each one of these, even by itself, were enough to condemn us; but when they all meet together, what hope will there be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>In order then that we may escape all this condemnation, let us show forth some bounty towards those who are in need. For thus shall we enjoy all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, both here, and there; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matt. XIII. 24-30</font></u></a>.</strong></p>
<p><em><q>Another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> put He forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Whence then has it tares? He said unto them, An enemy has done this. The servants said unto him, Will you then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat with them. Let both therefore grow together until the harvest.</q></em> </p>
<p>What is the difference between this, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> before it? There He speaks of them that have not at all holden with Him, but have started aside, and have thrown away the seed; but here He means the societies of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>. For in order that not even this might disturb His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, He foretells it also, after having taught them why He speaks in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>. The former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> then means their not receiving Him; this, their receiving corrupters. For indeed this also is a part of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil's</font></u></a> craft, by the side of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> always to bring in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, painting thereon many resemblances, so as easily to cheat the deceivable. Therefore He calls it not any other seed, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200146.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tares</font></u></a>; which in appearance are somewhat like wheat.</p>
<p>Then He mentions also the manner of his device. For <q>while men slept,</q> says He. It is no small danger, which He hereby suspends over our rulers, to whom especially is entrusted the keeping of the field; and not the rulers only, but the subjects too.</p>
<p>And He signifies also that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> comes after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, which the actual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200146.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">event</font></u></a> testifies. For so after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>; and after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, the false <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>; and after Christ, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01559a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Antichrist</font></u></a>. For unless the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> see what to imitate, or against whom to plot, he neither attempts, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how. Now then also, having seen that <q>one brought forth a hundred, another sixty, another thirty,</q> he proceeds after that another way. That is, not having been able to carry away what had taken root, nor to choke, nor to scorch it up, he conspires against it by another craft, privily casting in his own inventions.</p>
<p>And what difference is there, one may say, between them that sleep, and them that resemble the wayside? That in the latter case he immediately caught it away; yea, he suffered it not even to take root; but here more of his craft was needed.</p>
<p>And these things Christ says, instructing us to be always wakeful. For, says He, though thou quite escape those harms, there is yet another harm. For as in those instances <q>the wayside,</q> and <q>the rock,</q> and <q>the thorns,</q> so here again sleep occasions our ruin; so that there is need of continual watchfulness. Wherefore He also said, <q>He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:22</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Something like this took place even at the beginning. Many of the prelates, I mean, bringing into the churches <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200146.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, disguised heresiarchs, gave great facility to the laying that kind of snare. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> needs not even to take any trouble, when he has once planted them among us.</p>
<p>And how is it possible not to sleep? One may say. Indeed, as to natural sleep, it is not possible; but as to that of our moral faculty, it is possible. Wherefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also said, <q>Watch ye, stand fast in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co016.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 16:13</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>After this He points out the thing to be superfluous too, not hurtful only; in that, after the land has been tilled, and there is no need of anything, then this enemy sows again; as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a> also do, who for no other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> than vainglory inject their proper venom.</p>
<p>And not by this only, but by what follows likewise, He depicts exactly all their acting. For, <q>When the blade was sprung up,</q> says He, <q>and brought forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200146.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fruit</font></u></a>, then appeared the tares also;</q> which kind of thing these men also do. For at the beginning they disguise themselves; but when they have gained much confidence, and some one imparts to them the teaching of the word, then they pour out their poison.</p>
<p>But wherefore does He bring in the servants, telling what has been done? That He may pronounce it wrong to slay them.</p>
<p>And He calls him <q>an enemy,</q> because of his harm done to men. For although the despite is against us, in its origin it sprang from his enmity, not to us, but to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Whence it is manifest, that God loves us more than we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> ourselves.</p>
<p>And see from another thing also, the malicious craft of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. For he did not sow before this, because he had nothing to destroy, but when all had been fulfilled, that he might defeat the diligence of the Husbandman; in such enmity against Him did he constantly act.</p>
<p>And mark also the affection of the servants. I mean, what haste they are in at once to root up the tares, even though they do it indiscreetly; which shows their anxiety for the crop, and that they are looking to one thing only, not to the punishment of that enemy, but to the preservation of the seed sown. For of course this other is not the urgent consideration.</p>
<p>Wherefore how they may for the present extirpate the mischief, this is their object. And not even this do they seek absolutely, for they trust not themselves with it, but await the Master's decision, saying, <q>Will You?</q></p>
<p>What then does the Master? He forbids them, saying, <q>Lest haply ye root up the wheat with them.</q> And this He said, to hinder <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> from arising, and blood and slaughter. For it is not right to put a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a> to death, since an implacable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> would be brought into the world. By these two reasons then He restrains them; one, that the wheat be not hurt; another, that punishment will surely overtake them, if incurably diseased. Wherefore, if you would have them punished, yet without harm to the wheat, I bid you wait for the proper season.</p>
<p>But what means, <q>Lest ye root up the wheat with them?</q> Either He means this, If you are to take up arms, and to kill the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, many of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> also must needs be overthrown with them; or that of the very tares it is likely that many may change and become wheat. If therefore ye root them up beforehand, you injure that which is to become wheat, slaying some, in whom there is yet room for change and improvement. He does not therefore forbid our checking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, and stopping their mouths, and taking away their freedom of speech, and breaking up their assemblies and confederacies, but our killing and slaying them.</p>
<p>But mark thou His gentleness, how He not only gives sentence and forbids, but sets down reasons.</p>
<p>What then, if the tares should remain until the end? <q>Then I will say to the reapers, Gather together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:30</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>He again reminds them of John's words, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:12</font></u></a></span> introducing Him as judge; and He says, So long as they stand by the wheat, we must spare them, for it is possible for them even to become wheat but when they have departed, having profited nothing, then of necessity the inexorable punishment will overtake them. <q>For I will say to the reapers,</q> says He, <q>Gather ye together first the tares.</q> Why, <q>first?</q> That these may not be alarmed, as though the wheat were carried off with them. <q>And bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</q> </p>
<p>2. <q>Another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> put He forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is like to a grain of mustard seed.</q> </p>
<p>That is, since He had said, that of the crop three parts are lost, and but one saved, and in the very part again which is saved so great damage ensues; lest they should say, <q>And who, and how many will be the faithful?</q> this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> again He removes, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the mustard seed leading them on to belief, and signifying that in any case the gospel shall be spread abroad.</p>
<p>Therefore He brought forward the similitude of this herb, which has a very strong resemblance to the subject in hand; <q>Which indeed is the least,</q> He says, <q>of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</q> </p>
<p>Thus He meant to set forth the most decisive sign of its greatness. <q>Even so then shall it be with respect to the gospel too,</q> says He. Yea, for His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> were weakest of all, and least of all; but nevertheless, because of the great power that was in them, It has been unfolded in every part of the world.</p>
<p>After this He adds the leaven to this similitude, saying,</p>
<p><q>The Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is like leaven, which a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</q> </p>
<p>For as this converts the large quantity of meal into its own quality, even so shall you convert the whole world.</p>
<p>And see His wisdom, in that He brings in things natural, implying that as the one cannot fail to take place, so neither the other. For say not this to me: <q>What shall we be able to do, twelve men, throwing ourselves upon so vast a multitude?</q> Nay, for this very thing most of all makes your might conspicuous, that you mix with the multitude and are not put to flight. As therefore the leaven then leavens the lump when it comes close to the meal, and not simply close, but so as to be actually mixed with it (for He said not, <q>put,</q> simply, but <q>hid</q>); so also ye, when you cleave to your enemies, and are made one with them, then shall you get the better of them. And as the leaven, though it be buried, yet is not destroyed, but little by little transmutes all into its own condition; of like sort will the event be here also, with respect to the gospel. Fear ye not then, because I said there would be much injurious dealing: for even so shall you shine forth, and get the better of all.</p>
<p>But by <q>three measures,</q> here, He meant many, for He is wont to take this number for a multitude.</p>
<p>And marvel not, if discoursing about the kingdom, He made mention of a little seed and of leaven; for He was discoursing with men inexperienced and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, and such as needed to be led on by those means. For so simple were they, that even after all this, they required a good deal of explanation.</p>
<p>Where now are the children of the Greeks? Let them learn Christ's power, seeing the verity of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, and on either ground let them adore Him, that He both foretold so great a thing, and fulfilled it. Yea, for it is He that put the power into the leaven. With this intent He mingled also with the multitude those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him, that we might impart unto the rest of our wisdom. Let no one therefore reprove us for being few. For great is the power of the gospel, and that which has been once leavened, becomes leaven again for what remains. And as a spark, when it has caught in timber, makes what has been burnt up already increase the flame, and so proceeds to the rest; even so the gospel likewise. But He said not fire, but <q>leaven.</q> Why might this be? Because in that case the whole effect is not of the fire, but partly of the timber too that is kindled, but in this the leaven does the whole work by itself.</p>
<p>3. Now if twelve men leavened the whole world, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> how great our baseness, in that when we being so many are not able to amend them that remain; we, who ought to be enough for ten thousand worlds, and to become leaven to them. <q>But they,</q> one may say, <q>were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>.</q> And what then? Were they not partakers with you? Were they not brought up in cities? Did they not enjoy the same benefits? Did they not practise trades? What, were they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>? What, came they down from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>?</p>
<p><q>But they had signs,</q> it will be said. It was not the signs that made them admirable. How long shall we use those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> as cloaks for our own remissness? <em>Behold the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of the Saints, that they shone not by those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a></em>. Why, many who had actually cast out devils, because they wrought iniquity, instead of being admired, did even incur punishment.</p>
<p>And what can it be then, he will say, that showed them great? Their contempt of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, their despising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, their freedom from worldly things. Since surely, had they wanted these qualities, and been slaves of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, though they had raised ten thousand dead, so far from doing any good, they would even have been accounted deceivers. Thus it is their life, so bright on all sides, which also draws down the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> did John work, that he fixed on himself the attention of so many cities? For as to the fact that he did no wondrous works, hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a>, saying, <q>John did no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>.</q> And whence did Elias become admirable? Was it not from his boldness towards the king? From his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> towards God? From his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15506a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">voluntary</font></u></a> poverty? From his garment of sheep's skin, and his cave, and his mountains? For his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> he did after all these. And as to Job, what manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> did he work in sight of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, that he was amazed at him? No <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> indeed, but a life that shone and displayed an endurance firmer than any adamant. What manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> did David, yet being young, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> should say, <q>I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:22</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, what dead body did they raise? What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> did they cleanse? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, except we be sober, do even harm in many cases? Thus many of the Corinthians were severed one from another; thus many of the Romans were carried away with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>; thus was Simon cast out. Thus he, who at a certain time had a desire to follow Christ, was rejected, when he had been told, <q>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat008.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 8:20</font></u></a></span> For each of these, one aiming at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, another at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> bring, fell away and perished. But care of practice, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, so far from generating such a desire, does even take it away when it exists.</p>
<p>And Himself too, when He was making <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> for His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, what said He? <q>Do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, that men may see you</q>? By no means. But what? <q>Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:16</font></u></a></span> And to Peter again He said not, <q>If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> me,</q> <q>do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>,</q> but <q>feed my sheep.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh021.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 21:16</font></u></a></span> And whereas He everywhere distinguishes him with James and John above all the rest, for what, I pray you, did He distinguish them? For their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>? Nay, all alike cleansed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lepers</font></u></a>, and raised the dead; and to all alike He gave that authority.</p>
<p>Whence then had these the advantage? From the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Do you see how everywhere practice is required, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> by works? <q>For by their fruits,</q> says He, <q>you shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:16</font></u></a></span> And what commends our own life? Is it indeed a display of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, or the perfection of an excellent conversation? Very evidently it is the second; but as to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, they both have their origin from hence, and terminate herein. For both he that shows forth an excellent life, draws to himself this gift, and he that receives the gift, receives it for this end, that he may amend other men's lives. Since even Christ for this end wrought those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, that having made Himself thereby credible, and drawn men unto Him, He might bring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> into our life. Wherefore also He lays more stress of the two on this. For He is not at all satisfied with the signs only, but He also threatens <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and promises a kingdom, and lays down those startling <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, and all things He orders to this end, that He may make us equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And why say I, that Christ does all for this object? Why, even thou, should one give you your choice, to raise dead men by His name, or to die for His name; which I pray you, of the two would you rather accept? Is it not quite plain, the latter? And yet the one is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, the other but a work. And what, if one offered you to make grass gold, or to be able to despise all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> as grass, would you not rather accept this latter? And very reasonably. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> would be attracted by this more than any way. For if they saw the grass changed into gold, they would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covet</font></u></a> themselves also to acquire that power, as Simon did, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a> would be increased in them; but if they saw us all contemning and neglecting gold, as though it were grass, they would long ago have been delivered from this disease.</p>
<p>4. Do you see that our practice has more power to do good? By practice I mean, not your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>, nor yet your strewing sackcloth and ashes under you, but if you despise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, as it ought to be despised; if you be kindly affectioned, if you give your bread to the hungry, if you control <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, if you cast out vainglory, if you put away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. So He Himself used to teach: for, <q>Learn of me,</q> says He, <q>for I am meek and lowly in heart.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 11:29</font></u></a></span> He did not say, <q>for I fasted,</q> although surely He might have spoken of the forty days, yet He says not this; but, <q>I am meek and lowly in heart.</q> And again, when sending them out, He said not, <q>Fast,</q> but, <q>Eat of all that is set before you.</q> With regard to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, however, He required of them great strictness, saying, <q>Provide not gold, or silver, or brass, in your purses.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:9</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And all this I say, not to depreciate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>, God forbid, but rather highly to commend it. But I grieve when other duties being neglected, you think it enough for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, having but the last place in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For the greatest thing is charity, and moderation, and almsgiving; which hits a higher mark even than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virginity</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if you desire to become equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, there is nothing to hinder you. For to have arrived at this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> only suffices for your not at all falling short of them. Let no one therefore wait for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. For though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spirit is grieved, when he is driven out of a body, yet much more so, when he sees a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> delivered from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. For indeed this is his great power. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act008.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 8:10</font></u></a></span> This power caused Christ to die, that He might put an end to it. Yea, for this brought in death; by reason of this all things have been turned upside down. If then thou remove this, you have cut out the nerves of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, you have <q>bruised his head,</q> you have put an end to all his might, you have scattered his host, you have exhibited a sign greater than all signs.</p>
<p>The saying is not mine, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul's</font></u></a>. For when he had said, <q>Covet earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I unto you a more excellent way;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co012.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 12:31</font></u></a></span> he did not speak next of a sign, but of charity, the root of all our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things. If then we practise this, and all the self-denial that flows from it, we shall have no need of signs; even as on the other hand, if we do not practise it, we shall gain nothing by the signs.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind then all this, let us imitate those things whereby the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> became great. And whereby did they become great? Hear Peter, saying, <q>Behold we have forsaken all, and followed You; what shall we have therefore?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat019.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 19:27</font></u></a></span> Hear also Christ saying to them, <q>You shall sit upon twelve thrones,</q> and, <q>every one that has forsaken houses, or brethren, or father, or mother, shall receive an hundredfold in this world, and shall inherit everlasting life.</q> From all worldly things, therefore, let us withdraw ourselves, and dedicate ourselves to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, that we may both be made equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> according to His declaration, and may enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a> to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><strong>Matthew 13:34-35.</strong></p>
<p><q><em>All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitudes in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, and without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> spoke He not</em> <em>unto them; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, saying, I will open my mouth in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>; I will utter things that have been kept secret</em> <em>from the foundation of the world.</em></q> </p>

<p>Then pointing out that He is not making a new thing, He brings in the Prophet also, proclaiming beforehand this His manner of teaching. And to teach us the purpose of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, how He discoursed in this manner, not that they might be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, but that He might lead them to inquiry, he added, <q>And without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> spoke He nothing unto them.</q> Yet surely He did say many things without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>; but then nothing. And for all this no man asked Him questions, whereas the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200147.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Prophets</font></u></a>, we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, they were often questioning: as Ezekiel, for instance; as many others: but these did no such thing. Yet surely His sayings were enough to cast them into perplexity, and to stir them up to the inquiry; for indeed a very sore punishment was threatened by those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>: however, not even so were they moved.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He left them and went away. For,</p>
<p><q>Then,</q> says he, <q>Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into His house.</q> </p>
<p>And not one of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scribes</font></u></a> follows Him; whence it is clear that for no other purpose did they follow, than to take hold of Him. But when they marked not His sayings, thenceforth He let them be.</p>
<p><q>And His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> come unto Him, asking Him concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the tares;</q> although at times wishing to learn, and afraid <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar009.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 9:32</font></u></a></span> to ask. Whence then arose their confidence in this instance? They had been told, <q>To you it is given to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> of the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>;</q> and they were emboldened. Wherefore also they ask in private; not as grudging the multitude, but observing their Master's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200147.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">law</font></u></a>. For, <q>To these,</q> says He, <q>it is not given.</q></p>
<p>And why may it be that they let pass the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the leaven, and of the mustard seed, and inquire concerning this? They let those pass, as being plainer; but about this, as having an affinity to that before spoken, and as setting forth something more than it, they are desirous to learn (since He would not have spoken the same to them a second time); for indeed they saw how severe was the threatening therein uttered. Wherefore neither does He blame them, but rather completes His previous statements.</p>
<p>And, as I am always saying, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a> must not be explained throughout word for word, since many absurdities will follow; this even He Himself is teaching us here in thus interpreting this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. Thus He says not at all who the servants are that came to Him, but, implying that He brought them in, for the sake of some order, and to make up the picture, He omits that part, and interprets those that are most urgent and essential, and for the sake of which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> was spoken; signifying Himself to be Judge and Lord of all.</p>
<p><q>And He answered,</q> so it is said, <q>and said unto them, He that sows the good seed is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a>; the field is the world, the good seed, these are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> one; the enemy that sows them is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>; and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> shall send His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200147.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">furnace</font></u></a> of fire, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</q> </p>
<p>For whereas He Himself is the sower, and that of His own field, and out of His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200147.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom</font></u></a> He gathers, it is quite clear that the present world also is His.</p>
<p>But mark His unspeakable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and His leaning to bounty, and His disinclination to punishment; in that, when He sows, He sows in His own person, but when He punishes, it is by others, that is, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</q> Not because it will be just so much only, but because this star is surpassed in brightness by none that we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. He uses the comparisons that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to us.</p>
<p>And yet surely elsewhere He says, the harvest is already come; as when He says of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaritans</font></u></a>, <q>Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh004.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 4:35</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>The harvest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> is plenteous, but the laborers are few.</q> How then says He there, that the harvest is already come, while here He said, it is yet to be? According to another signification.</p>
<p>And how having elsewhere said, <q>One sows, and another reaps,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh004.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 4:37</font></u></a></span> does He here say, it is Himself that sows? Because there again, He was speaking, to distinguish the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, not from Himself, but from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and that in the case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaritans</font></u></a>. Since certainly it was He who sowed through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> also.</p>
<p>And at times He calls this self-same thing both harvest and sowing, naming it with relation, now to one thing, now to another. Thus when He is speaking of the conviction and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> of His converts, He calls the thing <q>a harvest,</q> as though He had accomplished all; but when He is seeking after the fruit of their hearing, He calls it seed, and the end, harvest.</p>
<p>And how says He elsewhere, that <q>the righteous are caught up first?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th004.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 4:17</font></u></a></span> Because they are indeed caught up first, but Christ having come, those others are given over to punishment, and then the former depart into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>. For because they must be in heaven, but He Himself is to come and judge all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> here; having passed sentence upon these, like some king He rises with His friends, leading them to that blessed portion. Do you see that the punishment is twofold, first to be burnt up, and then to fall from that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>2. But wherefore does He still go on, when the others have withdrawn, to speak to these also in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>? They had become wiser by His sayings, so as even to understand. At any rate, to them He says afterwards,</p>
<p><q>Have ye understood all these things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.</q> So completely, together with its other objects, did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> effect this too, that it made them more clear sighted. What then says He again?</p>
<p><q>The Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is like treasure hid in a field, the which when a man has found, he hides, and for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> thereof sells all that he has, and buys that field. Again, the Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is like a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</q> </p>
<p>Much as in the other place, the mustard seed and the leaven have but some little difference from each other, so here also these two <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, that of the treasure and that of the pearl. This being of course signified by both, that we ought to value the gospel above all things. And the former indeed, of the leaven and of the mustard seed, was spoken with a view to the power of the gospel, and to its surely prevailing over the world; but these declare its value, and great price. For as it extends itself like mustard seed, and prevails like leaven, so it is precious like a pearl, and affords full abundance like a treasure. We are then to learn not this only, that we ought to strip ourselves of everything else, and cling to the gospel, but also that we are to do so with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>; and when a man is dispossessing himself of his goods, he is to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the transaction is gain, and not loss.</p>
<p>Do you see how both the gospel is hid in the world, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things in the gospel?</p>
<p>Except thou sell all, you buy not; except thou have such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, anxious and inquiring, you find not. Two things therefore are requisite, abstinence from worldly matters, and watchfulness. For He says <q>One seeking goodly pearls, who when he had found one of great price, sold all and bought it.</q> For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is one, and not in many divisions.</p>
<p>And much as he that has the pearl <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> indeed himself that he is rich, but others <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not, many times, that he is holding it in his hand (for there is no corporeal bulk); just so also with the gospel, they that have hold of it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that they are rich, but the unbelievers, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> of this treasure, are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> also of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>3. After this, that we may not be confident in the gospel merely preached, nor think that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> only suffices us for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, He utters also another, an awful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. Which then is this? That of the net.</p>
<p><q>For the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind; which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</q> </p>
<p>And wherein does this differ from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the tares? For there too the one are saved, the other perish; but there, for choosing of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> doctrines; and those before this again, for not giving heed to His sayings, but these for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> of life; who are the most wretched of all, having attained to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, and being caught, but not even so capable of being saved.</p>
<p>Yet surely He says elsewhere, that the shepherd Himself separates them, but here He says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> do this; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:32</font></u></a></span> and so with respect to the tares. How then is it? At one time He discourses to them in a way more suited to their dullness, at another time in a higher strain.</p>
<p>And this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> He interprets without so much as being asked, but of His own motion He explained it by one part of it, and increased their awe. For lest, on being told, <q>They cast the bad away,</q> you should suppose that ruin to be without danger; by His interpretation He signified the punishment, saying, <q>They will cast them into the furnace.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse50" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:50</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And He declared the gnashing of teeth, and the anguish, that it is unspeakable.</p>
<p>Do you see how many are the ways of destruction? By the rock, by the thorns, by the wayside, by the tares, by the net. Not without reason therefore did He say, <q>Broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go away by it.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:13</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>4. Having then uttered all this, and concluded His discourse in a tone to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and signified that these are the majority of cases (for He dwelt more on them). He says,</p>
<p><q>Have ye understood all these things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.</q> </p>
<p>Then because they understood, He again praises them, saying,</p>
<p><q>Therefore every Scribe, which is instructed in the Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, is like a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse52" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:52</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Wherefore elsewhere also He says, <q>I will send you wise men and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:34</font></u></a></span> Do you see how so far from excluding the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>, He even commends it, and speaks publicly in favor of it, calling it <q>a treasure</q>?</p>
<p>So that as many as are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">divine Scriptures</font></u></a> cannot be <q>householders;</q> such as neither have of themselves, nor receive of others, but neglect their own case, perishing with famine. And not these only, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a> too, are excluded from this blessing. For they bring not forth things new and old. For they have not the old things, wherefore neither have they the new; even as they who have not the new, neither have they the old, but are deprived of both. For these are bound up and interwoven one with another.</p>
<p>Let us then hear, as many of us as neglect the reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, to what harm we are subjecting ourselves, to what poverty. For when are we to apply ourselves to the real practice of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, who do not so much as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> according to which our practice should be guided? But while the rich, those who are mad about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, are constantly shaking out their garments, that they may not become moth-eaten; do you, seeing forgetfulness worse than any moth wasting your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, neglect conversing with books? Do you not thrust away from you the pest, adorn your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, look continually upon the image of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and acquaint yourself with her members and her head? For she too has a head and members more seemly than any graceful and beautiful body.</p>
<p>What then, says one, is the head of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>? Humility. Wherefore Christ also begins with it, saying, <q>Blessed are the poor.</q> This head has not locks and ringlets, but beauty, such as to gain God's favor. For, <q>Unto whom shall I look,</q> says He, <q>but unto him that is meek and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>, and trembles at my words?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa066.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 66:2</font></u></a></span> And, <q>My eyes are upon the meek of the earth.</q> And, <q>The Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart.</q> This head, instead of locks, and flowing hair, bears <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> acceptable to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. It is a golden altar, and a spiritual place of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>; <q>For a contrite spirit is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> This is the mother of wisdom. If a man have this, he will have the rest also.</p>
<p>Have you seen a head such as you had never seen? Will you see the face too, or rather mark it? Mark then for the present its color, how ruddy, and blooming, and very engaging; and observe what are its ingredients. <q>Well, and what are they?</q> Shame-facedness and blushing. Wherefore also some one says, <q>Before a shamefaced man shall go favor.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir032.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 32:10</font></u></a></span> This sheds much beauty over the other members also. Though thou mix ten thousand colors, you will not produce such a bloom.</p>
<p>And if you will see the eyes also, behold them exactly delineated with decency and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14481a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temperance</font></u></a>. Wherefore they become also so beautiful and sharpsighted, as to behold even the Lord Himself. For, <q>Blessed,</q> says He, <q>are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:8</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And her mouth is wisdom and understanding, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hymns</font></u></a>. And her heart, acquaintance with Scripture, and maintenance of sound doctrines, and benevolence, and kindness. And as without this last there is no living, so without that other is never any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. Yea, for from that all her excellencies have birth. She has also for feet and hands the manifestations of her good works. She has a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> too, godliness. She has likewise a bosom of gold, and firmer than adamant, even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>; and all may be taken captive more easily than that bosom may be riven asunder. And the spirit that is in the brain and heart, is charity. </p>
<p>5. Will you that in her actual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> also I show you her image? Consider, I pray you, this very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a>: although we have not his whole life in writing, nevertheless even from a few facts one may see his image shine forth.</p>
<p>First, as to his having been lowly and contrite, hear him, after his gospel, calling himself a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>; for his being also merciful, see him stripping himself of all and following Jesus; and as to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>, it is evident from his doctrines. And his wisdom again it is easy to see from the gospel which he composed, and his charity (for he cared for the whole world); and the manifestation of his good works, from the throne on which he is to sit; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk022.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 22:30</font></u></a></span> and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> too, <q>by his departing with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> from the presence of the council.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:41</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Let us imitate then this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and most of all his humility and almsgiving, without which one cannot be saved. And this is shown by the five <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, and together with them by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisee</font></u></a>. For without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virginity</font></u></a> indeed it is possible to see the kingdom, but without almsgiving it cannot be. For this is among the things that are essential, and hold all together. Not unnaturally then have we called it the heart of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. But this heart, unless it supply breath to all, is soon extinguished. In the same way then as the fountain also, if it confine its streams to itself, grows putrid; so it is with the rich also, when they keep their possessions to themselves. Wherefore even in our common conversation we say, <q>great is the consumption of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> with such a man;</q> instead of saying, <q>great is the abundance, great the treasure.</q> For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> there is a consumption, not of the possessors only, but of the riches themselves. Since both garments laid by spoil, and gold is cankered, and grain is eaten up, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> too of their owner is more than they all cankered and corrupted by the cares of them.</p>
<p>And if you be willing to produce in the midst a miser's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; like a garment eaten by innumerable worms, and not having any sound part, even so will you find it, perforated on all sides by cares; rotted, cankered by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But not such the poor man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of him, I mean, that is voluntarily poor; but it is resplendent as gold, it shines like a pearl, and it blooms like a rose. For no moth is there, no thief is there, no worldly care, but as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> converse, so do they.</p>
<p>Would you see the beauty of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? Would you acquaint yourself with the riches of poverty? He commands not men, but he commands <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a>. He stands not at a king's side, but he has taken his stand near to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He is the comrade, not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>. He has not chests, two, or three, or twenty, but such an abundance as to account the whole world as nothing. He has not a treasure, but heaven. He needs not slaves, or rather has his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> for slaves, has for slaves the motives that rule over kings. For that which commands him who wears the purple, that motive shrinks before him. And royalty, and gold, and all such things, he laughs at, as at children's toys; and like hoops, and dice, and heads, and balls, so does he count all these to be contemptible. For he has an adorning, which they who play with these things cannot even see.</p>
<p>What then can be superior to this poor man? He has at least heaven for his pavement; but if the pavement be like this, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> the roof! But has he not horses and chariots? Why, what need has he of these, who is to be borne upon the clouds, and to be with Christ?</p>
<p>Having these things then impressed on our minds, let us, both men and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, seek after that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and the plenty that cannot be rifled; that we may attain also unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p>But having come there, while He slackens somewhat in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>; so as not to inflame them unto more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, nor to condemn them more grievously, by the aggravation of their unbelief: He yet puts forth a doctrine, having no less of wonder in it than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. For these utterly senseless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200148.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, when they ought to have marvelled, and to have been amazed at the power of His words, they on the contrary hold Him cheap, because of him who seemed to be His father; yet we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> they had many examples of these things in the former times, and from fathers of no note had seen illustrious children. For so David was the son of a certain mean husbandman, Jesse; and Amos, the child of a goatherd, and himself a goatherd; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/amo007.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amos 7:14-15</font></u></a></span> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> too, the lawgiver, had a father very inferior to himself. When they therefore, for this especially, ought to adore and be amazed, that being of such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> He spoke such things, it being quite manifest, that so it was not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> care, but of God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>: yet they, what things they should admire Him for, for those they despise Him.</p>
<p>He is moreover continually frequenting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a>, lest if He were always abiding in the wilderness, they should the more accuse Him as making a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a>, and fighting against their polity.

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse55" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:55</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>The greater then the marvel, and the more abundant the ground of amaze. <q>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us? Whence has this man these things? And they were offended in Him.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse55" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:55-56</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a> was where He was discoursing? <q>Are not his brethren,</q> it is said, <q>such a one, and such a one?</q> And what of this? Why, by this especially you ought to have been led on to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> you see is a poor base thing, and often falls foul of itself. For what things were strange and marvellous, and enough to have gained them over, these offended them.</p>
<p>What then says Christ unto them? <q>A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>is not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, save in his own country, and in his own house: and He did not,</q> it is said, <q>many mighty works, because of their unbelief.</q> But Luke says, <q>And He did not there many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>.</q> And yet it was to be expected He should have done them. For if the feeling of wonder towards Him was gaining ground (for indeed even there He was marvelled at), wherefore did He not do them? Because He looked not to the display of Himself, but to their profit. Therefore when this succeeded not, He overlooked what concerned Himself, in order not to aggravate their punishment.</p>
<p>And yet see after how long a time He came to them, and after how great a display of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: but not even so did they endure it, but were inflamed again with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He yet do a few <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>? That they might not say, <q>Physician, heal yourself.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk004.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 4:23</font></u></a></span> That they might not say, <q>He is a foe and an enemy to us, and overlooks His own;</q> that they might not say, <q>If <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> had been wrought, we also should have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> Therefore He both wrought them, and stayed: the one, that He might fulfill His own part; the other, that He might not condemn them the more.</p>
<p>And consider thou the power of His words, herein at least, that possessed as they were by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, they did yet admire. And as with regard to His works, they do not find fault with what is done, but feign causes which have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a>, slaying, <q>In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a> He casts out the devils;</q> even so here too, they find no fault with the teaching, but take refuge in the meanness of His race.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, the Master's gentleness, how He reviles them not, but with great mildness says, <q>A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> is not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, save in his own country.</q> And neither here did He stop, but added, <q>And in his own house.</q> To me it appears, that with covert reference to His very own brethren, He made this addition.</p>
<p>But in Luke He puts examples also of this, saying, that neither did Elias come unto His own, but to the stranger <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow</font></u></a>; neither by Eliseus was any other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> healed, but the stranger Naaman; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk004.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 4:25-27</font></u></a></span> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a> neither received benefit, nor conferred benefit, but the foreigners. And these things He says, signifying in every instance their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> disposition, and that in His case nothing new is taking place.</p>
<p>2. <q>At that time <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus.</q> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> the king, this man's father, he that slew the children, was dead.</p>
<p>But not without a purpose does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> signify the time, but to make you observe also the haughtiness of the tyrant, and his thoughtlessness, in that not at the beginning did he inform himself about Christ, but after a very long time. For such are they that are in places of power, and are encompassed with much pomp, they learn these things late, because they do not make much account of them.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, how great a thing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is, that he was afraid of him even when dead, and out of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> he speaks wisely even concerning a resurrection.</p>
<p><q>For he said,</q> it is mentioned, <q>unto his servants, This is John, whom I slew, he is risen from the dead, and therefore the mighty powers do work in him.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:2</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see the intensity of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? For neither then did he dare to publish it abroad, but he still speaks but to his own servants.</p>
<p>But yet even this opinion savored of the soldier, and was absurd. For many besides had risen from the dead, and no one had wrought anything of the kind. And his words seem to me to be the language both of vanity, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of unreasonable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, they admit often a mixture of opposite <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But Luke affirms that the multitudes said, <q>This is Elias, or Jeremias, or one of the old <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>,</q> but he, as uttering forsooth something wiser than the rest, made this assertion.</p>
<p>But it is probable that before this, in answer to them that said He was John (for many had said this too), he had denied it, and said, <q>I slew him,</q> priding himself and glorying in it. For this both Mark and Luke report that he said, <q>John I beheaded.</q> But when the rumor prevailed, then he too says the same as the people.</p>
<p>Then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> relates to us also the history. And what might his reason be for not introducing it as a subject by itself? Because all their labor entirely was to tell what related to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and they made themselves no secondary work besides this, except it were again to contribute to the same end. Therefore neither now would they have mentioned the history were it not on Christ's account, and because <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> said, <q>John is risen again.</q></p>
<p>But Mark says, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> exceedingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> the man, and this, when reproved. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:20</font></u></a></span> So great a thing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Then his narrative proceeds thus: <q>For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias'</font></u></a> sake, his brother Philip's wife. For John said unto him, It is not lawful for you to have her. And when he would have put him to death, he feared the people, because they counted him as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:3-5</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And wherefore does he not address his discourse at all to her, but to the man? Because it depended more on him.</p>
<p>But see how inoffensive he makes his accusation, as relating a history rather than bringing a charge.</p>
<p>4. <q>But when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod's</font></u></a> birth-day was kept,</q> says he, <q>the daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a> danced before them, and pleased <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:6</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>O diabolical revel! O satanic spectacle! O lawless dancing! And more lawless reward for the dancing. For a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> more impious than all murders was perpetrated, and he that was worthy to be crowned and publicly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, was slain in the midst, and the trophy of the devils was set on the table.</p>
<p>And the means too of the victory were worthy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> done. For,</p>
<p><q>The daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a>,</q> it is said, <q>danced in the midst, and pleased <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a>. Whereupon he swore with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> to give her whatsoever she would ask. And she being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:6-8</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Her reproach is twofold; first, that she danced, then that she pleased him, and so pleased him, as to obtain even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> for her reward.</p>
<p>Do you see how savage he was? How senseless? How foolish? In putting himself under the obligation of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, while to her he gives full power over her request. But when he saw the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> actually ensuing, <q>he was sorry,</q> it is said; and yet in the first instance he had put him in bonds. Wherefore then is he sorry? Such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, even among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> admiration and praises are its due. But alas for her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>! When she too ought to admire, yea, to bow down to him, for trying to redress her wrong, she on the contrary even helps to arrange the plot, and lays a snare, and asks a diabolical favor.</p>
<p>But he was afraid <q>for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath's</font></u></a> sake,</q> it is said, <q>and them that sat at meat with him.</q> And how did you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> that which is more grievous? Surely if you were afraid to have witnesses of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>, much more ought thou to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> having so many witnesses of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> so lawless.</p>
<p>But as I think many are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the grievance itself, whence the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> had its origin, I must declare this too, that you may learn the wisdom of the lawgiver. What then was the ancient law, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> indeed trampled on, but John vindicated? The wife of him that died childless was to be given to his brother. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu025.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 25:5</font></u></a></span> For since death was an incurable ill, and all was contrived for life's sake; He makes a law that the living brother should marry her, and should call the child that is born by the name of the dead, so that his house should not utterly perish. For if the dead were not so much as to leave children, which is the greatest mitigation of death, the sorrow would be without remedy. Therefore you see, the lawgiver devised this refreshment for those who were by nature deprived of children, and commanded the issue to be reckoned as belonging to the other.</p>
<p>But when there was a child, this marriage was no longer permitted. <q>And wherefore?</q> one may say, <q>for if it was lawful for another, much more for the brother.</q> By no means. For He will have men's consanguinity extended, and the sources multiplied of our interest in each other.</p>
<p>Why then, in the case also of death without offspring, did not another marry her? Because it would not so be accounted the child of the departed; but now his brother begetting it, the fiction became probable. And besides, any other man had no constraining call to build up the house of the dead, but this had incurred the claim by relationship.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> had married his brother's wife, when she had a child, therefore John blames him, and blames him with moderation, showing together with his boldness, his consideration also.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, how the whole theatre was devilish. For first, it was made up of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a> and luxury, whence nothing healthful could come. Secondly, the spectators in it were depraved, and he that gave the banquet the worst transgressor of all. Thirdly, there was the irrational pleasure. Fourthly, the damsel, because of whom the marriage was illegal, who ought even to have hid herself, as though her mother were dishonored by her, comes making a show, and throwing into the shade all harlots, virgin as she was.</p>
<p>And the time again contributes no little to the reproof of this enormity. For when he ought to be thanking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that on that day He had brought him to light, then he ventures upon those lawless acts. When one in chains ought to have been freed by him, then he adds slaughter to bonds.</p>
<p>Hearken, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, or rather ye wives also, as many as consent to such unseemliness at other person's weddings, leaping, and bounding, and disgracing our common nature. Hearken, you men too, as many as follow after those banquets, full of expense and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> ye the gulf of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one. For indeed so mightily did he seize upon that wretched person just then, that he swore even to give the half of his kingdom: this being Mark's statement, <q>He swore unto her, Whatsoever you shall ask of me, I will give it you, unto the half of my kingdom.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:23</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Such was the value he set upon his royal power; so was he once for all made captive by his passion, as to give up <em>his kingdom</em> for a dance. vilifying, reviling, insulting. But not so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>; they on the contrary mourn for such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, rather than curse them.</p>
<p>8. This then let us also do, and let us weep for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a>, and for them that imitate her. For many such revels now also take place, and though John be not slain, yet the members of Christ are, and in a far more grievous way. For it is not a head in a charger that the dancers of our time ask, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of them that sit at the feast. For in making them slaves, and leading them to unlawful loves, and besetting them with harlots, they do not take off the head, but slay the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, making them adulterers, and effeminate, and whoremongers.</p>
<p>For you will not surely tell me, that when full of wine, and drunken, and looking at a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> who is dancing and uttering base words, thou dost not feel anything towards her, neither art hurried on to profligacy, overcome by your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. Nay, that awful thing befalls you, that you <q>makest the members of Christ members of an harlot.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:15</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>For though the daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a> be not present, yet the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, who then danced in her person, in theirs also holds his choirs now, and departs with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of those guests taken captive.</p>
<p>But if you are able to keep clear of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, yet are you partakers of another most grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; such revels being also full of much rapine. For look not, I pray you, on the meats that are set before them, nor on the cakes; but consider whence they are gathered, and you will see that it is of vexation, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, and rapine.</p>
<p><q>Nay, ours are not from such sources,</q> one may say. God forbid they should be: for neither do I desire it. Nevertheless, although they be clear of these, not even so are our costly feasts freed from blame. Hear, at all events, how even apart from these things the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> finds fault with them, thus speaking, <q>Woe to them that drink wine racked off, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments.</q> Do you see how He censures luxury too? For it is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> which He here lays to their charge, but prodigality only.</p>
<p>And you eat to excess, Christ not even for need; thou various cakes, He not so much as dry bread; you drink Thasian wine, but on Him you have not bestowed so much as a cup of cold water in His thirst. You are on a soft and embroidered bed, but He is perishing with the cold.</p>
<p>Wherefore, though the banquets be clear from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, yet even so are they accursed, because, while for your part you do all in excess, to Him you give not even His need; and that, living in luxury upon things that belong to Him. Why, if you were guardian to a child, and having taken possession of his goods, were to neglect him in extremities, you would have ten thousand accusers, and wouldest suffer the punishment appointed by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>; and now having taken possession of the goods of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and thus consuming them for no purpose, do you not think you will have to give account?</p>
<p>9. And these things I say not of those who introduce harlots to their tables (for to them I have nothing to say, even as neither have I to the dogs), nor of those who cheat some, and pamper others (for neither with them have I anything to do, even as I have not with the swine and with the wolves); but of those who enjoy indeed their own property, but do not impart thereof to others; of those who spend their patrimony at random. For neither are these clear from reprehension. For how, tell me, will you escape reprov ing and blame, while your parasite is pampered, and the dog that stands by you, but Christ's worth appears to you even not equal to theirs? When the one receives so much for laughter's sake, but the other for the Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> not so much as the smallest fraction thereof. And while the parasite, on saying something witty, goes away filled; this Man, who has taught us, what if we had not learned we should have been no better than the dogs—is He counted unworthy of even the same treatment with such an one?</p>
<p>Do you shudder at being told it? Shudder then at the realities. Cast out the parasites, and make Christ to sit down to meat with you. If He partake of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13403b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salt</font></u></a>, and of your table, He will be mild in judging you: He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to respect a man's table. Yea, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this, much more the Lord. Think, for instance, of that harlot, how at a table He justified her, and upbraids Simon, saying, <q>You gave me no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kiss</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk007.htm#verse54" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 7:54</font></u></a></span> I say, if He feed you, not doing these things, much more will He reward you, doing them. Look not at the poor man, that he comes to you filthy and squalid, but consider that Christ by him is setting foot in your house, and cease from your fierceness, and your relentless words, with which you are even aspersing such as come to you, calling them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>, idle, and other names more grievous than these.</p>
<p>And think, when you are talking so, of the parasites; what kind of works do they accomplish? In what respect do they profit your house? Do they really make your dinner pleasant to you? Pleasant, by their being beaten and saying foul words? Nay, what can be more unpleasing than this, when you smite him that is made after God's likeness, and from your insolence to him gatherest enjoyment for yourself, making your house a theatre, and filling your banquet with stage-players, thou who art well born and free imitating the actors with their heads shaven? For among them too is laughter, and rude blows.</p>
<p>These things then do you call pleasure, I pray you, which are deserving of many tears, of much mourning and lamentation? And when it were fit to urge them to a good life, to give timely advice, do you lead them on to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjuries</font></u></a>, and disorderly language, and call the thing a delight? And that which procures <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, do you account a subject of pleasure? Yea, and when they are at a loss for witty sayings, they pay the whole reckoning with oaths and false swearing. Are these things then worthy of laughter, and not of lamentations and tears? Nay, who would say so, that has understanding?</p>
<p>And this I say, not forbidding them to be fed, but not for such a purpose. Nay, let their maintenance have the motive of kindness, not of cruelty; let it be compassion, not insolence. Because he is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, feed him; because Christ is fed, feed him; not for introducing satanical sayings, and disgracing his own life. Look not at him outwardly laughing, but examine his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, and then you will see him uttering ten thousand imprecations against himself, and groaning, and wailing. And if he do not show it, this also is due to you.</p>
<p>10. Let the companions of your meals then be men that are poor and free, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjured</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, nor stage-players. And if you must needs ask of them a requital for their food, enjoin them, should they see anything done that is amiss, to rebuke, to admonish, to help you in your care over your household, in the government of your servants. Have you children? Let these be joint fathers to them, let them divide your charge with you, let them yield you such profits as God loves. Engage them in a spiritual traffic. And if you see one needing protection, bid them succor, command them to minister. By these do thou track the strangers out, by these clothe the naked, by these send to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, put an end to the distresses of others.</p>
<p>Let them give you, for their food, this requital, which profits both you and them, and carries with it no condemnation.</p>
<p>Hereby friendship also is more closely riveted. For now, though they seem to be loved, yet for all that they are ashamed, as living without object in your house; but if they accomplish these purposes, both they will be more pleasantly situated, and you will have more satisfaction in maintaining them, as not spending your money without fruit; and they again will dwell with you in boldness and due freedom, and your house, instead of a theatre, will become to you a church, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> will be put to flight, and Christ will enter, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>. For where Christ is, there are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> too, and where Christ and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> are, there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, there is a light more cheerful than this of the sun.</p>
<p>And if you would reap yet another consolation through their means, command them, when you are at leisure, to take their books and read the divine law. They will have more pleasure in so ministering to you, than in the other way. For these things add respect both to you and to them, but those bring disgrace upon all together; upon you as an insolent person and a drunkard, upon them as wretched and gluttonous. For if you feed in order to insult them, it is worse than if you had put them to death; but if for their good and profit, it is more useful again than if you had brought them back from their way to execution. And now indeed thou dost disgrace them more than your servants, and your servants enjoy more liberty of speech, and freedom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, than they do; but then you will make them equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Set free therefore both them and your own self, and take away the name of parasite, and call them companions of your meals; cast away the appellation of flatterers, and bestow on them that of friends. With this intent indeed did God make our friendships, not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> to the beloved and loving, but for their good and profit.</p>
<p>But these friendships are more grievous than any enmity. For by our enemies, if we will, we are even profited; but by these we must needs be harmed, no question of it. Keep not then friends to teach you harm; keep not friends who are enamored rather of your table than of your friendship. For all such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, if you retrench your good living, retrench their friendship too; but they that associate with you for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue's</font></u></a> sake, remain continually, enduring every change.</p>
<p>And besides, the race of the parasites does often take revenge upon you, and bring upon you an ill fame. Hence at least I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> many respectable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to have got bad characters, and some have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> reported of for sorceries, some for adulteries and corrupting of youths. For whereas they have no work to do, but spend their own life unprofitably; their ministry is suspected by the multitude as being the same with that of corrupt youths.</p>
<p>Therefore, delivering ourselves both from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report, and above all from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> that is to come, and doing the things that are well-pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, let us put an end to this devilish custom, that <q>both eating and drinking we may do all things to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co010.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 10:31</font></u></a></span> and enjoy the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that comes from Him; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p>And what does he now call His country? As it seems to me, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a>. <q>For He did not many mighty works there,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse58" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:58</font></u></a></span> it is said, but in Capernaum He did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: wherefore He said also, <q>And thou, Capernaum, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200148.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">art exalted</font></u></a> unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, shall be brought down to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>; for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>, it would have remained until this day.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat011.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 11:23</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>But having come there, while He slackens somewhat in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>; so as not to inflame them unto more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, nor to condemn them more grievously, by the aggravation of their unbelief: He yet puts forth a doctrine, having no less of wonder in it than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. For these utterly senseless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200148.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, when they ought to have marvelled, and to have been amazed at the power of His words, they on the contrary hold Him cheap, because of him who seemed to be His father; yet we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> they had many examples of these things in the former times, and from fathers of no note had seen illustrious children. For so David was the son of a certain mean husbandman, Jesse; and Amos, the child of a goatherd, and himself a goatherd; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/amo007.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amos 7:14-15</font></u></a></span> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> too, the lawgiver, had a father very inferior to himself. When they therefore, for this especially, ought to adore and be amazed, that being of such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> He spoke such things, it being quite manifest, that so it was not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> care, but of God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>: yet they, what things they should admire Him for, for those they despise Him.</p>
<p>He is moreover continually frequenting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a>, lest if He were always abiding in the wilderness, they should the more accuse Him as making a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a>, and fighting against their polity. Being amazed therefore, and in perplexity, they said, <q>Whence has this man this wisdom, and these powers?</q> either calling the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> powers, or even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200148.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wisdom</font></u></a> itself. <q>Is not this the carpenter's son?</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse55" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:55</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>The greater then the marvel, and the more abundant the ground of amaze. <q>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us? Whence has this man these things? And they were offended in Him.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse55" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:55-56</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a> was where He was discoursing? <q>Are not his brethren,</q> it is said, <q>such a one, and such a one?</q> And what of this? Why, by this especially you ought to have been led on to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> you see is a poor base thing, and often falls foul of itself. For what things were strange and marvellous, and enough to have gained them over, these offended them.</p>
<p>What then says Christ unto them? <q>A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>is not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, save in his own country, and in his own house: and He did not,</q> it is said, <q>many mighty works, because of their unbelief.</q> But Luke says, <q>And He did not there many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>.</q> And yet it was to be expected He should have done them. For if the feeling of wonder towards Him was gaining ground (for indeed even there He was marvelled at), wherefore did He not do them? Because He looked not to the display of Himself, but to their profit. Therefore when this succeeded not, He overlooked what concerned Himself, in order not to aggravate their punishment.</p>
<p>And yet see after how long a time He came to them, and after how great a display of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: but not even so did they endure it, but were inflamed again with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He yet do a few <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>? That they might not say, <q>Physician, heal yourself.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk004.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 4:23</font></u></a></span> That they might not say, <q>He is a foe and an enemy to us, and overlooks His own;</q> that they might not say, <q>If <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> had been wrought, we also should have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> Therefore He both wrought them, and stayed: the one, that He might fulfill His own part; the other, that He might not condemn them the more.</p>
<p>And consider thou the power of His words, herein at least, that possessed as they were by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, they did yet admire. And as with regard to His works, they do not find fault with what is done, but feign causes which have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a>, slaying, <q>In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a> He casts out the devils;</q> even so here too, they find no fault with the teaching, but take refuge in the meanness of His race.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, the Master's gentleness, how He reviles them not, but with great mildness says, <q>A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> is not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, save in his own country.</q> And neither here did He stop, but added, <q>And in his own house.</q> To me it appears, that with covert reference to His very own brethren, He made this addition.</p>
<p>But in Luke He puts examples also of this, saying, that neither did Elias come unto His own, but to the stranger <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow</font></u></a>; neither by Eliseus was any other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> healed, but the stranger Naaman; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk004.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 4:25-27</font></u></a></span> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a> neither received benefit, nor conferred benefit, but the foreigners. And these things He says, signifying in every instance their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> disposition, and that in His case nothing new is taking place.</p>
<p>2. <q>At that time <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus.</q> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> the king, this man's father, he that slew the children, was dead.</p>
<p>But not without a purpose does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> signify the time, but to make you observe also the haughtiness of the tyrant, and his thoughtlessness, in that not at the beginning did he inform himself about Christ, but after a very long time. For such are they that are in places of power, and are encompassed with much pomp, they learn these things late, because they do not make much account of them.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, how great a thing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is, that he was afraid of him even when dead, and out of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> he speaks wisely even concerning a resurrection.</p>
<p><q>For he said,</q> it is mentioned, <q>unto his servants, This is John, whom I slew, he is risen from the dead, and therefore the mighty powers do work in him.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:2</font></u></a></span> Do you see the intensity of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? For neither then did he dare to publish it abroad, but he still speaks but to his own servants.</p>
<p>But yet even this opinion savored of the soldier, and was absurd. For many besides had risen from the dead, and no one had wrought anything of the kind. And his words seem to me to be the language both of vanity, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of unreasonable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, they admit often a mixture of opposite <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But Luke affirms that the multitudes said, <q>This is Elias, or Jeremias, or one of the old <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>,</q> but he, as uttering forsooth something wiser than the rest, made this assertion.</p>
<p>But it is probable that before this, in answer to them that said He was John (for many had said this too), he had denied it, and said, <q>I slew him,</q> priding himself and glorying in it. For this both Mark and Luke report that he said, <q>John I beheaded.</q> But when the rumor prevailed, then he too says the same as the people.</p>
<p>Then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> relates to us also the history. And what might his reason be for not introducing it as a subject by itself? Because all their labor entirely was to tell what related to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and they made themselves no secondary work besides this, except it were again to contribute to the same end. Therefore neither now would they have mentioned the history were it not on Christ's account, and because <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> said, <q>John is risen again.</q></p>
<p>But Mark says, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> exceedingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> the man, and this, when reproved. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:20</font></u></a></span> So great a thing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Then his narrative proceeds thus: <q>For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias'</font></u></a> sake, his brother Philip's wife. For John said unto him, It is not lawful for you to have her. And when he would have put him to death, he feared the people, because they counted him as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:3-5</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>And wherefore does he not address his discourse at all to her, but to the man? Because it depended more on him.</p>
<p>But see how inoffensive he makes his accusation, as relating a history rather than bringing a charge.</p>
<p>4. <q>But when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod's</font></u></a> birth-day was kept,</q> says he, <q>the daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a> danced before them, and pleased <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:6</font></u></a></span> O diabolical revel! O satanic spectacle! O lawless dancing! And more lawless reward for the dancing. For a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> more impious than all murders was perpetrated, and he that was worthy to be crowned and publicly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, was slain in the midst, and the trophy of the devils was set on the table.</p>
<p>And the means too of the victory were worthy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> done. For,</p>
<p><q>The daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a>,</q> it is said, <q>danced in the midst, and pleased <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a>. Whereupon he swore with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> to give her whatsoever she would ask. And she being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:6-8</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Her reproach is twofold; first, that she danced, then that she pleased him, and so pleased him, as to obtain even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> for her reward.</p>
<p>Do you see how savage he was? How senseless? How foolish? In putting himself under the obligation of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, while to her he gives full power over her request. But when he saw the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> actually ensuing, <q>he was sorry,</q> it is said; and yet in the first instance he had put him in bonds. Wherefore then is he sorry? Such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, even among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> admiration and praises are its due. But alas for her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>! When she too ought to admire, yea, to bow down to him, for trying to redress her wrong, she on the contrary even helps to arrange the plot, and lays a snare, and asks a diabolical favor.</p>
<p>But he was afraid <q>for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath's</font></u></a> sake,</q> it is said, <q>and them that sat at meat with him.</q> And how did you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> that which is more grievous? Surely if you were afraid to have witnesses of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>, much more ought thou to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> having so many witnesses of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> so lawless.</p>
<p>But as I think many are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the grievance itself, whence the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> had its origin, I must declare this too, that you may learn the wisdom of the lawgiver. What then was the ancient law, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> indeed trampled on, but John vindicated? The wife of him that died childless was to be given to his brother. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu025.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 25:5</font></u></a></span> For since death was an incurable ill, and all was contrived for life's sake; He makes a law that the living brother should marry her, and should call the child that is born by the name of the dead, so that his house should not utterly perish. For if the dead were not so much as to leave children, which is the greatest mitigation of death, the sorrow would be without remedy. Therefore you see, the lawgiver devised this refreshment for those who were by nature deprived of children, and commanded the issue to be reckoned as belonging to the other.</p>
<p>But when there was a child, this marriage was no longer permitted. <q>And wherefore?</q> one may say, <q>for if it was lawful for another, much more for the brother.</q> By no means. For He will have men's consanguinity extended, and the sources multiplied of our interest in each other.</p>
<p>Why then, in the case also of death without offspring, did not another marry her? Because it would not so be accounted the child of the departed; but now his brother begetting it, the fiction became probable. And besides, any other man had no constraining call to build up the house of the dead, but this had incurred the claim by relationship.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> had married his brother's wife, when she had a child, therefore John blames him, and blames him with moderation, showing together with his boldness, his consideration also.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray you, how the whole theatre was devilish. For first, it was made up of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a> and luxury, whence nothing healthful could come. Secondly, the spectators in it were depraved, and he that gave the banquet the worst transgressor of all. Thirdly, there was the irrational pleasure. Fourthly, the damsel, because of whom the marriage was illegal, who ought even to have hid herself, as though her mother were dishonored by her, comes making a show, and throwing into the shade all harlots, virgin as she was.</p>
<p>And the time again contributes no little to the reproof of this enormity. For when he ought to be thanking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that on that day He had brought him to light, then he ventures upon those lawless acts. When one in chains ought to have been freed by him, then he adds slaughter to bonds.</p>
<p>Hearken, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, or rather ye wives also, as many as consent to such unseemliness at other person's weddings, leaping, and bounding, and disgracing our common nature. Hearken, you men too, as many as follow after those banquets, full of expense and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> ye the gulf of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one. For indeed so mightily did he seize upon that wretched person just then, that he swore even to give the half of his kingdom: this being Mark's statement, <q>He swore unto her, Whatsoever you shall ask of me, I will give it you, unto the half of my kingdom.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:23</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Such was the value he set upon his royal power; so was he once for all made captive by his passion, as to give up <em>his kingdom</em> for a dance. vilifying, reviling, insulting. But not so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>; they on the contrary mourn for such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, rather than curse them.</p>
<p>8. This then let us also do, and let us weep for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a>, and for them that imitate her. For many such revels now also take place, and though John be not slain, yet the members of Christ are, and in a far more grievous way. For it is not a head in a charger that the dancers of our time ask, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of them that sit at the feast. For in making them slaves, and leading them to unlawful loves, and besetting them with harlots, they do not take off the head, but slay the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, making them adulterers, and effeminate, and whoremongers.</p>
<p>For you will not surely tell me, that when full of wine, and drunken, and looking at a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> who is dancing and uttering base words, thou dost not feel anything towards her, neither art hurried on to profligacy, overcome by your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. Nay, that awful thing befalls you, that you <q>makest the members of Christ members of an harlot.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:15</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>For though the daughter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07292a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herodias</font></u></a> be not present, yet the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, who then danced in her person, in theirs also holds his choirs now, and departs with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of those guests taken captive.</p>
<p>But if you are able to keep clear of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, yet are you partakers of another most grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; such revels being also full of much rapine. For look not, I pray you, on the meats that are set before them, nor on the cakes; but consider whence they are gathered, and you will see that it is of vexation, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, and rapine.</p>
<p><q>Nay, ours are not from such sources,</q> one may say. God forbid they should be: for neither do I desire it. Nevertheless, although they be clear of these, not even so are our costly feasts freed from blame. Hear, at all events, how even apart from these things the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> finds fault with them, thus speaking, <q>Woe to them that drink wine racked off, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments.</q> Do you see how He censures luxury too? For it is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> which He here lays to their charge, but prodigality only.</p>
<p>And you eat to excess, Christ not even for need; thou various cakes, He not so much as dry bread; you drink Thasian wine, but on Him you have not bestowed so much as a cup of cold water in His thirst. You are on a soft and embroidered bed, but He is perishing with the cold.</p>
<p>Wherefore, though the banquets be clear from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, yet even so are they accursed, because, while for your part you do all in excess, to Him you give not even His need; and that, living in luxury upon things that belong to Him. Why, if you were guardian to a child, and having taken possession of his goods, were to neglect him in extremities, you would have ten thousand accusers, and wouldest suffer the punishment appointed by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>; and now having taken possession of the goods of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and thus consuming them for no purpose, do you not think you will have to give account?</p>
<p>9. And these things I say not of those who introduce harlots to their tables (for to them I have nothing to say, even as neither have I to the dogs), nor of those who cheat some, and pamper others (for neither with them have I anything to do, even as I have not with the swine and with the wolves); but of those who enjoy indeed their own property, but do not impart thereof to others; of those who spend their patrimony at random. For neither are these clear from reprehension. For how, tell me, will you escape reprov ing and blame, while your parasite is pampered, and the dog that stands by you, but Christ's worth appears to you even not equal to theirs? When the one receives so much for laughter's sake, but the other for the Kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> not so much as the smallest fraction thereof. And while the parasite, on saying something witty, goes away filled; this Man, who has taught us, what if we had not learned we should have been no better than the dogs—is He counted unworthy of even the same treatment with such an one?</p>
<p>Do you shudder at being told it? Shudder then at the realities. Cast out the parasites, and make Christ to sit down to meat with you. If He partake of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13403b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salt</font></u></a>, and of your table, He will be mild in judging you: He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to respect a man's table. Yea, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this, much more the Lord. Think, for instance, of that harlot, how at a table He justified her, and upbraids Simon, saying, <q>You gave me no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kiss</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk007.htm#verse54" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 7:54</font></u></a></span> I say, if He feed you, not doing these things, much more will He reward you, doing them. Look not at the poor man, that he comes to you filthy and squalid, but consider that Christ by him is setting foot in your house, and cease from your fierceness, and your relentless words, with which you are even aspersing such as come to you, calling them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>, idle, and other names more grievous than these.</p>
<p>And think, when you are talking so, of the parasites; what kind of works do they accomplish? In what respect do they profit your house? Do they really make your dinner pleasant to you? Pleasant, by their being beaten and saying foul words? Nay, what can be more unpleasing than this, when you smite him that is made after God's likeness, and from your insolence to him gatherest enjoyment for yourself, making your house a theatre, and filling your banquet with stage-players, thou who art well born and free imitating the actors with their heads shaven? For among them too is laughter, and rude blows.</p>
<p>These things then do you call pleasure, I pray you, which are deserving of many tears, of much mourning and lamentation? And when it were fit to urge them to a good life, to give timely advice, do you lead them on to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjuries</font></u></a>, and disorderly language, and call the thing a delight? And that which procures <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, do you account a subject of pleasure? Yea, and when they are at a loss for witty sayings, they pay the whole reckoning with oaths and false swearing. Are these things then worthy of laughter, and not of lamentations and tears? Nay, who would say so, that has understanding?</p>
<p>And this I say, not forbidding them to be fed, but not for such a purpose. Nay, let their maintenance have the motive of kindness, not of cruelty; let it be compassion, not insolence. Because he is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, feed him; because Christ is fed, feed him; not for introducing satanical sayings, and disgracing his own life. Look not at him outwardly laughing, but examine his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, and then you will see him uttering ten thousand imprecations against himself, and groaning, and wailing. And if he do not show it, this also is due to you.</p>
<p>10. Let the companions of your meals then be men that are poor and free, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjured</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, nor stage-players. And if you must needs ask of them a requital for their food, enjoin them, should they see anything done that is amiss, to rebuke, to admonish, to help you in your care over your household, in the government of your servants. Have you children? Let these be joint fathers to them, let them divide your charge with you, let them yield you such profits as God loves. Engage them in a spiritual traffic. And if you see one needing protection, bid them succor, command them to minister. By these do thou track the strangers out, by these clothe the naked, by these send to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, put an end to the distresses of others.</p>
<p>Let them give you, for their food, this requital, which profits both you and them, and carries with it no condemnation.</p>
<p>Hereby friendship also is more closely riveted. For now, though they seem to be loved, yet for all that they are ashamed, as living without object in your house; but if they accomplish these purposes, both they will be more pleasantly situated, and you will have more satisfaction in maintaining them, as not spending your money without fruit; and they again will dwell with you in boldness and due freedom, and your house, instead of a theatre, will become to you a church, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> will be put to flight, and Christ will enter, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>. For where Christ is, there are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> too, and where Christ and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> are, there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, there is a light more cheerful than this of the sun.</p>
<p>And if you would reap yet another consolation through their means, command them, when you are at leisure, to take their books and read the divine law. They will have more pleasure in so ministering to you, than in the other way. For these things add respect both to you and to them, but those bring disgrace upon all together; upon you as an insolent person and a drunkard, upon them as wretched and gluttonous. For if you feed in order to insult them, it is worse than if you had put them to death; but if for their good and profit, it is more useful again than if you had brought them back from their way to execution. And now indeed thou dost disgrace them more than your servants, and your servants enjoy more liberty of speech, and freedom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, than they do; but then you will make them equal to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Set free therefore both them and your own self, and take away the name of parasite, and call them companions of your meals; cast away the appellation of flatterers, and bestow on them that of friends. With this intent indeed did God make our friendships, not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> to the beloved and loving, but for their good and profit.</p>
<p>But these friendships are more grievous than any enmity. For by our enemies, if we will, we are even profited; but by these we must needs be harmed, no question of it. Keep not then friends to teach you harm; keep not friends who are enamored rather of your table than of your friendship. For all such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, if you retrench your good living, retrench their friendship too; but they that associate with you for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue's</font></u></a> sake, remain continually, enduring every change.</p>
<p>And besides, the race of the parasites does often take revenge upon you, and bring upon you an ill fame. Hence at least I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> many respectable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to have got bad characters, and some have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> reported of for sorceries, some for adulteries and corrupting of youths. For whereas they have no work to do, but spend their own life unprofitably; their ministry is suspected by the multitude as being the same with that of corrupt youths.</p>
<p>Therefore, delivering ourselves both from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report, and above all from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> that is to come, and doing the things that are well-pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, let us put an end to this devilish custom, that <q>both eating and drinking we may do all things to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co010.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 10:31</font></u></a></span> and enjoy the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that comes from Him; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and might, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

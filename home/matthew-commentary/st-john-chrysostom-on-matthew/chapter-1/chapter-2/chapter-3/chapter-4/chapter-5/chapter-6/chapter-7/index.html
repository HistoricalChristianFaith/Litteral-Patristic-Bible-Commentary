<p><q>Judge not, that you be not judged.</q></p>
<p>What then? Ought we not to blame them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Because <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also says this selfsame thing: or rather, there too it is Christ, speaking by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, and saying, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 14:10</font></u></a></span> <q>Why do you judge your brother? And thou, why do you set at nought your brother?</q> and, <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 14:4</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:5</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>How then does He say elsewhere, <q>Reprove, rebuke, exhort,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:2</font></u></a></span> and, <q>Them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> rebuke before all?</q> And Christ too to Peter, <q>Go and tell him his fault between you and him alone,</q> and if he neglect to hear, add to yourself another also; and if not even so does he yield, declare it to the church likewise? And how has He set over us so many to reprove; and not only to reprove, but also to punish? For him that hearkens to none of these, He has commanded to be <q>as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> man and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:17</font></u></a></span> And how gave He them the keys also? Since if they are not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">judge</font></u></a>, they will be without authority in any matter, and in vain have they received the power to bind and to loose.</p>
<p>And besides, if this were to obtain, all would be lost alike, whether in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">churches</font></u></a>, or in states, or in houses. For except the master judge the servant, and the mistress the maid, and the father the son, and friends one another, there will be an increase of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. And why say I, friends? Unless we judge our enemies, we shall never be able to put an end to our enmity, but all things will be turned upside down.</p>
<p>What then can the saying be? Let us carefully attend, lest the medicines of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of peace, be accounted by any man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of overthrow and confusion. First of all, then, even by what follows, He has pointed out to them that have understanding the excellency of this law, saying, <q>Why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:3</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>But if to many of the less attentive, it seem yet rather obscure, I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">endeavor</font></u></a> to explain it from the beginning. In this place, then, as it seems at least to me, He does not simply command us not to judge any of men's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, neither does He simply forbid the doing of such a thing, but to them that are full of innumerable ills, and are trampling upon other men for trifles. And I think that certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> too are here hinted at, for that while they were bitter accusing their neighbors for small faults, and such as came to nothing, they were themselves insensibly committing deadly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Herewith towards the end also He was upbraiding them, when He said, <q>You bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, but you will not move them with your finger,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:4</font></u></a></span> and, <q>ye pay <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14741b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tithe</font></u></a> of mint and anise, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:23</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Well then, I think that these are comprehended in His invective; that He is checking them beforehand as to those things, wherein they were hereafter to accuse His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. For although His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> had been guilty of no such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, yet in them were supposed to be offenses; as, for instance, not keeping the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sabbath</font></u></a>, eating with unwashen hands, sitting at meat with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publicans</font></u></a>; of which He says also in another place, <q>You which strain at the gnat, and swallow the camel.</q> But yet it is also a general law that He is laying down on these matters.</p>
<p>And the Corinthians <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:5</font></u></a></span> too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> did not absolutely command not to judge, but not to judge their own superiors, and upon grounds that are not acknowledged; not absolutely to refrain from correcting them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. Neither indeed was He then rebuking all without distinction, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> doing so to their teachers were the object of His reproof; and they who, being guilty of innumerable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, bring an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report upon the guiltless.</p>
<p>This then is the sort of thing which Christ also in this place intimated; not intimated merely, but guarded it too with a great ter ror, and the punishment from which no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> can deliver.</p>
<p>2. <q>For with what judgment ye judge,</q> says He, <q>you shall be judged.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:2</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>That is, <q>it is not the other,</q> says Christ, <q>that you condemn, but yourself, and you are making the judgment-seat dreadful to yourself, and the account strict.</q> As then in the forgiveness of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> the beginnings are from us, so also in this judgment, it is by ourselves that the measures of our condemnation are laid down. You see, we ought not to upbraid nor trample upon them, but to admonish; not to revile, but to advise; not to assail with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, but to correct with tenderness. For not him, but yourself, do you give over to extreme vengeance, by not sparing him, when it may be needful to give sentence on his offenses.</p>
<p>Do you see, how these two commandments are both easy, and fraught with great blessings to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a>, even as of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> on the other hand, to the regardless? For both he that forgives his neighbor, has freed himself first of the two from the grounds of complaint, and that without any labor; and he that with tenderness and indulgence inquires into other men's offenses, great is the allowance of pardon, which he has by his judgment laid up beforehand for himself.</p>
<p><q>What then!</q> say you: <q>if one commit fornication, may I not say that fornication is a bad thing, nor at all correct him that is playing the wanton?</q> Nay, correct him, but not as a foe, nor as an adversary exacting a penalty, but as a physician providing medicines. For neither did Christ say, <q>stay not him that is sinning,</q> but <q>judge not;</q> that is, be not bitter in pronouncing sentence.</p>
<p>And besides, it is not of great things (as I have already observed), nor of things prohibited, that this is said, but of those which are not even counted offenses. Wherefore He said also.</p>
<p><q>Why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:3</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Yea, for many now do this; if they see but a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10487b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">monk</font></u></a> wearing an unnecessary garment, they produce against him the law of our Lord, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:10</font></u></a></span> while they themselves are extorting without end, and defrauding men every day. If they see him but partaking rather largely of food, they become bitter accusers, while they themselves are daily drinking to excess and surfeiting: not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a>, that besides their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, they do hereby gather up for themselves a greater flame, and deprive themselves of every plea. For on this point, that your own doings must be strictly inquired into, you yourself hast first made the law, by thus sentencing those of your neighbor. Account it not then to be a grievous thing, if you are also yourself to undergo the same kind of trial.</p>
<p><q>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:5</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Here His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> is to signify the great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, which He has against them that do such things. For so, wheresoever He would indicate that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is great, and the punishment and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> in store for it grievous, He begins with a reproach. As then unto him that was exacting the hundred pence, He said in His deep displeasure, <q>Thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> servant, I forgave you all that debt;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:32</font></u></a></span> even so here also, <q>Thou hypocrite.</q> For not of protecting care comes such a judgment, but of ill will to man; and while a man puts forward a mask of benevolence, he is doing a work of the utmost <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, causing reproaches without ground, and accusations, to cleave unto his neighbors, and usurping a teacher's rank, when he is not worthy to be so much as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. On account of this He called him <q>hypocrite.</q> For thou, who in other men's doings art so bitter, as to see even the little things; how have you become so remiss in your own, as that even the great things are hurried over by you?</p>
<p><q>First cast out the beam out of your own eye.</q></p>
<p>Do you see, that He forbids not judging, but commands to cast out first the beam from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eye</font></u></a>, and then to set right the doings of the rest of the world? For indeed each one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> his own things better than those of others; and sees the greater rather than the less; and loves himself more than his neighbor. Wherefore, if you do it out of guardian care, I bid you care for yourself first, in whose case the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is both more certain and greater. But if you neglect yourself, it is quite evident that neither do you judge your brother in care for him, but in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>, and wishing to expose him. For what if he ought to be judged? It should be by one who commits no such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, not by you.</p>
<p>Thus, because He had introduced great and high doctrines of self denial, lest any man should say, it is easy so to practise it in words; He willing to signify His entire confidence, and that He was not chargeable with any of the things that had been mentioned, but had duly fulfilled all, spoke this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. And that, because He too was afterwards to judge, saying, <q>Woe unto you, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scribes</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>, hypocrites.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:1</font></u></a></span> Yet was not he chargeable with what has been mentioned; for neither did He pull out a mote, nor had He a beam on His eyes, but being clean from all these, He so corrected the faults of all. <q>For it is not at all meet,</q> says He, <q>to judge others, when one is chargeable with the same things.</q> And why marvel at His establishing this law, when even the very thief <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> it upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, saying to the other thief, <q>Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, seeing we are in the same condemnation;</q> expressing the same sentiments with Christ?</p>
<p>But you, so far from casting out your own beam, dost not even see it, but another's mote thou not only see, but also judgest, and essayest to cast it out; as if any one seized with a grievous dropsy, or indeed with any other incurable disease, were to neglect this, and find fault with another who was neglecting a slight swelling. And if it be an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> not to see one's own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, it is a twofold and threefold <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> to be even sitting in judgment on others, while men themselves, as if past feeling, are bearing about beams in their own eyes: since no beam is so heavy as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>His injunction therefore in these words is as follows, that he who is chargeable with countless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a>, should not be a bitter censor of other men's offenses, and especially when these are trifling. He is not overthrowing reproof nor correction, but forbidding men to neglect their own faults, and exult over those of other men.</p>
<p>For indeed this was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of men's going unto great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>, bringing in a twofold <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. For he, whose practice it had been to slight his own faults, great as they were, and to search bitterly into those of others, being slight and of no account, was spoiling himself two ways: first, by thinking lightly of his own faults; next, by incurring enmities and feuds with all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and training himself every day to extreme fierceness, and want of feeling for others.</p>
<p>3. Having then put away all these things, by this His excellent legislation, He added yet another charge, saying,</p>
<p><q>Give not that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.</q> </p>
<p><q>Yet surely further on,</q> it will be said, He commanded, <q>What you have heard in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:27</font></u></a></span> But this is in no wise contrary to the former. For neither in that place did He simply command to tell all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but to whom it should be spoken, to them He bade speak with freedom. And by <q>dogs</q> here He figuratively described them that are living in incurable ungodliness, and affording no hope of change for the better; and by <q>swine,</q> them that abide continually in an unchaste life, all of whom He has pronounced unworthy of hearing such things. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also, it may be observed, declared this when He said, <q>But a natural man receives not the things of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, for they are foolishness unto him.</q> And in many other places too He says that corruption of life is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of men's not receiving the more perfect doctrines. Wherefore He commands not to open the doors to them; for indeed they become more insolent after learning. For as to the well-disposed and intelligent, things appear venerable when revealed, so to the insensible, when they are unknown rather. Since then from their nature, they are not able to learn them, <q>let the thing be hidden,</q> says He, <q>that at least for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> they may reverence them. For neither does the swine <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> at all what a pearl is. Therefore since he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not, neither let him see it, lest he trample under foot what he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not.</q></p>
<p>For nothing results, beyond greater mischief to them that are so disposed when they hear; for both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> things are profaned by them, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what they are; and they are the more lifted up and armed against us. For this is meant by, <q>lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</q> </p>
<p>Nay, <q>surely,</q> says one, <q>they ought to be so strong as to remain equally impregnable after men's learning them, and not to yield to other people occasions against us.</q> But it is not the things that yield it, but that these men are swine; even as when the pearl is trampled under foot, it is not so trampled, because it is really contemptible, but because it fell among swine.</p>
<p>And full well did He say, <q>turn again and rend you:</q> for they feign gentleness, so as to be taught: then after they have learned, quite changing from one sort to another, they jeer, mock and deride us, as deceived <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>. Therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also said to Timothy, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:15</font></u></a></span> <q>Of whom also beware; for he has greatly withstood our words;</q> and again in another place, <q>From such turn away,</q> and, <q>A man that is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a>, after the first and second admonition, reject.</q> </p>
<p>It is not, you see, that those truths furnish them with armor, but they become fools in this way of their own accord, being filled with more willfulness. On this account it is no small gain for them to abide in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, for so they are not such entire scorners. But if they learn, the mischief is twofold. For neither will they themselves be at all profited thereby, but rather the more damaged, and to you they will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> endless difficulties.</p>
<p>Let them hearken, who shamelessly associate with all, and make the awful things contemptible. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> we too therefore celebrate with closed doors, and keep out the uninitiated, not for any weakness of which we have convicted our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rites</font></u></a>, but because the many are as yet imperfectly prepared for them. For this very reason He Himself also discoursed much unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, <q>because they seeing saw not.</q> For this, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> likewise commanded <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how we ought to answer every man.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 4:6</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>4. <q>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:6</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>For inasmuch as He had enjoined things great and marvellous, and had commanded men to be superior to all their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and had led them up to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> itself, and had enjoined them to strive after the resemblance, not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> and archangels, but (as far as was possible) of the very Lord of all; and had bidden His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> not only themselves duly to perform all this, but also to correct others, and to distinguish between the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and them that are not such, the dogs and them that are not dogs (although there be much that is hidden in men):— that they might not say, <q>these things are grievous and intolerable,</q> (for indeed in the sequel Peter did utter some such things, saying, <q>Who can be saved?</q> and again, If the case of the man be so, it is not good to marry): in order therefore that they might not now likewise say so; as in the first place even by what had gone before He had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> it all to be easy, setting down many reasons one upon another, of power to persuade men: so after all He adds also the pinnacle of all facility, devising as no ordinary relief to our toils, the assistance derived from persevering <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>. Thus, we are not ourselves, says He, to strive alone, but also to invoke the help from above: and it will surely come and be present with us, and will aid us in our struggles, and make all easy. Therefore He both commanded us to ask, and pledged Himself to the giving.</p>
<p>However, not simply to ask did He command us, but with much assiduity and earnestness. For this is the meaning of <q>seek.</q> For so he that seeks, putting all things out of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, is taken up with that alone which is sought, and forms no idea of any of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> present. And this which I am saying they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, as many as have lost either gold, or servants, and are seeking diligently after them.</p>
<p>By <q>seeking,</q> then, He declared this; by <q>knocking,</q> that we approach with earnestness and a glowing mind.</p>
<p>Despond not therefore, O man, nor show less of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, than they do of desire for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. For things of that kind you have often sought and not found, but nevertheless, though thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this, that you are not sure to find them, you put in motion every mode of search; but here, although having a promise that you will surely receive, thou dost not show even the smallest part of that earnestness. And if you dost not receive straightway, do not even thus despair. For to this end He said, <q>knock,</q> to signify that even if He should not straightway open the door, we are to continue there.</p>
<p>5. And if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> my affirmation, at any rate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> His example.</p>
<p><q>For what man is there of you,</q> says He, <q>whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</q> </p>
<p>Because, as among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, if you keep on doing so, you are even accounted troublesome, and disgusting: so with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when you do not so, then thou dost more entirely provoke Him. And if you continue asking, though thou receive not at once, thou surely wilt receive. For to this end was the door shut, that He may induce you to knock: to this end He does not straightway assent, that you may ask. Continue then to do these things, and you will surely receive. For that you might not say, <q>What then if I should ask and not receive?</q> He has blocked up your approach with that similitude, again framing arguments, and by those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> things urging us to be confident on these matters; implying by them that we must not only ask, but ask what we ought. </p>
<p><q>For which of you is there, a father, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he give him a stone?</q> So that if you receive not, your asking a stone is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of your not receiving. For though thou be a son, this suffices not for your receiving: rather this very thing even hinders your receiving, that being a son, you ask what is not profitable.</p>
<p>Do thou also therefore ask nothing worldly, but all things spiritual, and you will surely receive. For so Solomon, because he asked what he ought, behold how quickly he received. Two things now, you see, should be in him that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, asking earnestly, and asking what he ought: <q>since you too,</q> says He, <q>though ye be fathers, wait for your sons to ask: and if they should ask of you anything inexpedient, you refuse the gifts; just as, if it be expedient, you consent and bestow it.</q> Do thou too, considering these things, not withdraw until thou receive; until thou have found, retire not; relax not your diligence, until the door be opened. For if you approach with this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and say, <q>Except I receive, I depart not;</q> you will surely receive, provided thou ask such things, as are both suitable for Him of whom you ask to give, and expedient for you the petitioner. But what are these? To seek the things spiritual, all of them; to forgive them that have trespassed, and so to draw near asking forgiveness; <q>to lift up <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> hands without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> and doubting.</q> If we thus ask, we shall receive. As it is, surely our asking is a mockery, and the act of drunken rather than of sober men.</p>
<p><q>What then,</q> says one, <q>if I ask even spiritual things, and do not receive?</q> You did not surely knock with earnestness; or you made yourself unworthy to receive; or quickly left off.</p>
<p><q>And wherefore,</q> it may be inquired, <q>did He not say, what things we ought to ask</q>? Nay verily, He has mentioned them all in what precedes, and has signified for what things we ought to draw near. Say not then, <q>I drew near, and did not receive.</q> For in no case is it owing to God that we receive not, God who loves us so much as to surpass even fathers, to surpass them as far as goodness does this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> nature.</p>
<p><q>For if you, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more your heavenly Father.</q> </p>
<p>Now this He said, not to bring an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> name on man's nature, nor to condemn our race as bad; but in contrast to His own goodness He calls paternal tenderness <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, so great is the excess of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to man.</p>
<p>Do you see an argument unspeakable, of power to arouse to good hopes even him that has become utterly desperate?</p>
<p>Now here indeed He signifies His goodness by means of our fathers, but in what precedes by the chief among His gifts, by the <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>,</q> by the body. And nowhere does He set down the chief of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, nor bring forward His own coming:— for He who thus made speed to give up His Son to the slaughter, <q>how shall He not freely give us all things?</q>— because it had not yet come to pass. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> indeed sets it forth, thus saying, <q>He that spared not His own Son, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:32</font></u></a></span> But His discourse with them is still from the things of men.</p>
<p>6. After this, to indicate that we ought neither to feel confidence in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, while neglecting our own doings; nor, when taking pains, trust only to our own endeavors; but both to seek after the help from above, and contribute withal our own part; He sets forth the one in connection with the other. For so after much exhortation, He taught also how to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, and when He had taught how to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, He proceeded again to His exhortation concerning what we are to do; then from that again to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a> continually, saying, <q>Ask,</q> and <q>seek,</q> and <q>knock.</q> And thence again, to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of being also diligent ourselves.</p>
<p><q>For all things,</q> says He, <q>whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them.</q> </p>
<p>Summing up all in brief, and signifying, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is compendious, and easy, and readily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And He did not merely say, <q>All things whatsoever ye would,</q> but, <q>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would.</q> For this word, <q>therefore,</q> He did not add without purpose, but with a concealed meaning: <q>if you desire,</q> says He, <q>to be heard, together with what I have said, do these things also.</q> What then are these? <q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you.</q> Do you see how He has hereby also signified that together with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> we need exact conversation? And He did not say, <q>whatsoever things you would to be done unto you of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, those do unto your neighbor;</q> lest you should say, <q>But how is it possible? He is God and I am man:</q> but, <q>whatsoever you would to be done unto you of your fellow servant, these things do thou also yourself show forth towards your neighbor.</q> What is less burdensome than this? What fairer?</p>
<p>Then the praise also, before the rewards, is exceeding great.</p>
<p><q>For this is the law and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>.</q> Whence it is evident, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is according to our nature; that we all, of ourselves, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> our duties; and that it is not possible for us ever to find refuge in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>7. <q>Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: and strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few there be that find it.</q> </p>
<p>And yet after this He said, <q>My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat011.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 11:30</font></u></a></span> And in what He has lately said also, He intimated the same: how then does He here say it is strait and confined? In the first place, if you attend, even here He points to it as very light, and easy, and accessible. <q>And how,</q> it may be said, <q>is the narrow and confined way easy?</q> Because it is a way and a gate; even as also the other, though it be wide, though spacious, is also a way and a gate. And of these there is nothing permanent, but all things are passing away, both the pains and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things of life.</p>
<p>And not only herein is the part of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> easy, but also by the end again it becomes yet easier. For not the passing away of our labors and toils, but also their issuing in a good end (for they end in life) is enough to console those in conflict. So that both the temporary nature of our labors, and the perpetuity of our crowns, and the fact that the labors come first, and the crowns after, must prove a very great relief in our toils. Wherefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also called their affliction <q>light</q>; not from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the events, but because of the mind of the combatants, and the hope of the future. <q>For our light affliction,</q> says he, <q>works an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> weight of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co004.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 4:17-18</font></u></a></span> For if to sailors the waves and the seas, to soldiers their slaughters and wounds, to husbandmen the winters and the frosts, to boxers the sharp blows, be light and tolerable things, all of them, for the hope of those rewards which are temporary and perishing; much more when heaven is set forth, and the unspeakable blessings, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> rewards, will no one feel any of the present hardships. Or if any account it, even thus, to be toilsome, the suspicion comes of nothing but their own remissness.</p>
<p>See, at any rate, how He on another side also makes it easy, commanding not to hold intercourse with the dogs, nor to give one's self over to the swine, and to <q>beware of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>;</q> thus on all accounts causing men to feel as if in real conflict. And the very fact too of calling it narrow contributed very greatly towards making it easy; for it wrought on them to be vigilant. As <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> then, when he says, <q>We wrestle not against flesh and blood,</q> does so not to cast down, but to rouse up the spirits of the soldiers: even so He also, to shake the travellers out of their sleep, called the way rough. And not in this way only did He work upon men, to be vigilant, but also by adding, that it contains likewise many to supplant them; and, what is yet more grievous, they do not even attack openly, but hiding themselves; for such is the race of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>. <q>But look not to this,</q> says He, <q>that it is rough and narrow, but where it ends; nor that the opposite is wide and spacious, but where it issues.</q></p>
<p>And all these things He says, thoroughly to awaken our alacrity; even as elsewhere also He said, <q>Violent men take it by force.</q> For whoever is in conflict, when he actually sees the judge of the lists marvelling at the painfulness of his efforts, is the more inspirited.</p>
<p>Let it not then bewilder us, when many things spring up hence, that turn to our vexation. For the way is strait, and the gate narrow, but not the city. Therefore must one neither look for rest here, nor there expect any more anything that is painful.</p>
<p>Now in saying, <q>Few there be that find it,</q> here again He both declared the careless ness of the generality, and instructed His hearers not to regard the felicities of the many, but the labors of the few. For the more part, says He, so far from walking this way, do not so much as make it their choice: a thing of most extreme criminality. But we should not regard the many, nor be troubled thereat, but emulate the few; and, by all means equipping ourselves, should so walk therein.</p>
<p>For besides that it is strait, there are also many to overthrow us in the way that leads there. Wherefore He also added,</p>
<p>8. <q>Beware of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>, for they will come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</q> Behold together with the dogs and swine another kind of ambush and conspiracy, far more grievous than that. For those are acknowledged and open, but these shaded over. For which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also, while from those He commanded to hold off, these He charged men to watch with exact care, as though it were not possible to see them at the first approach. Wherefore He also said, <q>beware</q>; making us more exact to discern them.</p>
<p>Then, lest when they had heard that it was narrow and strait, and that they must walk on a way opposite to the many, and must keep themselves from swine and dogs, and together with these from another more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> kind, even this of wolves; lest, I say, they should sink down at this multitude of vexations, having both to go a way contrary to most men, and therewith again to have such anxiety about these things: He reminded them of what took place in the days of their fathers, by using the term, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>,</q> for then also no less did such things happen. Be not now, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, troubled (so He speaks), for nothing new nor strange is to befall you. Since for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> is always secretly substituting its appropriate deceit.</p>
<p>And by the figure of <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>,</q> here, I think He shadows out not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, but them that are of a corrupt life, yet wear a mask of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; whom the generality are wont to call by the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>. Wherefore He also said further,</p>
<p><q>By their fruits you shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:16</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>For among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a> one may often find actual goodness, but among those whom I was mentioning, by no means.</p>
<p><q>What then,</q> it may be said, <q>if in these things too they counterfeit?</q> <q>Nay, they will be easily detected; for such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of this way, in which I commanded men to walk, painful and irksome; but the hypocrite would not choose to take pains, but to make a show only; wherefore also he is easily convicted.</q> Thus, inasmuch as He had said, <q>there be few that find it,</q> He clears them out again from among those, who find it not, yet feign so to do, by commanding us not to look to them that wear the masks only, but to them who in reality pursue it.</p>
<p><q>But wherefore,</q> one may say, <q>did He not make them manifest, but set us on the search for them?</q> That we might watch, and be ever prepared for conflict, guarding against our disguised as well as against our open enemies: which kind indeed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also was intimating, when he said, that <q>by their good words they deceive the hearts of the simple.</q> Let us not be troubled therefore, when we see many such even now. Nay, for this too Christ foretold from the beginning.</p>
<p>And see His gentleness: how He said not, <q>Punish them,</q> but, <q>Be not hurt by them,</q> <q>Do not fall among them unguarded.</q> Then that you might not say, <q>it is impossible to distinguish that sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>,</q> again He states an argument from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> example, thus saying,</p>
<p><q>Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree brings forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:16-18</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Now what He says is like this: they have nothing gentle nor sweet; it is the sheep only so far as the skin; wherefore also it is easy to discern them. And lest you should have any the least <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, He compares it to certain natural necessities, in matters which admit of no result but one. In which sense <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also said, <q>The carnal mind is death; for it is not subject to the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, neither indeed can be.</q> </p>
<p>And if He states the same thing twice, it is not tautology. But, lest any one should say, <q>Though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> tree bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit, it bears also good, and makes the distinction difficult, the crop being twofold:</q> <q>This is not so,</q> says He, <q>for it bears <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit only, and never can bear good: as indeed in the contrary case also.</q></p>
<p><q>What then? Is there no such thing as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man becoming <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>? And the contrary again takes place, and life abounds with many such examples.</q></p>
<p>But Christ says not this, that for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> there is no way to change, or that the good cannot fall away, but that so long as he is living in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, he will not be able to bear good fruit. For he may indeed change to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>; but while continuing in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, he will not bear good fruit.</p>
<p>What then? Did not David, being good, bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit? Not continuing good, but being changed; since, undoubtedly, had he remained always what he was, he would not have brought forth such fruit. For not surely while abiding in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, did he commit what he committed.</p>
<p>Now by these words He was also stopping the mouths of those who speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> at random, and putting a bridle on the lips of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumniators</font></u></a>. I mean, whereas many suspect the good by reason of the bad, He by this saying has deprived them of all excuse. <q>For you can not say, 'I am deceived and beguiled;' since I have given you exactly this way of distinguishing them by their works, having added the injunction to go to their actions, and not to confound all at random.</q></p>
<p>9. Then forasmuch as He had not commanded to punish, but only to beware of them, He, at once both to comfort those whom they vex, and to alarm and change them, set up as a bulwark against them the punishment they should receive at His hands, saying,</p>
<p><q>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:19</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Then, to make the saying less grievous, He added,</p>
<p><q>Wherefore by their fruits you shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them.</q> </p>
<p>That He might not seem to introduce the threatening as His leading topic, but to be stirring up their mind in the way of admonition and counsel.</p>
<p>Here He seems to me to be hinting at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> also, who were exhibiting such fruits. Wherefore also He reminded them of the sayings of John, in the very same terms delineating their punishment. For he too said the very same, making mention to them of an <q>axe,</q> and of a <q>tree cut down,</q> and of <q>unquenchable fire.</q></p>
<p>And though it appear indeed to be some single judgment, the being burnt up, yet if one examine carefully, these are two punishments. For he that is burnt is also cast of course out of God's kingdom; and this latter punishment is more grievous than the other. Now I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> indeed that many tremble only at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, but I affirm the loss of that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to be a far greater punishment than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. And if it be not possible to exhibit it such in words, this is nothing marvellous. For neither do we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the blessedness of those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, that we should on the other hand clearly perceive the wretchedness ensuing on being deprived of them; since <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> these things clearly, is aware, that to fall from Christ's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> is more grievous than all. And this we shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> at that time, when we shall fall into the actual trial of it.</p>
<p>But may this never be our case, O thou only-begotten <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>, neither may we ever have any experience of this irremediable punishment. For how great an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> it is to fall from those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, cannot indeed be accurately told: nevertheless, as I may be able, I will labor and strive by an example to make it clear to you, though it be but in some small degree.</p>
<p>Let us then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> a wondrous child, having besides His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> the dominion of the whole world, and in all respects so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, as to be capable of bringing all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> to the yearning of a father's affection. What theft do you think the father of this child would not gladly suffer, not to be cast out of His society? And what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, small or great, would he not welcome, on condition of seeing and enjoying Him? Now let us reason just so with respect to that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> also. For no child, be he never so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, is so desirable and lovely to a father, as the having our portion in those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, and <q>to depart and be with Christ.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi001.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 1:23</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>No <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and that punishment, is a thing not to be borne. Yet though one suppose ten thousand hells, he will utter nothing like what it will be to fail of that blessed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, to hear <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> you not,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:12</font></u></a></span> to be accused for not feeding Him when we saw Him an hungered. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse42" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:42</font></u></a></span> Yea, better surely to endure a thousand thunderbolts, than to see that face of mildness turning away from us, and that eye of peace not enduring to look upon us. For if He, while I was an enemy, and hating Him, and turning from Him, did in such wise follow after me, as not to spare even Himself, but to give Himself up unto death: when after all this I do not vouchsafe to Him so much as a loaf in His hunger, with what kind of eyes shall I ever again behold Him?</p>
<p>But mark even here His gentleness; in that He does not at all speak of His benefits, nor say, <q>You have despised Him that has done you so much good:</q> neither does He say, <q>Me, who brought you from that which is not into being, who breathed into you a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and set you over all things on earth, who for your sake made earth, and heaven, and sea, and air, and all things that are, who had been dishonored by you, yea accounted of less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and did not even so withdraw Himself, but had innumerable thoughts for you after it all; who chose to become a slave, who was beaten with rods and spit upon, who was slain, who died the most shameful death, who also on high makes intercession for you, who freely gives you His Spirit, who vouchsafes to you a kingdom, who makes you such promises, whose will it is to be unto you Head, and Bridegroom, and Garment, and House, and Root, and Meat, and Drink, and Shepherd, and King, and who has taken you to be brother, and heir, and joint-heir with Himself; who has brought you out of darkness into the dominion of light.</q> These things, I say, and more than these He might speak of, but He mentions none of these; but what? Only the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> itself.</p>
<p>Even here He shows His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and indicates the yearning which He has toward you: not saying, <q>Depart into the fire prepared for you,</q> but <q>prepared for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</q> And before He tells them what wrongs they had done, and neither so does He endure to mention all, but a few. And before these He calls the other sort, those who have done well, to signify from this too that He is blaming them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>What amount of punishment, then, is so grievous as these words? For if any one seeing but a man who was his benefactor an hungered, would not neglect him; or if he should neglect him, being upbraided with it, would choose rather to sink into the earth than to hear of it in the presence of two or three friends; what will be our feelings, on hearing these words in the presence of the whole world; such as He would not say even then, were He not earnestly accounting for His own doings? For that not to upbraid did He bring these things forward, but in self-defense, and for the sake of showing, that not without ground nor at random was He saying, <q>depart from me;</q> this is evident from His unspeakable benefits. For if He had been minded to upbraid, He would have brought forwards all these, but now He mentions only what treatment He had received.</p>
<p>10. Let us therefore, beloved, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> the hearing these words. Life is not a plaything: or rather our present life is a plaything, but the things to come are not such; or perchance our life is not a plaything only, but even worse than this. For it ends not in laughter, but rather brings exceeding damage on them who are not minded to order their own ways strictly. For what, I pray you, is the difference between children who are playing at building houses, and us when we are building our fine houses? What again between them making out their dinners, and us in our delicate fare? None, but just that we do it at the risk of being punished. And if we do not yet quite perceive the poverty of what is going on, no wonder, for we are not yet become men; but when we have become so, we shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that all these things are childish.</p>
<p>For so those other things too, as we grow to manhood, we laugh to scorn; but when we are children we account them to be worth anxiety; and while we are gathering together potsherds and mire we think no less of ourselves than they who are erecting their great circuits of walls. Nevertheless they straightway perish and fall down, and not even when standing can they be of any use to us, as indeed neither can those fine houses. For the citizen of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> they cannot receive, neither can he bear to abide in them, who has his country above; but as we throw down these with our feet, so he too those by his high spirit. And as we laugh at the children, weeping at that overthrow, even so these also, when we are bewailing it all, do not laugh only, but weep also: because both their bowels are compassionate, and great is the mischief thence arising.</p>
<p>Let us therefore become men. How long are we to crawl on the earth, priding ourselves on stones and stocks? How long are we to play? And would we played only! But now we even betray our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>; and as children when they neglect their learning, and practise themselves in these things at their leisure, suffer very severe blows; even so we too, spending all our diligence herein, and having then our spiritual lessons required of us in our works, and not being able to produce them, shall have to pay the utmost penalty. And there is none to deliver us; though he be father, brother, what you will. But while these things shall all pass away, the torment ensuing upon them remains <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> and unceasing; which sort of thing indeed takes place with respect to the children as well, their father destroying their childish toys altogether for their idleness, and causing them to weep incessantly.</p>
<p>11. And to convince you that these things are such, let us bring before us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, that which more than anything seems to be worthy of our pains, and let us set against it a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> (which soever you will), and then shall you see most clearly the vileness thereof. Let us, I say, suppose there are two men (and I do not now speak of injuriousness, but as yet of honest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>); and of these two, let the one get together money, and sail on the sea, and till the land, and find many other ways of merchandise (although I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not quite, whether, so doing, he can make honest gains); nevertheless let it be so, and let it be granted that his gains are gotten with honesty; that he buys fields, and slaves, and all such things, and suppose no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a> connected therewith. But let the other one, possessing as much, sell fields, sell houses, and vessels of gold and silver, and give to the poor; let him supply the necessitous, heal the sick, free such as are in straits, some let him deliver from bonds, others let him release that are in mines, these let him bring back from the noose, those, who are captives, let him rescue from their punishment. Of whose side then would you be? And we have not as yet spoken of the future, but as yet of what is here. Of whose part then would ye be? His that is gathering gold, or his that is doing away with calamities? With him that is purchasing fields, or him who is making himself a harbor of refuge for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human race</font></u></a>? Him that is clothed with much gold, or him that is crowned with innumerable blessings? Is not the one like some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> come down from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> for the amendment of the rest of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>; but the other not so much as like a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, but like some little child that is gathering all together vainly and at random?</p>
<p>But if to get money honestly be thus absurd, and of extreme <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>; when not even the honesty is there, how can such a man choose but be more wretched than any? I say, if the absurdity be so great; when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> is added thereto, and the loss of the kingdom, how great wailings are due to him, both living and dead?</p>
<p>12. Or will you that we take in hand some other part also of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>? Let us then introduce again another man, who is in power, commanding all, invested with great dignity, having a gorgeous herald, and girdle, and lictors, and a large company of attendants. Does not this seem great, and meet to be called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>? Well then, against this man again let us set another, him that is patient of injuries, and meek, and lowly, and long suffering; and let this last be despitefully used, be beaten, and let him bear it quietly, and bless them that are doing such things.</p>
<p>Now which is the one to be admired, I pray you? He that is puffed up, and inflamed, or he that is self-subdued? Is not the one again like the powers above, that are so free from passion, but the other like a blown bladder, or a man who has the dropsy, and great inflammation? The one like a spiritual physician, the other, a ridiculous child that is puffing out his cheeks?</p>
<p>For why do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> yourself, O man? Because you are borne on high in a chariot? Because a yoke of mules is drawing you? And what is this? Why, this one may see befalling mere logs of wood and stones. Is it that you are clothed with beautiful garments? But look at him that is clad with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> for garments, and you will see yourself to be like withering hay, but him like a tree that bears marvellous fruit, and affords much delight to the beholders. For you are bearing about food for worms and moths, who, if they should set upon you, will quickly strip you bare of this adorning (for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> garments and gold and silver, are the one, the spinning of worms; the other earth and dust, and again become earth and nothing more): but he that is clothed with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> has such raiment, as not only worms cannot hurt, but not even death itself. And very naturally; for these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtues</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> have not their origin from the earth, but are a fruit of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>; wherefore neither are they subject to the mouths of worms. Nay, for these garments are woven in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, where is neither moth, nor worm, nor any other such thing.</p>
<p>Which then is better, tell me? To be rich, or to be poor? To be in power, or in dishonor? In luxury, or in hunger? It is quite clear; to be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and enjoyment, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. Therefore, if you would have the things and not the names, leave the earth and what is here, and find you a place to anchor in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>: for what is here is a shadow, but all things there are immovable, steadfast, and beyond any assault.</p>
<p>Let us therefore choose them with all diligent care, that we may be delivered from the turmoil of the things here, and having sailed into that calm harbor, may be found with our lading abundant, and with that unspeakable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> of almsgiving; unto which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant we may all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and the might, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><q>Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, but he that does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of my Father which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Wherefore said He not, <q>but he that does my will?</q> Because for the time it was a great gain for them to receive even this first; yea it was very great, considering their weakness. And moreover He intimated the one also by the other. And withal this may be mentioned, that in fact there is no other will of the Son besides that of the Father.</p>
<p>And here He seems to me to be censuring the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> chiefly, laying as they did the whole stress upon the doctrines, and taking no care of practice. For which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also blames them, saying, <q>Behold you are called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest your boast of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>:</q> <q>Who then are these men?</q> you ask. Many of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> received gifts such as he that was casting out devils, and was not with Him; such as Judas; for even he too, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> as he was, had a gift. And in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a> also this may be found, in that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> has oftentimes wrought upon unworthy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, that it might do good to others. That is, since all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> were not meet for all things, but some were of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pure life</font></u></a>, not having so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and others just the contrary; by these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sayings</font></u></a>, while He urges the one to show forth much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, the others too He was summoning by this His unspeakable gift to become better men. Wherefore also with great abundance did He bestow that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. For <q>we wrought,</q> it is said, <q>many mighty works.</q> But <q>then will I profess unto them, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> you not.</q> For <q>now indeed they suppose they are my friends; but then shall they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, that not as to friends did I give to them.</q></p>
<p>And why marvel if He has bestowed gifts on men that have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> on Him, though without life suitable to their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, when even on those who have fallen from both these, He is unquestionably found working? For so Balaam was an alien both from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> good life; nevertheless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> wrought on him for the service of other men. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a> too was of the same sort: yet for all that even to him He signified the things to come. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> was very full of iniquity; yet to him again He revealed what was to follow after many generations. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan003.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel iii</font></u></a></span> And again to the son of this last, though surpassing his father in iniquity, He signified the things to come, ordering a marvellous and great dispensation. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan005.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel v</font></u></a></span> Accordingly because then also the beginnings of the gospel were taking place, and it was requisite that the manifestation of its power should be abundant, many even of the unworthy used to receive gifts. Howbeit, from those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> no gain accrued to them; rather they are the more punished. Wherefore unto them did He utter even that fearful saying, <q>I never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> you:</q> there being many for whom His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> begins already even here; whom He turns away from, even before the judgment.</p>
<p>Let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> therefore, beloved; and let us take great heed to our life, neither let us account ourselves worse off, in that we do not work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> now. For that will never be any advantage to us, as neither any disadvantage in our not working them, if we take heed to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Because for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> we ourselves are debtors, but for our life and our doings we have God our debtor.</p>
<p>3.

<p>As thus: What they shall suffer who do not (although they work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>), you have heard; but you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> also what such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> all these sayings shall enjoy; not in the world to come only, but even here. <q>For whosoever,</q> says He, <q>hears these sayings of mine, and does them, shall be likened to a wise man.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how He varies His discourse; at one time saying, <q>Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord,</q> and revealing Himself; at another time, <q>He that does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of my Father;</q> and again, bringing in Himself as judge, <q>For many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and I will say, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> you not.</q> And here again He indicates Himself to have the power over all, this being why He said, <q>Whosoever hears these sayings of mine.</q></p>
<p>Thus whereas all His discourse had been touching the future; of a kingdom, and an unspeakable reward and consolation, and the like; His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> is, out of things here also to give them their fruits, and to signify how great is the strength of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> even in the present life. What then is this her strength? To live in safety, to be easily subdued by no terror, to stand superior to all that despitefully use us. To this what can be equal? For this, not even he that wears the diadem can provide for himself, but that man who follows after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For he alone is possessed of it in full abundance: in the ebb and flow of the things present he enjoys a great calm. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> marvellous thing being this, that not in fair weather, but when the storm is vehement, and the turmoil great, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a> continual, he cannot be shaken ever so little.</p>
<p><q>For the rain descended,</q> says He, <q>the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:25</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>By <q>rain</q> here, and <q>floods,</q> and <q>winds,</q> He is expressing metaphorically the calamities and afflictions that befall men; such as false accusations, plots, bereavements, deaths, loss of friends, vexations from strangers, all the ills in our life that any one could mention. <q>But to none of these,</q> says He, <q>does such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> give way; and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> is, it is founded on the rock.</q> He calls the steadfastness of His doctrine a rock; because in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> His commands are stronger than any rock, setting one above all the waves of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> affairs. For he who keeps these things strictly, will not have the advantage of men only when they are vexing him, but even of the very devils plotting against him. And that it is not vain boasting so to speak, Job is our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, who received all the assaults of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and stood unmoveable; and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> too are our witnesses, for that when the waves of the whole world were beating against them, when both nations and princes, both their own people and strangers, both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and every engine was set in motion, they stood firmer than a rock, and dispersed it all.</p>
<p>And now, what can be happier than this kind of life? For this, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, not strength of body, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, not power, nor ought else will be able to secure, but only the possession of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For there is not, nay there is not another life we may find free from all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, but this alone. And you are witnesses, who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the plots in king's courts, the turmoils and the troubles in the houses of the rich. But there was not among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> any such thing.</p>
<p>What then? Did no such thing befall them? Did they suffer no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> at any man's hand? Nay, the marvel is this above all things, that they were indeed the object of many plots, and many storms burst upon them, but their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> was not overset by them, nor thrown into despair, but with naked bodies they wrestled, prevailed, and triumphed.</p>
<p>Thou then likewise, if you be willing to perform these things exactly, shall laugh all ills to scorn. Yea, for if you be but strengthened with such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> as is in these admonitions, nothing shall be able to hurt you. Since in what is he to harm you, who is minded to lay plots? Will he take away your money? Well, but before their threatening you were commanded to despise it, and to abstain from it so exceedingly, as not so much as even to ask any such thing of your Lord. But does he cast you into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>? Why, before your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, you were enjoined so to live, as to be crucified even to all the world. But does he speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>? Nay, from this pain also Christ has delivered you, by promising you without toil a great reward for the endurance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and making you so clear from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> and vexation hence arising, as even to command you to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for them. But does he banish you and involve you in innumerable ills? Well, he is making the crown more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> for you. But does he destroy and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> you? Even hereby he profits you very greatly, procuring for you the rewards of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a>, and conducting you more quickly into the untroubled haven, and affording you matter for a more abundant recompence, and contriving for you to make a gain of the universal penalty. Which thing indeed is most marvellous of all, that the plotters, so far from injuring at all, do rather make the objects of their despite more approved. To this what can be comparable? I mean, to the choice of such a mode of life as this, and no other, is.</p>
<p>Thus whereas He had called the way strait and narrow; to soothe our labors on this side also, He signifies the security thereof to be great, and great the pleasure; even as of the opposite course great is the unsoundness, and the detriment. For as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> even from things here was signified by Him to have her rewards, so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> also her penalties. For what I am ever saying, that I will say now also: that in both ways He is everywhere bringing about the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of His hearers on the one hand by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, on the other by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>. Thus, because there would be some to admire what He said, while they yield no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of it by their works, He by anticipation awakens their fears, saying, Though the things spoken be good, hearing is not sufficient for security, but there is need also of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> in actions, and the whole lies chiefly in this. And here He ends His discourse, leaving the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> at its height in them.</p>
<p>For as with regard to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, not only from the things to come did He urge them (speaking of a kingdom, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and an unspeakable reward, and comfort, and the unnumbered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things): but also from the things present, indicating the firm and immoveable quality of the Rock; so also with respect to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, not from the expected things only does He excite their fears (as from the tree that is cut down, and the unquenchable fire, and the not entering into the kingdom, and from His saying, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> you not</q>): but also from the things present, the downfall, I mean, in what is said of the house.</p>
<p>4. Wherefore also He made His argument more expressive, by trying its force in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>; for it was not the same thing to say, <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> man shall be impregnable, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> easily subdued,</q> as to suppose a rock, and a house, and rivers, and rain, and wind, and the like.</p>
<p><q>And every one,</q> says He, <q>that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.</q> </p>
<p>And well did He call this man <q>foolish</q>: for what can be more senseless than one building a house on the sand, and while he submits to the labor, depriving himself of the fruit and refreshment, and instead thereof undergoing punishment? For that they too, who follow after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, do labor, is surely manifest to every one: since both the extortioner, and the adulterer, and the false accuser, toil and weary themselves much to bring their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> to effect; but so far from reaping any profit from these their labors, they rather undergo great loss. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> too intimated this when he said, <q>He that sows to his flesh, shall of his flesh reap corruption.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:8</font></u></a></span> To this man are they like also, who build on the sand; as those that are given up to fornication, to wantonness, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, to all the other things.</p>
<p>Such an one was Ahab, but not such Elijah (since when we have put <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> along side of one another, we shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> more accurately the difference): for the one had built upon the rock, the other on the sand; wherefore though he were a king, he feared and trembled at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, at him that had only his sheepskin. Such were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> but not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>; and so though they were few and in bonds, they exhibited the steadfastness of the rock; but those, many as they were, and in armor, the weakness of the sand. For so they said, <q>What shall we do to these men?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:16</font></u></a></span> Do you see those in perplexity, not who are in the hands of others, and bound, but who are active in holding down and binding? And what can be more strange than this? Have you hold of the other, and art yet in utter perplexity? Yes, and very naturally. For inasmuch as they had built all on the sand, therefore also were they weaker than all. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also they said again, <q>What do ye, seeking to bring this man's blood upon us?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:28</font></u></a></span> What says he? Do you scourge, and are you in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? Do you entreat despitefully, and art in dismay? Do you judge, and yet tremble? So feeble is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But the Apostles not so, but how? <q>We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:20</font></u></a></span> Do you see a noble spirit? Do you see a rock laughing waves to scorn? Do you see a house unshaken? And what is yet more marvellous; so far from turning cowards themselves at the plots formed against them, they even took more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a>, and cast the others into greater anxiety. For so he that smites adamant, is himself the one smitten; and he that kicks against the pricks, is himself the one pricked, the one on whom the severe wounds fall: and he who is forming plots against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, is himself the one in jeopardy. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> becomes so much the weaker, the more it sets itself in array against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. And as he who wraps up fire in a garment, extinguishes not the flame, but consumes the garment; so he that is doing despite to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> men, and oppressing them, and binding them, makes them more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, but destroys himself. For the more ills you suffer, living righteously, the stronger are you become; since the more we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> self-restraint, the less we need anything; and the less we need anything, the stronger we grow, and the more above all. Such a one was John; wherefore him no man pained, but he caused pain to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a>; so he that had nothing prevailed against him that ruled; and he that wore a diadem, and purple, and endless pomp, trembles, and is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of him that is stripped of all, and not even when beheaded could he without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> see his head. For that even after his death he had the terror of him in full strength, hear what He says, <q>This is John, whom I slew.</q> Now the expression, <q>I slew,</q> is that of one not exulting, but soothing his own terror, and persuading his troubled <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to call to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, that he himself slew him. So great is the force of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that even after death it is more powerful than the living. For this same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> again, when he was living, they that possessed much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> came unto him, and said, <q>What shall we do?</q> Is so much yours, and are you minded to learn the way of your prosperity from him that has nothing? The rich from the poor? The soldiers from him that has not even a house?</p>
<p>Such an one was Elias too: wherefore also with the same freedom did he discourse to the people. For as the former said, <q>You generation of vipers;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:7</font></u></a></span> so this latter, <q>How long will you halt upon both your hips?</q> And the one said, <q>Have you killed, and inherited?</q> the other, <q>It is not lawful for you to have your brother Philip's wife.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:18</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Do you see the rock? Do you see the sand; how easily it sinks down, how it yields to calamities? How it is overthrown, though it have the support of royalty, of number, of nobility? For them that pursue it, it makes more senseless than all.</p>
<p>And it does not merely fall, but with great calamity: for <q>great indeed,</q> He says, <q>was the fall of it.</q> The risk not being of trifles, but of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, of the loss of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> blessings. Or rather even before that loss, no life so wretched as he must live that follows after this; dwelling with continual despondencies, alarms, cares, anxieties; which a certain wise man also was intimating when he said, <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> flees, when no man is pursuing.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro028.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 28:1</font></u></a></span> For such men tremble at their shadows, suspect their friends, their enemies, their servants, such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them, such as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them not; and before their punishment, suffer extreme punishment here. And to declare all this, Christ said, <q>And great was the fall of it;</q> shutting up these good commandments with that suitable ending, and persuading even by the things present the most unbelieving to flee from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>For although the argument from what is to come be vaster, yet is this of more power to restrain the grosser sort, and to withdraw them from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. Wherefore also he ended with it, that the profit thereof might make its abode in them.</p>
<p>Conscious therefore of all these things, both the present, and the future, let us flee from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>, let us emulate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that we may not labor fruitlessly and at random, but may both enjoy the security here, and partake of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> there: unto which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant we may all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and the might forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><em><q>And it came to pass, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at His doctrine.</q></em> </p>
<p>Yet was it rather natural for them to grieve at the unpleasantness of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200125.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sayings</font></u></a>, and to shudder at the loftiness of His injunctions; but now so great was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200125.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">power</font></u></a> of the Teacher, that many of them were even caught thereby, and thrown into very great admiration, and persuaded by reason of the sweetness of His sayings, not even when He ceased to speak, to depart from Him at all afterwards. For neither did the hearers depart, He having come down from the mountain, but even then the whole auditory followed Him; so great a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> for His sayings had He instilled into them.</p>
<p>But they were astonished most of all at His authority. For not with reference to another, like the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, did He say what He said; but everywhere indicating Himself to be the person that had the power of deciding. For so, when setting forth His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, He still kept adding, <q>But I say unto you.</q> And in reminding them of that day, He declared Himself to be the judge, both by the punishments, and by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And yet it was likely that this too would disturb them. For if, when they saw Him by His works showing forth His authority, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a> were for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoning</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuting</font></u></a> Him; while there were words only to prove this, how was it other than likely for them to be offended? And especially when at first setting out these things were said, and before He had given <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of His own power? But however, they felt nothing of this; for when the heart and mind is candid, it is easily persuaded by the words of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>. And this is just why one sort, even when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> were proclaiming His power, were offended; while the other on hearing mere words were persuaded and followed Him. This, I would add, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> too is intimating, when he says, <q>great multitudes followed Him,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat008.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 8:1</font></u></a></span> not any of the rulers, nor of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a>, but as many as were free from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>, and had their judgment uncorrupted. And throughout the whole gospel you see that such clave unto Him. For both while He spoke, they used to listen in silence, not making any intrusion, nor breaking in upon the connection of His sayings, nor tempting Him, and desiring to find a handle like the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>; and after His exhortation they followed Him again, marvelling.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray you, the Lord's consideration, how He varies the mode of profiting His hearers, after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> entering on words, and again from the instruction by His words passing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. Thus, both before they went up into the mountain, He healed many, preparing the way for His sayings; and after finishing that long discourse to the people, He comes again to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, confirming what had been said by what was done. And so, because He was teaching as <q>one having authority,</q> lest His so teaching should be thought boasting and arrogant, He does the very same in His works also, as having authority to heal; that they might no more be perplexed at seeing Him teach in this way, when He was working His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> also in the same.</p>
<p>2. <q>For when He had come down from the mountain, there came a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a>, saying, Lord, if You will, You can make me clean.</q> Great was the understanding and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of him who so drew near. For he did not interrupt the teaching, nor break through the auditory, but awaited the proper time, and approaches Him <q>when He has come down.</q> And not at random, but with much earnestness, and at His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200125.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knees</font></u></a>, he beseeches Him, as another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> says, and with the genuine <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and right <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200125.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">opinion</font></u></a> about him. For neither did he say, <q>If Thou request it of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> nor, <q>If Thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>,</q> but, <q>If You will, You can make me clean.</q> Nor did he say, <q>Lord, cleanse me,</q> but leaves all to Him, and makes His recovery depend on Him, and testifies that all the authority is His.</p>
<p><q>What then,</q> says one, <q>if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper's</font></u></a> opinion was mistaken?</q> It were meet to do away with it, and to reprove, and set it right. Did He then so do? By no means; but quite on the contrary, He establishes and confirms what had been said. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, you see, neither did He say, <q>Be thou cleansed,</q> but, <q>I will, be thou clean;</q> that the doctrine might no longer be a thing of the other's surmising, but of His own approval.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> not so: rather in what way? The whole people being in amazement, they said, <q>Why give heed to us, as though by our own power or authority we had made him to walk?</q> But the Lord, though He spoke oftentimes many things modestly, and beneath His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, what says He here, to establish the doctrine of them that were amazed at Him for His authority? <q>I will, be thou clean.</q> Although in the many and great signs which He wrought, He nowhere appears to have uttered this word. Here however, to confirm the surmise both of all the people and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> touching His authority, He purposely added, <q>I will.</q></p>
<p>And it was not that He said this, but did it not; but the work also followed immediately. Whereas, if he had not spoken well, but the saying had been a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a>, the work ought to have been interrupted. But now nature herself gave way at His command, and that speedily, as was meet, even more speedily than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> has said. For the word, <q>immediately,</q> falls far short of the quickness that there was in the work.</p>
<p>But He did not merely say, <q>I will, be thou clean,</q> but He also <q>put forth His hand, and touched him;</q> a thing especially worthy of inquiry. For wherefore, when cleansing him by will and word, did He add also the touch of His hand? It seems to me, for no other end, but that He might signify by this also, that He is not subject to the law, but is set over it; and that to the clean, henceforth, nothing is unclean. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit001.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 1:15</font></u></a></span> For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, we see, Elisha did not so much as see Naaman, but though he perceived that he was offended at his not coming out and touching him, observing the strictness of the law, he abides at home, and sends him to Jordan to wash. Whereas the Lord, to signify that He heals not as a servant, but as absolute master, does also touch. For His hand became not unclean from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprosy</font></u></a>, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprous</font></u></a> body was rendered clean by His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> hand.</p>
<p>Because, as we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, He came not to heal bodies only, but also to lead the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> unto self-command. As therefore He from that time forward no more forbad to eat with unwashen hands, introducing that excellent law, which relates to the indifference of meats; just so in this case also, to instruct us for the future, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> must be our care—that leaving the outward purifications, we must wipe that clean, and dread the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprosy</font></u></a> thereof alone, which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> (for to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> is no hindrance to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>):— He Himself first touches the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a>, and no man finds fault. For the tribunal was not corrupt, neither were the spectators under the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. Therefore, so far from blaming, they were on the contrary astonished at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, and yielded thereto: and both for what He said, and for what He did, they adored his uncontrollable power.</p>
<p>3. Having therefore healed his body, He bids him,</p>
<p><q>Tell no man, but show himself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, and offer the gift that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> commanded, for a testimony unto them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat008.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 8:4</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p>Now some say, that for this intent He bade him tell no man, that they might practise no craft about the discerning of his cure; a very foolish suspicion on their part. For He did not so cleanse as to leave the cleansing questionable, but He bids him <q>tell no man,</q> teaching us to avoid boasting and vainglory. And yet He well <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> that the other would not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>, but would proclaim his benefactor: nevertheless He does His own part.</p>
<p><q>How then elsewhere does He bid them tell of it?</q> one may ask. Not as jostling with or opposing Himself, but as teaching men to be grateful. For neither in that place did He give command to proclaim Himself, but to <q>give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>;</q> by this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> training us to be clear of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> and vainglory, by the other to be thankful and grateful; and instructing on every occasion to offer to the Lord the praise of all things that befall us. That is, because men for the most part remember God in sickness, but grow slacker after recovery; He bids them continually both in sickness and in health to give heed to the Lord, in these words, <q>give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>But wherefore did He command him also to show himself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, and to offer a gift? To fulfill the law here again. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/lev014.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Leviticus 14:1-32</font></u></a></span> For neither did He in every instance set it aside, nor in every instance keep it, but sometimes He did the one, sometimes the other; by the one making way for the high rule of life that was to come, by the other checking for a while the insolent speech of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and condescending to their infirmity. And why marvel, if just at the beginning He Himself did this, when even the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, after they were commanded to depart unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, after the doors were opened for their teaching throughout the world, and the law shut up, and the commandments made new, and all the ancient things had ceased, are found sometimes observing the law, sometimes neglecting it?</p>
<p>But what, it may be said, does this saying, <q>Show yourself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>,</q> contribute to the keeping of the law? No little. Because it was an ancient law, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> when cleansed should not entrust to himself the judgment of his cleansing, but should show himself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, and present the demonstration thereof to his eyes, and by that sentence be numbered among the clean. For if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> said not <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a> is cleansed,</q> he remained still with the unclean without the camp. Wherefore he says, <q>Show yourself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, and offer the gift that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> commanded.</q> He said not, <q>which I command,</q> but for a time remits him to the law, by every means stopping their mouths. Thus, lest they should say, He had seized upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests'</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; though He performed the work Himself, yet the approving it He entrusted to them, and made them sit as judges of His own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. <q>Why, I am so far,</q> He says, <q>from striving either with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> or with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, that I guide the objects of my favor to submit themselves unto them.</q></p>
<p>But what is, <q>for a testimony unto them</q>? For reproof, for demonstration, for accusation, if they be unthankful. For since they said, as a deceiver and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostor</font></u></a> we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecute</font></u></a> Him, as an adversary of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and a transgressor of the law; <q>You shall bear me <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>at that time, that I am not a transgressor of the law. Nay, for having healed you, I remit you to the law, and to the approval of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>;</q> which was the act of one honoring the law, and admiring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, and not setting himself in opposition to the ancient doctrines.</p>
<p>And if they were not in fact to be the better, hereby most of all one may perceive His respect for the law, that although He foreknew they would reap no benefit, He fulfilled all His part. For this very thing He did indeed foreknow, and foretold it: not saying, <q>for their correction,</q> neither, <q>for their instruction,</q> but, <q>for a testimony unto them,</q> that is, for accusation, and for reproof, and for a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> that all has been done on my part; and though I foreknew they would continue incorrigible, not even so did I omit what ought to be done; only they continued keeping up to the end their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. </p>
<p>This, we may observe, He says elsewhere also; <q>This gospel shall be preached in all the world for a testimony to all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nations</font></u></a>, and then shall the end come;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:14</font></u></a></span> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nations</font></u></a>, to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> not, to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not. Thus, lest any one should say, <q>And wherefore preach to all, if all are not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>?</q>— it is that I may be found to have done all my own part, and that no man may hereafter be able to find fault, as though he had not heard. For the very preaching shall bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> against them, and they will not be able hereafter to say, <q>We heard not;</q> for the word of godliness <q>has gone out unto the ends of the world.</q> </p>
<p>4. Therefore bearing these things in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, let us also fulfill all our duties to our neighbor, and to God let us give thanks continually. For it is too monstrous, enjoying as we do His bounty in deed every day, not so much as in word to acknowledge the favor; and this, though the acknowledgment again yield all its profit to us. Since He needs not, be sure, anything of ours: but we stand in need of all things from Him. Thus thanksgiving itself adds nothing to Him, but causes us to be nearer to Him. For if men's bounties, when we call them to memory, do the more warm us with their proper love-charm; much more when we are continually bringing to mind the noble acts of our Lord towards us, shall we be more diligent in regard of His commandments.</p>
<p>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also said, <q>Be thankful.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col003.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 3:15</font></u></a></span> For the best preservative of any benefit is the remembrance of the benefit, and a continual thanksgiving.</p>
<p>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> even the awful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, so full of that great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, which are celebrated at every communion, are called a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> of thanksgiving, because they are the commemoration of many benefits, and they signify the very sum of God's care for us, and by all means they work upon us to be thankful. For if His being born of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgin</font></u></a> was a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05645a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evangelist</font></u></a> said in amaze, <q>now all this was done;</q> His being also slain, what place shall we find for that? Tell me. I mean, if to be born is called <q>all this;</q> to be crucified, and to pour forth His blood, and to give Himself to us for a spiritual feast and banquet—what can that be called? Let us therefore give Him thanks continually, and let this precede both our words and our works.</p>
<p>But let us be thankful not for our own blessings alone, but also for those of others; for in this way we shall be able both to destroy our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, and to rivet our charity, and make it more genuine. Since it will not even be possible for you to go on envying them, in behalf of whom you give thanks to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> also enjoins to give thanks for the world, for the former things, for the things that are now, for what has been done to us before, for what shall befall us hereafter, when that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> is set forth.</p>
<p>For this is the thing both to free us from earth, and to remove us into heaven, and to make us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> instead of men. Because they too form a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a>, and give thanks to God for His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things bestowed on us, saying, <q>Glory to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</q> <q>And what is this to us, that are not upon earth, nor are men?</q> <q>Nay, it is very much to us, for we have been taught so to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> our fellow serv ants, as even to account their blessings ours.</q></p>
<p>Wherefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also, everywhere in his epistles, gives thanks for God's gracious acts to the world.</p>
<p>Let us too therefore continually give thanks, for our own blessings, and for those of others, alike for the small and for the great. For though the gift be small, it is made great by being God's gift, or rather, there is nothing small that comes from Him, not only because it is bestowed by Him, but also in its very nature.</p>
<p>And to pass over all the rest, which exceed the sand in multitude; what is equal to the dispensation that has taken place for our sake? In that what was more precious to Him than all, even His only-begotten Son, Him He gave for us His enemies; and not only gave, but after giving, did even set Him before us as food; Himself doing all things that were for our good, both in giving Him, and in making us thankful for all this. For because man is for the most part unthankful, He does Himself everywhere take in hand and bring about what is for our good. And what He did with respect to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, by places, and times, and feasts, reminding them of His benefits, that He did in this case also, by the manner of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> bringing us to a perpetual remembrance of His bounty in these things.</p>
<p>No one has so labored that we should be approved, and great, and in all things right-minded, as the God who made us. Wherefore both against our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> He befriends us often, and without our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> oftener than not. And if you marvel at what I have said, I point to this as having occurred not to any ordinary person, but to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>. For even that blessed man, when in much danger and affliction, often besought God that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a> might depart from him: nevertheless God regarded not his request, but his profit, and to signify this He said, <q>My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co012.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 12:9</font></u></a></span> So that before He has told him the reason, He benefits him against his will, and without his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> it.</p>
<p>5. Now what great thing does He ask, in requiring us to be thankful in return for such tender care? Let us then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>, and everywhere keep up this. Since neither were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> by anything ruined so much, as by being unthankful; those many stripes, one after another, were brought upon them by nothing else than this; or rather even before those stripes this had ruined and corrupted their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. <q>For the hope of the unthankful,</q> says one, <q>is like the winter's hoar frost;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/wis016.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Wisdom 16:29</font></u></a></span> it benumbs and deadens the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, as that does our bodies.</p>
<p>And this springs from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, and from thinking one's self worthy of something. But the contrite will acknowledge grounds of thanksgiving to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things only, but also for what seem to be adverse; and how much soever he may suffer, will count none of his sufferings undeserved. Let us then also, the more we advance in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, so much the more make ourselves contrite; for indeed this, more than anything else is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Because, as the sharper our sight is, the more thoroughly do we learn how distant we are from the sky; so the more we advance in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, so much the more are we instructed in the difference between God and us. And this is no small part of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom, to be able to perceive our own desert. For he best <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> himself, who accounts himself to be nothing. Thus we see that both David and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, when they had come up to the highest pitch of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, then best fulfilled this; and would call themselves, the one, <q>earth and ashes,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen018.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 18:27</font></u></a></span> the other, <q>a worm;</q> and all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> too, like these, acknowledge their own wretchedness. So that he surely who is lifted up in boasting, is the very person to be most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of himself. Wherefore also in our common practice we are wont to say of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proud</font></u></a>, <q>he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not himself,</q> <q>he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of himself.</q> And he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not himself, whom will he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>? For as he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> himself will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> all things, so he who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not this, neither will he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the rest.</p>
<p>Such an one was he that says, <q>I will exalt my throne above the Heavens.</q> and did not account himself to be worthy so much as of the title of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, after so many and so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of goodness.</p>
<p>Him therefore let us emulate and follow. And we shall follow him, if we rid ourselves of earth, and of things on earth. For nothing makes a man to be so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of himself, as the being rivetted to worldly concerns: nor does anything again so much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> men to be rivetted to worldly concerns, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> of one's self: for these things depend upon each other. I mean, that as he that is fond of outward <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and highly esteems the things present, if he strive for ever, is not permitted to understand himself; so he that overlooks these things will easily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> himself; and having come to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of himself, he will proceed in order to all the other parts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>In order therefore that we may learn this good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, let us, disengaged from all the perishable things that kindle in us so great flame, and made aware of their vileness, show forth all lowliness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and self-restraint: that we may attain unto blessings, both present and future: by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the Holy and Good Spirit, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

Gregory comments on the parable of the wedding banquet all the way through, but
he insists more on the wedding gown and Jesus' final sentence: "Many are
called, but few are chosen."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I- (1-8)
Without wishing to impose his opinion, the pope leans for the distinction
between the banquet of the wedding of our gospel and the supper of which St.
Luke speaks (14, 16-24: commented passage in Homily 36). The latter would then
represent eternity, while the other banquet designates the present Church, from
which one can still exclude an unworthy one, not wearing the nuptial habit. The
speaker demonstrates that the Church of the Earth can be called the Kingdom of
Heaven, and then he determines successively the marriage, the refusal of the
guests, and the punishment inflicted upon them by the king. Good and bad are
found in the wedding hall, because here the good ones must be resolved to this inextricable
mixture where the bad ones dominate. Like the ark of Noah, which is closing up,
the Church has many sinners and few perfect ones. Yet the wicked are useful to
the good ones, that they make them even better.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">II- (9-13)
We must be careful to wear the wedding dress, which is charity. The preacher
expresses in two images that this charity must include the love of God and the
love of neighbor. It is according to God, he adds, that we are bound to love
our neighbor, of which we are more easily certain when it comes to enemies,
whom we can only love in God. Every excuse will fall when the Judge appears:
the feet and hands already tied invisibly by sin, we will be thrown into the
outer darkness, which corresponds to our inner blindness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">III-
(14-16) For "many are called, but few are chosen." Unable to know if
we will be elected, we are invited to humble ourselves. Gregory, knowing the
examples more effective than the words, relates two exciting stories,
complementary to each other. Three of his aunts had joined together in a life
of chastity. Two of them progressed to death, but the last did not persevere
and married. Conversely, the pope then tells, a very corrupt young man, just
converting when he was going to die, stay alive and indulge in penance. Thus, a
holy nun perverts herself and ends up damning herself, while a hardened sinner
converts in extremis. Let us therefore tremble for the imperfection of our
actions, and let us rejoice only in the mercy of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

time Jesus spoke in parables to the chief priests and Pharisees, saying,
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding for his son. He
sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, and they
would not come. And he sent other servants, saying, "Say to the guests,
Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my bulls and my fat poultry are
slaughtered; everything is ready, come to the wedding. "But these did not
take it into account and went away, one to his field, the other to his
business. Some even seized the servants, and after mistreating them, they
killed them. The king, having heard of it, became angry and sent his armies; he
killed those assassins and burned their city. Then he said to his servants,
"The wedding meal is ready, but those I invited were not worthy. Go
therefore to the end of the ways, and all those whom you find, invite them to
the wedding.&gt; These servants, gone out on the roads, gathered together all
those whom they found, bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with
guests.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

king came in to see those who were at the table, and seeing a man there who was
not wearing the nuptial dress, he said to him, 'My friend, how did you come in

said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him into outer
darkness. There will be crying and gnashing of teeth.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">My plan,
my dear brothers, is to go through briefly, if I can, the text of this gospel, to
have the time to expand my remarks at the end. But we must first of all find
out if the story [of the banquet] we read in Matthew's Gospel coincides with
that of Luke, who speaks of a supper. There certainly seem to be some
differences between the two, because here we mention a lunch, and there, a
supper. In the first text, the one who entered the wedding without an
appropriate garment was expelled, while in the other, it is not said that none
of those who entered was expelled. We can safely conclude that in today's
narration the nuptials represent the Church of the earth, while in the other
narrative, supper is the final banquet of eternity. In fact, if some of them
come out of the first banquet after having entered it, whoever enters the
second banquet will not come out again.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But if
someone would absolutely insist that here and there is the same passage of the
Gospel, I prefer, since faith is not in question, to surrender to the opinion
of others than to have to arguing with him, because one can no doubt admit that
Matthew speaks of this man expelled for having entered without a wedding
garment, and that Luke does not speak of it. Even the fact that one speaks of a
supper and the other of a lunch does not contradict our way of understanding,
because the lunch was still taking place at the elders at the ninth hour and
could therefore also be called a supper.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. I
remember telling you many times that it is often the Church of the earth that
is called the Kingdom of Heaven in the Holy Gospel. Indeed, we designate the
assembly of the just under the name of the Kingdom of Heaven. And since the
Lord declares through the voice of the prophet that "heaven is his
throne" (Is 66: 1), that Solomon affirms that the soul of the righteous is
the throne of Wisdom (cf Sg 7: 27-28) and that Paul says that "Christ is
the power of God and the wisdom of God" (1 Cor 1: 24), we must conclude
with confidence that God being the Wisdom and the soul of the righteous the
throne of Wisdom, The soul of the righteous is indeed a heaven, since heaven is
called the throne of God. Hence this word of the psalmist concerning the holy
preachers: "The heavens declare the glory of God" (Ps 19: 2). The
kingdom of heaven is therefore the Church of the righteous, for they desiring
nothing on earth and sighing toward things above, the Lord already reigns in
them as in heaven.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Our text
can therefore say, "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a
wedding for his son."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. Your
charity fully understands who this king is, father of a son who is king too; it
is he to whom the psalmist says: "O God, give judgment to the king, and
your righteousness to the king's son." (Ps 72: 1)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"He
made a wedding for his son." God the Father made a marriage for God, his
Son, when he united human nature with him in the womb of the Virgin, and when
he wanted him who was God before the centuries to become man to the end of the
centuries. But it is not because the marital union is normally done from two
persons, that we can admit the idea that the person of Jesus Christ, our
Redeemer, God and man, results from the union of two people. We say that it is
of two natures and subsists in two natures, but we keep ourselves, as from a
blasphemy, to believe it composed of two persons.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
therefore clearer and more certain to say that the Father made a wedding for
the King, his Son, by associating him with the Holy Church by the mystery of
the Incarnation. The breast of the Virgin Mother was the nuptial bed of this
Bridegroom. So the psalmist says: "He has pitched his tent in the sun; and
he is like the bridegroom coming out of the nuptial chamber "(Ps 19: 5-6).
The incarnate God indeed came out as a husband of the nuptial chamber, leaving
the unaltered breast of the Virgin to unite with the Church.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He sent
his servants to invite his friends to such nuptials. He sent them a first, then
a second time, because to announce the Incarnation of the Lord, he first used
prophets, then apostles. He therefore sent his servants to invite [his friends]
twice, since he announced by the prophets that the Incarnation of his
only-begotten Son was going to be realized, and that once realized, he made it
known by the apostles.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But
because those who had been the first guests did not want to come to the banquet
of the wedding, the king sends to say by a second invitation: "Behold, I
have prepared my feast; my bulls and my fat poultry are slaughtered; everything
is ready."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. What
are we to see, dear brothers, in bulls and fat fowls, if not the Fathers of the
Old and New Testaments? As I speak to the people, they are the very words of
our gospel that I am obliged to explain. We call "well fed" [altilia]
the animals that have been fattened: because the Latin origin is the verb to
nourish [alere], we say "well-nourished" [altilia or alitilia] .1</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Because it
is written in the Law, "You shall love your friend (Lv 19:18), and you
will hate your enemy" (Mt 5:43), the righteous were allowed to crush with
all their force their enemies and those of God, and even kill them by the sword
without injustice; permission which is undoubtedly removed by the New
Testament, when the Truth in person preaches to us in these terms: "Love
your enemies, do good to those who hate you" (Mt 5:44). What do bulls, if
not the Old Testament fathers, symbolize? Indeed, since the law had allowed
them to strike their adversaries in revenge for the hatred [that they showed], were
they not, so to speak, bulls, when they hit their enemies with horns, using
their physical strength?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And what
about the fat poultry, if not the New Testament Fathers? When they receive the
divine gift of a very rich inner food, emerging from their earthly desires,
they are raised to the summits by the wings of their contemplation. To apply
one's thoughts to things below, is it not a certain dryness of the mind? But
those whose holy desires already feed on the goods from above, savoring them
internally through meditation on the things of Heaven, nourish themselves, so
to speak, handsomely on a more copious food. It is this fat that the prophet
desired to gorge himself when he said: "My soul be satisfied like marrow
and fat." (Ps 63, 6)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Thus,
since the preachers sent to announce the Incarnation of the Lord, the prophets
first, then the holy apostles, were persecuted by the infidels, the king sent
word to those who were invited but who did not want to come: "My bulls and
my fat poultry are slaughtered; Everything is ready. "It is as if he were
telling them more clearly:" Consider the death of the Fathers who have
preceded us, and think of a remedy for the corruption of your life. "
There is no question of bulls and fat poultry at the first invitation, while
they are declared slain at the second invitation. The Almighty God indeed adds
examples to his words when we do not want to listen to them: to learn that
others have already gone through the same difficulties gives us better hope of
achieving what we consider impossible.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. The
text continues: "But they did not take it into account and went away, one
to his field, the other to his business." To go to his field, is to
indulge in excess to the work of the earth. Going to trading is avidly coveting
the profit that is collected from the activities of the century. That one is
too attentive to the works of the earth and the other too absorbed by the
activities of this world, it prevents them from meditating on the mystery of
the Incarnation of the Lord and living in harmony with him; Is it not, so to
speak, to refuse to come to the King's wedding, by going to his field or his
business? And often, what is more serious, there are some who are not content
to reject the grace of the God who calls them, but persecutes [those who announce
it to him]. Hence the rest of the text: "Some even seized the servants,
and after mistreating them, they killed them. The king, having learned it, sent
his armies; he slew these assassins and burned their city. "He kills the
assassins, since he kills the persecutors. He burns their city with fire, for
it is not only their souls, but also the flesh in which they dwelt, which is
tortured by the eternal flames of hell.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
specified that the killings were exterminated by the armies sent against them.
Indeed, God's judgment towards men is always manifested through the angels. And
what are the angels' troops, if not the armies of our King? So this same King
is called the Lord Sabaoth, Sabaoth meaning "armies". The Lord
therefore sends an army to destroy his enemies, since he exerts his vengeance
through his angels. The power of this vengeance, our fathers heard about it;
but we now have it in front of us. Where are the men of pride who persecuted
the martyrs? Where are those who, in their heart, raised their necks against
their Creator and swelled the murderous glory of this world? The death of the
martyrs now flourished in the faith of the living, while those who boasted of
their cruelty to them no longer come to our memory, even among the dead. So we
actually see what we hear in parables.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. But the
king who sees his despised invitation will not leave empty the wedding hall of
his son's king. He sends his servants to other people, because even if the word
of God suffers from difficulties with some, it will eventually find a place to
rest. Hence the rest of the text: "Then he said to his servants," The
wedding meal is ready, but those I invited to it were not worthy. Go then to
the end of the ways, and all those which you will find, invite them to the
nuptials. »» If in Scripture, the paths designate the actions, should not one
understand by the issue of the paths the actions that fail? For it is often
those who have failed in the actions of the earth who come more easily to God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. The
text goes on: "These servants went out on the roads and gathered together
all those whom they found, bad and good; and the wedding hall was full of
guests. "The precision here in the quality of the guests now makes it
clear that the King's wedding symbolizes the Church of the earth, where the bad
ones join the good ones. The Church sees very different sons in her womb, for
if she begets them all to the faith, the faults of some of them forbid her to
lead them all to the spiritual grace which would make them free, lifestyle change.
As long as we live here, we can not avoid going through the path of life
present in this inextricable mixture [of bad and good ones]. It is on arrival
that we will be separated. The good ones are alone nowhere except in Heaven,
and the bad ones are alone nowhere except in hell. And since the present life,
situated between Heaven and Hell, constitutes a middle ground between the two,
it welcomes together the citizens of both camps. However, if the holy Church
now receives them without distinction, she will separate them afterwards when
they come out of life.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">If you are
good, then bear the bad ones with patience as long as you remain in this life.
For he who does not want to endure the wicked himself testifies that he is not
good. He refuses to be an Abel, the one who does not accept that Cain torments
him with his wickedness. Is not the grain of wheat hiding under the straw when
it is thrown on the threshing floor? Is not the flower born in the midst of
thorns? Does not the fragrant rose grow with the pungent spine? The first man
had two sons: one was elected, the other reprobate (see Gen 4: 1-5). Three sons
were in the ark of Noah: two of them were elected, the third reprobate (see Gen
9: 25-27). Abraham had two sons: one was elected, the other reprobate (see Gen
21: 10). Isaac had two sons: one was elected, the other reprobate (see Gn
27:37). Jacob had twelve sons: of these, one owed his innocence to be sold, the
others had the mischief to be the salesmen of their brother (see Gn 37:28).
Twelve apostles were chosen, but one of them [Judas], who put the others to the
test, was mixed up with the Eleven, who were tested by him (Acts 1: 16-17).
Seven deacons were ordained by these apostles (Acts 6: 5): six remained
faithful to their faith, one was a source of error. So can there be in this
Church of the earth, wicked without good, nor good without wicked. Remember,
dear brothers, past times, and strengthen yourself to bear the wicked. For if
we are the sons of the elect, we must necessarily follow their example. And no
one was good without accepting to endure the wicked. On this subject, Blessed
Job says of himself: "I was the brother of the dragons, the companion of
ostriches" (Jb 30, 29). And by Solomon, the voice of the Bridegroom said
to the Holy Church, "Like a lily in the midst of thorns, as my friend
among young women." (Ct 2, 2). The Lord also declares to Ezekiel,
"Son of man, unbelievers and rebels are with you, and you dwell with
scorpions" (Ez 2: 6). And Peter glorifies in this sense the life of the
blessed Lot, when he says: "And he delivered the just Lot afflicted by the
unjust conduct of these scoundrels, because because of what he saw and heard,
this just, continuing to live among them, had every day his virtuous soul
tortured by their unjust deeds. "(2P 2, 7-8). Paul praises and encourages
the lives of the disciples in the same sense, saying, "In the midst of
this perverse and corrupt people, in whose breast you shine like torches in the
world, cling to the word of life." Ph 2, 15-16). John also testifies to
the Church of Pergamum with these words: "I know where you live: where
satan's seat is; but you are firmly attached to my name, and you have not
denied my faith "(Rev 2: 13). See, dear brothers, as we go through the
Scriptures, we find almost everywhere that no one was good without having been
put to the test by the disturbances of the wicked. It can be said, by way of
comparison, that the iron of our soul does not reach the finesse of a good
cutting edge without the lashings inflicted on it by the disturbances of
others.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. You
must not be afraid that there are many wicked and few good in the church, for
the ark carried on the waters of the flood, which was the figure of the Church
of the earth, was wide. in its lower part and narrow in its upper part,
narrowing even at the top up to the width of a cubit (see Gn 6, 15). It must be
supposed that the lower part contained the quadrupeds and the reptiles, the
superior the birds and the men. It is wide down to contain the animals, narrow
at the top to keep the men, since the holy Church is vast in its carnal part,
narrow in its spiritual part. She widens her breast even more where she has to
tolerate the kind of bestial life of men. Whereas where it contains men who
live a spiritual way of life, it probably touches the summit, but it becomes
narrower, because such men are few. "Broad, indeed, is the way to
perdition, and many are following it. Narrow is the one that leads to life, and
there are few who find it. "(Mt 7:13)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The ark
narrows at the top to the extent of one cubit, since in the holy Church, the
more the souls are holy, the fewer they are, and that this Church finds its
crowning in the only Man among the other men to to be born holy (cf Lk 1, 35),
the one to whom no one else can be compared. About him, the psalmist says,
"He became like a lonely sparrow on a roof" (Ps 102, 8). It is
therefore better to bear the wicked they are more numerous, because we also
find on the threshing floor only a few grains to be raked, while there are
heaps of straw to burn in the fire.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">9. But
since you owe to the bounties of the Lord to have already entered the house of
the wedding, that is to say in the holy Church, take care, my brothers, that
the King, on entering, find nothing blamable in the habit of your soul. Indeed,
we must consider with great fear what the text adds immediately after: "The
king entered to see those who were at the table, and there he saw a man who was
not wearing the nuptial dress." What symbolism Shall we attribute, dear
brothers, to this nuptial dress? Shall we say that it represents baptism, or
faith? But who could have entered the wedding hall without baptism or faith?
For he who has not yet believed is by the very fact outside [of the Church].
What must we understand by the nuptial dress, if not the charity? He indeed
enters for the wedding, but he enters without the nuptial robe, the one who is
in the holy Church and has faith, but lacks charity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is with
good reason that charity is called a wedding dress, since our Creator wore it
when it came to the wedding to unite with the Church. Is it not by virtue of
his only love that God sent his only Son to unite the souls of the elect? Hence
the word of John: "God so loved the world that he gave us his only
Son" (Jn 3:16). He who came to men out of love made it known that his love
is the nuptial dress.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">All of you
who belong to the Church and believe in God have already entered the wedding
hall, but if they did not keep the grace of charity, they did not come with the
bridal dress. Surely, my brethren, if anyone were invited to a human wedding,
he would change his clothes and manifest by the very beauty of his clothes that
he will rejoice with the bridegroom and the bride; he would blush to show
himself with neglected clothes among the jubilant people celebrating this
feast. And we who go to the wedding of God, we do not care to change the
garment of our soul! Angels rejoice together when the elect ascend to heaven.
In what state of mind do we then approach these spiritual feasts, we who do not
wear the wedding dress that is charity, when it alone makes us look beautiful?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">10. We
must know that as we weave the garments in two directions, namely the warp and
weft, so charity is based on two precepts, the love of God and the love of
neighbor. It is written in effect: "You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength, and your
neighbor as yourself" (Mk 12: 30-31). We must note here that the Lord puts
a measure to the love of the neighbor when he indicates to us: "You will
love your neighbor as yourself", but that it does not set limits to the
love of God, since He says to us, "You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength." For this
precept does not regulate the measure of our love, but from what depth it must
go when it tells us "everything". To love God really is to keep
nothing for oneself from what is yours.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Whoever
takes care of having the bridal gown for the wedding is therefore bound to
observe these two precepts of charity. For this reason, according to the
prophet Ezekiel, the vestibule of the gate of the city established on the
mountain measures two cubits (see Ez 40,9); for the access of the heavenly city
is open to us only if we keep good the love of God and neighbor in this Church
of the earth, called vestibule of Heaven because it is still external to it. It
is for the same reason that it is prescribed to dye the tabernacle curtains
twice in scarlet (see Ex 26: 1). It is you, brothers, yes, it is you who are
the hangings of the Tabernacle, because by faith, you are veiling the secrets
of Heaven in your hearts. But for the tabernacle hangings a fabric dyed twice
with scarlet must be used. Now scarlet has the appearance of fire. And what is
charity, if not a fire? But this charity must be dyed twice, once by the love
of God, another by the love of neighbor. For he who loves God, but neglects his
neighbor to indulge in contemplation, is no doubt dyed scarlet, but not twice.
On the other hand, he who loves his neighbor but forgets for his sake the
contemplation of God, is well dyed with scarlet, but not twice. So that your
charity may be dyed twice in scarlet, it must ignite, and the love of God, and
love of neighbor; it must neither abandon the contemplation of God out of
compassion for the neighbor, nor neglect the compassion for the neighbor by too
much attachment to the contemplation of God. Thus, every man living among men
must aspire to the one he desires without, however, losing interest in the one
with whom he is running; and he must assist his neighbor without at all slowing
down the race by which he hastens to God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">11. It is
also necessary to know that the love of the neighbor has two precepts himself,
since a sage tells us: "What you would be angry at being done, take care
not to do it to another" ( Tb 4:15), and that the Truth in person preaches
to us in these terms: "Whatever you want men to do to you, do it for them
also" (Mt 7:12). Indeed, we fully respect our duties of charity if while
giving others what we rightly want to be provided, we avoid doing what we do
not want us to do.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But let no
one think too quickly of having charity because one loves someone, if one has
not at first examined the very value of the love one has for him. For to love a
person without loving him because of God is not to have charity, but only to imagine
that one has it. True charity consists in loving one's friends in God, and
one's enemies for God's sake. Indeed, to know how to love who does not love you
is to love God because of those we love: charity is usually proven only in the
face of hostility and hatred. Hence the word of the Lord himself: "Love
your enemies; do good to those who hate you "(Lk 6:27). He is certain to
love, who loves God because of whom he knows not to be loved.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">That all
this is great, that all this is high and difficult to practice for many! But
that's it, the wedding dress. It is highly to be feared, for those who have sat
down at the wedding without having dressed it, that one day, when the King
comes to enter, he will not be thrown out. For this is what is said: "The
king entered the marriage hall to see those who were at the table, and there he
saw a man who was not wearing the nuptial robe." It is we, dear brothers
who are seated at the wedding of the Word, we who have faith and we find in the
Church, we who are nourished by the Holy Scriptures and we rejoice to be the
Church united to God. Consider, I conjure you, if you have come to this
marriage-bearing wedding; make a careful and careful examination of your
thoughts. Examine your hearts on each of the following points: if you have no
hate against anyone, if the fire of envy does not ignite you against the
happiness of another, if a secret malice does not push you to try to harm to
someone.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">12.
Behold, the King enters for the wedding, and considers the garment of our heart.
To him whom he does not see clothed with charity, he asks angrily, "My
friend, how did you come here without having the wedding dress?" It is
quite astonishing, dear brothers, that while calling this man his friend, he
condemns him. It is as if he were telling her more clearly: "You are my
friend, and you are not my friend: you are my friend by faith, but you are not
my friend by works."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

man remained silent ", because - it can not be said without groaning -
before the rigor of the final punishment, all excuse falls of itself, since the
one who, outside, bursts out in reproach against the soul is the even who, on

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We must
know here that he who has put on this garment of virtue, although still
imperfectly, must not despair of forgiveness at the arrival of the King full of
goodness, for he himself has given us hope by this word. of the psalmist:

teeth. "Then we bind the hands and feet, by a rigorous sentence, to those
who have not wanted to be bound until then by abstaining from their evil works,
by amendment of their life. It can also be said that the penalty then binds
those whom sin had hitherto bound by keeping them away from good works. For the
feet which neglect to visit the sick, the hands which give nothing to the
needy, have bound themselves by their will, by departing from good works. Thus,
those who bind themselves here voluntarily in vice will then be bound against

fitting that the king orders the man without the bridal gown to be cast into
the outer darkness. In fact, the inner darkness signifies the blindness of the
heart, and the outer darkness, the eternal night of damnation. The damned is
not thrown into the inner darkness, but into the outer darkness, because one
throws down there against his will in the night of damnation the one who fell
down here of his own free will in the darkness. blindness of the heart. There,
we are told, are the weeping and gnashing of teeth: there grind the teeth that
put down here their enjoyment to eat; there mourn the eyes which were devoted
here below to forbidden desires. Thus each of the members of the body is
subjected to a torment, since each of them had submitted to a vice here below.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

soon as the man who represents all the wicked has been expelled, the text ends
with a general sentence: "For many are called, but few are chosen."
What we hear here, dear brothers, is quite scary. By faith we have all been
called to come to the wedding of the Heavenly King, we believe in the mystery
of his Incarnation and we profess it, we take part in the banquet of the divine
Word; but behold, in the day of judgment, the King of righteousness shall come
in. We know that we are called, but we do not know if we are elected. Each of
us must therefore humble ourselves all the more deeply as he does not know if
he is elected. Indeed, there are some who do not even begin to do good; others,
which have started well, do not persevere. One leads a disorderly existence for
most of his life, but returns shortly before the end of his life by the tears
of severe penance; another leads a life of elected, and yet comes to go astray
in the evil shortly before the end of his life. One begins his life well, and
finishes better still; another throws himself headlong into evil from his
earliest youth, and dies after never ceasing to become worse in the same
disturbances. Everyone must therefore fear for himself with all the more
anxiety because he does not know how much time he has left; for it is something
that must be repeated often, without ever forgetting it: "Many are called,
but few are elected."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

since to convert the minds of the hearers, the examples of other Christians are
often more effective than the words of those who teach them, I want to tell you
what happened to someone close to us. Your hearts will hear it with all the
more fear that it is a person closer to us. Because we do not tell here very
old facts, but we report to you of which the witnesses are still alive to
testify to us that they attended there.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">My father
had three sisters, all three consecrated virgins. One was called Tarsilla, the
other Gordiana, the third Æmiliana. All three, entered into religion with the
same ardor and consecrated at the same time, had given themselves a very strict
rule and led the common life in their own house. As they had been in this kind
of life for a long time, Tarsilla and Imiliana began to grow from day to day in
the love of their Creator: only their bodies remained here below, while their
souls passed each day a little more towards eternal goods. The soul of
Gordiana, on the contrary, began to let the love of the inner life cool down
from day to day, to return little by little to the love of this world. Tarsilla
often said to her sister Æmiliana, crying a lot: "I see that our sister
Gordiana does not live in harmony with us; I must admit that she lets herself
go to things outside, and that her heart does not keep what she had proposed.
"The two sisters took care to correct Gordiana every day with tender
remonstrances, to make her to return from his lightness of manners to the
gravity which suited his dress. The latter no doubt took on a serious face when
she was reprimanded, but as soon as the hour of the reprimand passed, the
virtue of gravity that we wanted to impose on her also passed, and Gordiana
returned to the same lightness of speech. . She enjoyed herself in the society
of the young girls of the world, and the company of those who were not worldly
weighed on her.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Better
than her sisters, my aunt Tarsilla had risen to the honor of the highest
sanctity by her continual prayer, her application to mortify herself, her
unusual abstinence, and the gravity of her venerable life. Now, one night, as
she herself said, my ancestor Felix, who was bishop of this Church of Rome,
appeared to him in a vision and showed him the abode of eternal light, saying,
"Come because I will receive you in this light. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Soon,
seized by fever, she arrived on her last day. And when, when a noble woman or
man dies, many people gather to comfort their loved ones, at the time of my
aunt's death, men and women flocked around her bed; my mother was there too.
Tarsilla suddenly raised her eyes, and seeing Jesus coming, she began to shout
to those around her, in a tone of sharp reproach: "Go! Go! Jesus is
coming. "And while his gaze was drawn toward the one she saw, his holy soul
left his body. Immediately was spread a perfume so wonderful that it appeared
to everyone by this delicious smell that the Author of all delights had come
there. When the body of Tarsilla was undressed for washing, as is customary for
the dead, it was found that the skin was hardened on the elbows and knees, like
that of a camel, as a result of his long prayers. What his soul had done
throughout his life, his flesh testified after his death.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">All these
events took place before the Nativity of the Lord. The feast having passed,
Tarsilla soon appeared in vision to her sister Æmiliana during the night, and
she said to him: "Come! I already had to celebrate Christmas without you,
now I would like to celebrate Epiphany with you. "Ilmiliana, who cared
about the safety of her sister Gordiana, answered immediately:" If I come
alone, to whom will I entrust our Sister Gordiana? "But to her objection,
Tarsilla sadly repeated," Come on, for our sister Gordiana is destined to
take her place among the women of the world. "Illness soon followed that
vision and made such progress that Imiliana died before the Epiphany of the
Lord, as he had been told. As for Gordiana, as soon as she found herself alone,
her vices increased, and the evil hitherto hidden in the depths of her bad
desires now appeared in the disorder of her actions. In defiance of the fear of
the Lord, in defiance of all modesty and self-respect, in defiance at last of
her consecration, she later married the farmer of his lands.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">See these
three sisters: they had consecrated themselves to God in the same movement of
fervor, but they did not remain animated by one and the same zeal. Because,
according to the word of the Lord, "many are called, but few are
chosen." I have told you these things so that those who now do good works
do not take credit for it and do not trust in their actions. Because if they
know today what they are, they still do not know what they will be tomorrow. No
one, therefore, must rejoice from his good works from now on as if he were sure
of it: as long as he remains among the vagaries of this life, he does not know
how he will end.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But having
told you this story, which has given you to fear the severity of God, I will
tell you another, which concerns me closely, and in which the example of his mercy
will comfort your frightened hearts. I remember having already said it in
another sermon4, but you, you were not there.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">16. Less
than two years ago, a brother came to lead religious life in my monastery near
the Church of Blessed Martyrs John and Paul. It was finally received after the
long delay imposed by the Rule. His brother followed him to this monastery, not
for the sake of religious life, but for his fraternal affection. He who came to
lead the religious life was very agreeable to the monks; his brother, on the
other hand, was far removed from his life and manners. He lived, however, at
the monastery, but rather by necessity than by a voluntary choice. And although
he was corrupt in all his actions, all supported him with patience for his
brother's sake. He was light in his words, depraved in his actions, searched in
his clothes, rude in his manners, and could not bear being told to live under
the monastic habit. His life had become painful to see for all the brethren,
but yet all, as I said, supported him for the sake of his brother. He roughly
repulsed the one who spoke to him to reform his bad behavior. Not only could he
not do good, but he could not even hear about it. He protested, with strong
swear words, fits of anger and sneers, that he would never accept to take the
habit of monastic life.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">However,
during the plague epidemic that devoured a large part of the population of this
city [of Rome], a groin tumor quickly dragged him to death. When he was about
to die, the brothers came together to protect his end with their prayers. His
body was already dead in his extremities, and he kept only a little vital heat
in his chest. All the brothers began to pray for him all the more urgently as
they saw him already leaving quickly. He suddenly screamed as loudly as he
could, interrupting with great clamor the prayers of the brothers around him:
"Get away! Withdraw! Here I have been fed to the dragon. Your presence
alone prevents him from devouring me; my head is already in his mouth. Move
away, so that he does not torture me more, but does what he has to do. If I
have been given to him for food, why do I have to wait because of you?
"Then the brothers began to say to him," What are you talking about
here, brother? Make the sign of the holy cross on you. "He answered as he
could:" I want to sign myself, but I can not, because the dragon crushes
me. "On hearing this, the brothers prostrated themselves on the ground,
and all in tears, they began to pray with even more fervor for his deliverance.
And suddenly the patient began to get better and to express his joy as much as
he could, saying: "God be praised! The dragon who had received me in
pasture is on the run. Your prayers chased him away, and he could not stay.
Intercede now for my sins, for I am ready to convert and completely give up the
life of the world. "Thus, this man who had, as I said before, almost dead
body extremities, was brought back to life and he converts to God with all his
heart. Finding himself instructed by long and continual sufferings in this new
life, and his illness becoming worse, he died a few days later. But when he
died, he did not see the devil again, because he had conquered him by the
transformation of his heart.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">See, my
brethren, how this Gordiana, of which I spoke to you just now, has fallen from
the heights of the holy habit of a nun to the point of torture; see also how
the brother whose life I have just told you has come up from the gates of death
to eternal life. Nobody can therefore know what is happening to him in the secret
judgments of God, because "many are called, but few are elected".
Thus, since no one can be certain of being elected, all must tremble and fear
for the imperfection of their actions, and put their joy in the only divine
mercy, without ever presuming of their own strength. He will crown our
confidence, the one who has deigned to assume our human nature, Jesus Christ,
who, being God, lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

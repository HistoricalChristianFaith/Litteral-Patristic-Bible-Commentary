</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">A week
after her feast, a second mention of St. Agnes, a virgin and martyr, was made
in Rome. It is difficult to determine whether this was an ancient octave, or
whether it commemorated an apparition of the saint revealing her glory to her
parents. In any case, this fact, unique in the calendar, reveals the extreme
popularity that the little saint had won from the beginning.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is on
this second feast that St. Gregory explains the parable of the ten virgins.
Five of them were foolish, and did not take oil in the vases of their lamps.
This oil shortage is interpreted by the preacher with great subtlety. The
bridegroom comes, who is the sovereign Judge, and the gate of Heaven is closed
to the foolish virgins. Too late: the time of penance has passed!
"Watch," said Jesus, "for you know neither the day nor the
hour." Indeed, Gregory adds, he who promised forgiveness to the penitent
did not promise a morrow to the sinner. And in his desire to inculcate this
truth with more force, the holy pope recounts the terrifying death of the rich
Chrysaorius. This story is the first of those that will now quite often
illustrate the homilies. Such a narrative dispenses the preacher from
insisting, and it is deeply engraved in the memories of the listeners.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">At that
time, Jesus told his disciples this parable: "The kingdom of heaven is
like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom and
the bride. Five of them were crazy, and five were wise. The five lunatics,
having taken their lamps, carried no oil; but the wise took oil in their vases
with the lamps. As the husband was slow to come, they all fell asleep and fell
asleep. In the middle of the night, a cry was heard: "Behold, the
bridegroom who comes, go out to meet him." Then all these virgins arose
and prepared their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us of your
oil, because our lamps are extinguished." The sages answered, "Lest
there be not enough for us and for you, go instead to merchants and buy them
for you. "But while they went to buy them, the bridegroom came, and those
who were ready entered with him into the wedding-hall, and the door was shut.
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to
us." But this one answered, "Truly, I say to you, I do not know
you."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Watch,
then, because you do not know the day or the hour."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
often, dear brothers, that I exhort you to flee the evil works and to avoid the
defilements of this world. But today, reading the Holy Gospel makes it my duty
to invite you to great vigilance even in your good deeds, lest you seek the
favor or recognition of men for what you do well, and that the desire of
praise, by slipping into it, deprives an inner reward of what you make appear
on the outside. Here indeed our Redeemer speaks to us of ten virgins. Now, if
he names them all virgins, yet he does not let them all go through the door of
bliss, because some of them, looking outside for glory for their virginity, did
not want to keep oil in their vases.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But we
must begin by asking ourselves what the Kingdom of Heaven is, and why we
compare it to ten virgins, some of whom are wise, and the other foolish. Since
it is clear that no reprobate enters the kingdom of heaven, why declare this
kingdom like wild virgins? We must know that in Holy Scripture the Church of
the present time is often called the Kingdom of Heaven. The Lord thus says in
another place: "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove
from his kingdom all scandals" (Mt 13:41). But it is not in the Kingdom of
Bliss, where peace is perfect, that they can find scandals to be removed. It is
in this sense that it is said elsewhere: "Whoever breaks one of these
least commandments and teaches men to do the same, he will be called the least
in the Kingdom of Heaven. . But whoever has practiced and taught them, he shall
be called great in the kingdom of heaven "(Mt 5:19). To break a
commandment and to teach it is not to practice in one's life what is preached
by one's mouth. But whoever does not want to practice what he teaches can not
reach the Kingdom of eternal bliss. How, then, will he be called the smallest,
if he is not allowed to enter it? Therefore, it is the Church of the earth that
is called the Kingdom of Heaven in the words of the Lord. In this Church, the
doctor who violates a command is called the smallest, because there is little
case of the preaching of a man whose life is despised.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We all
live in a body endowed with five senses. If we double this number five, we get
ten. And since the multitude of the faithful is made up of people of both
sexes, the holy Church is compared to ten virgins. As, in this Church, the
wicked mingle with the good and the reprobate with the elect, it is legitimate
to compare it to virgins, some of whom are wise, and the other foolish. Indeed,
there is no shortage of chaste persons who do not want the external things:
driven by the hope of the inner goods, they mortify their flesh, aspire from
all their desires for the heavenly homeland, wait for the eternal rewards and
do not want not receive human praise for their labors. Such people do not put
their glory in the mouths of men, but hide it in the most intimate part of
their consciousness. But there are many others who, while afflicting their
bodies with abstinence, seek the favors of men for this abstinence. They are
assiduous to the instructions and give liberally to the needy; but they are
certainly foolish virgins, because they seek only the reward of an ephemeral
praise.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This is
why the Gospel rightly adds: "The five lunatics, having taken their lamps,
did not carry oil; but the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.
"Oil means the brightness of glory; the vases are our hearts, in which we
carry all our thoughts. The wise virgins thus have oil in their vessels, since
they retain in their consciences all the brilliance of glory, as Paul
testifies: "What makes our glory is the testimony of our conscience. (2
Cor 1, 12). But foolish virgins do not carry oil, because they do not place
their glory in the [testimony of] their conscience, because they ask it to the
praise of others. Note: all have lamps, but all have no oil. It is because the
reprobates often produce good deeds like the elect, but only those who seek to
derive from their external actions an interior glory meet the Bridegroom with
oil. It is in the same sense that the psalmist declares, speaking of the holy
Church of the elect: "All the glory of the king's daughter comes to him
from within" (Ps 45, 15).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2.
"As the bridegroom was slow to come, they all fell asleep and fell
asleep": while the Judge returns his coming for the last judgment, elected
and reprobate fall asleep of death. Here, in fact, to fall asleep is to die. To
fall asleep before falling asleep is to fall sick before dying; because the
weight of the disease leads us to the sleep of death.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3.
"In the middle of the night a cry was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom who
cometh, go out to meet him.'" It is in the middle of the night that the
cry announcing the arrival of the Bridegroom, since the day of the judgment
occurs without it being possible to foresee it. This is why it is written,
"The day of the Lord will come at night as a thief." (1 Thess 5: 2).
Then all the virgins get up, because elected and reprobate are drawn from the sleep
of death. The virgins garnish their lamps, that is to say that each one is
counting for himself the works for which he hopes to receive eternal bliss. But
the lamps of the foolish virgins are extinguished, for their works, which
outside have appeared so striking to men, darken from within at the arrival of
the Judge. And these foolish virgins do not obtain from God any reward for what
has already earned them the praises they loved from men. Why do they ask the
wise virgins for oil, if not because, recognizing the Judge's coming of their
emptiness, they seek an external testimony? It is as if, returning from their
self-assurance, they said to their loved ones, "Since you see us rejected
as if we had done nothing, say what you have seen of our good works."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But the
wise virgins answer, "Lest there be not enough for us and for you."
For if in the day of judgment - and here I speak of those who rest in peace
with the Church - barely the testimony that he gives himself to himself can
suffice for everyone, how much less he could for himself and for his neighbor.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">So wise
virgins immediately add, in a reproachful way: "Go to the merchants and
buy them for yourself." The oil merchants are the flatterers. Indeed,
those who, by their vain praises, offer some glory to the slightest benefit
received, look like oil merchants, of that oil which the psalmist declares:
"The sinner's oil will not overgrow my head "(Ps 141: 5). It's the
head at home that dominates. So we give the head's name to the mind that dominates
the body. The oil of the sinner therefore fattens our head, when the incense of
the flatterer caresses our mind.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"But
while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came." For while they ask

"Those who were ready entered with him into the wedding hall, and the door
was shut." Oh! if it were possible to taste with the palate of the heart!
As we marvel at these words: "The bridegroom came"! What sweetness
one would find in these others: "They entered with him at the
wedding!" And what bitterness in these last ones: "And the door was
closed!"</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He comes,
the one whose coming shakes the elements, and in whose presence the sky and the
earth tremble. This is why he declares through the voice of the prophet,
"Once again, and I will shake not only the earth, but also the
heaven" (Ag 2: 6). In front of his court, the whole human race appears.
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Principalities and Dominations are at his service
to punish the wicked and reward the good. Measure, dear brothers, what terror
will be on this day at the sight of such a Judge. No more recourse then against
punishment. What a confusion for him whom his fault will make blush before all
the angels and men gathered together! What a fright to see anger whose sight is
already unbearable for the human soul when it is calm! Seeing this day, the
prophet rightly said: "Day of wrath that day, day of tribulation and
anguish, day of calamity and misery, day of darkness and darkness, day of haze
and tornado a day of trumpet and trumpet ringtones. "(So 1, 15-16). On
this day of the Last Judgment, dear brothers, measure what terrible bitterness
the prophet must have seen him fill the heart of the reprobate so that he can
accumulate the terms without being able to express it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As for the
elect, what will be their joy to enter with the Bridegroom in the wedding room,
they deserve to enjoy the vision of the one they see tremble all the elements
by his presence! They will rejoice at the marriage of the Bridegroom, and yet
the wife is them; for in the nuptial chamber of the eternal Kingdom, God is
united with us in the vision: a vision that will last for eternity, without
anything ever being able to tear us away from the embraces of his love.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The door
of the Kingdom, which remains open every day to those who do penance, will then
be closed for those who come there crying. It will remain a penance, but it
will be barren. In fact, the one who is now wasting the time for forgiveness,
can not then find forgiveness. This is what makes Paul say: "Here he is
now, the favorable weather; here it is now, the day of salvation. "(2 Cor
6,2) The prophet also says, "Seek the Lord as long as he can be found,
call him as long as he is near." (Is 55, 6)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5.
Therefore the Lord does not listen to the foolish virgins who call him; because
the door of the Kingdom once closed, he who could still be close, now it will
not be. The text goes on: "Finally the other virgins also came, saying,
'Lord, Lord, open to us.' But he answered, 'Verily, I say to you, I do not know
you.'" Whoever did not want to listen to what God ordained here can no
longer obtain from God what he asks of him. Whoever wasted time for penance
comes in vain to beg before the door of the Kingdom. It is in this sense that the
Lord declares through Solomon's mouth, "I called, and you resisted; I
reached out, and nobody paid attention. You have despised all my advice, and
you have neglected my reproaches. I, too, will laugh at your death, I will make
fun of you when you get what you fear. When a sudden calamity melt on you and
death assails you like a storm, when tribulation and anguish come upon you,
then I will be summoned, and I will not listen; we will get up in the morning,
and we will not find myself "(Pr 1, 24-28). See, these virgins call loudly
to open them; repulsed, they exhale their grief by addressing to the Master a
redoubled appeal: "Lord, Lord, open to us." But they may offer their
prayers, but they are ignored; it is on this day that the Lord will abandon as
strangers those whom the merit of their lives does not make him recognize now
as his own.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

God accepts penance, and if everyone knew when to leave this world, he could

us, and seek an extension of life to mourn our sins; but this delay, which we

tell you, very dear brothers, a story that will be very edifying for you to
ponder, if your charity will listen to it carefully. There was, in the province
of Valerie, a nobleman named Chrysaorius, whom the people, in his countrymen's
words, called Chryserius. He was a very fortunate man, but also full of vices
and resources: swollen with pride, delivered to the pleasures of the flesh and
burned with a flame of avarice which excited him to increase his income. The
Lord, having decided to put an end to so many bad deeds, struck him with a
bodily disease, as I learned from a religious of his relatives who still lives.
Having reached the end of his life, just as he was about to leave his body, he
opened his eyes and saw hideous and very dark spirits stand in front of him and
press him hard to drag him to the hellish prisons. He began to tremble, to turn
pale, and to sweat profusely; he implored a respite</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">At that
time, Jesus told his disciples this parable: "The kingdom of heaven is
like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom and
the bride. Five of them were crazy, and five were wise. The five lunatics,
having taken their lamps, carried no oil; but the wise took oil in their vases
with the lamps. As the husband was slow to come, they all fell asleep and fell
asleep. In the middle of the night, a cry was heard: "Behold, the
bridegroom who comes, go out to meet him." Then all these virgins arose
and prepared their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us of your
oil, because our lamps are extinguished." The sages answered, "Lest
there be not enough for us and for you, go instead to merchants and buy them
for you. "But while they went to buy them, the bridegroom came, and those
who were ready entered with him into the wedding-hall, and the door was shut.
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to
us." But this one answered, "Truly, I say to you, I do not know
you."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Watch,

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
often, dear brothers, that I exhort you to flee the evil works and to avoid the
defilements of this world. But today, reading the Holy Gospel makes it my duty
to invite you to great vigilance even in your good deeds, lest you seek the
favor or recognition of men for what you do well, and that the desire of
praise, by slipping into it, deprives an inner reward of what you make appear
on the outside. Here indeed our Redeemer speaks to us of ten virgins. Now, if
he names them all virgins, yet he does not let them all go through the door of
bliss, because some of them, looking outside for glory for their virginity, did
not want to keep oil in their vases.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But we
must begin by asking ourselves what the Kingdom of Heaven is, and why we
compare it to ten virgins, some of whom are wise, and the other foolish. Since
it is clear that no reprobate enters the kingdom of heaven, why declare this
kingdom like wild virgins? We must know that in Holy Scripture the Church of
the present time is often called the Kingdom of Heaven. The Lord thus says in
another place: "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove
from his kingdom all scandals" (Mt 13:41). But it is not in the Kingdom of
Bliss, where peace is perfect, that they can find scandals to be removed. It is
in this sense that it is said elsewhere: "Whoever breaks one of these
least commandments and teaches men to do the same, he will be called the least
in the Kingdom of Heaven. . But whoever has practiced and taught them, he shall
be called great in the kingdom of heaven "(Mt 5:19). To break a commandment
and to teach it is not to practice in one's life what is preached by one's
mouth. But whoever does not want to practice what he teaches can not reach the
Kingdom of eternal bliss. How, then, will he be called the smallest, if he is
not allowed to enter it? Therefore, it is the Church of the earth that is
called the Kingdom of Heaven in the words of the Lord. In this Church, the
doctor who violates a command is called the smallest, because there is little
case of the preaching of a man whose life is despised.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

us, and seek an extension of life to mourn our sins; but this delay, which we
then ask with a very ardent desire, we enjoy, at this moment, without making
any case.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. I will
tell you, very dear brothers, a story that will be very edifying for you to
ponder, if your charity will listen to it carefully. There was, in the province
of Valerie, a nobleman named Chrysaorius, whom the people, in his countrymen's
words, called Chryserius. He was a very fortunate man, but also full of vices
and resources: swollen with pride, delivered to the pleasures of the flesh and
burned with a flame of avarice which excited him to increase his income. The
Lord, having decided to put an end to so many bad deeds, struck him with a
bodily disease, as I learned from a religious of his relatives who still lives.
Having reached the end of his life, just as he was about to leave his body, he
opened his eyes and saw hideous and very dark spirits stand in front of him and
press him hard to drag him to the hellish prisons. He began to tremble, to turn
pale, and to sweat profusely; he implored a respite with loud cries, and
frightened, he loudly called out his son Maxime, whom I knew as a monk when I
was. He said: "Maxime, come quickly! I've never hurt you, take me under
your protection. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Maxime,
deeply moved, approached immediately, while the family was gathering, lamenting
loudly. They could not see the evil spirits with which Chrysaorius was so hard
to attack, but they guessed the presence of these spirits by the confusion, the
pallor, and the tremblings of the one they carried away. The terror of their
terrible appearance made him turn sideways on his bed. Lying on the left side,
he could not bear their sight; he turned to the wall, they were still there.
Deeply in a hurry, desperate to escape them, he began to beg loudly: "Take
respite at least until morning!" Respite at least until morning! "But
while he was shouting, in the very midst of his screams, he was torn out of his
envelope of flesh.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is
obvious that if he saw these demons, it was not for his profit, but for ours,
because God, in his immense patience, still awaits us. For Chrysaorius, in
fact, it was useless to see these horrible spirits before his death, nor to ask
for respite, since he did not obtain it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But we
dear brothers, let us now reflect on all this with great attention, lest we be
allowed to waste time, and the moment when we shall ask for a reprieve to do
good works, is not exactly the same. where we will be forced to leave this
body. Remember these words of Truth: "Pray that your flight may not take
place in winter, nor on a sabbath day" (Mt 24:20). For a commandment of
the law forbids walking more than a certain distance on the Sabbath, and in the
winter it is difficult to walk because of the cold that numbs and paralyzes the
walkers' footsteps. So the Lord says, "Pray that your flight will not take
place in winter, nor on a Sabbath." It is as if he were saying clearly,
"Take care not to seek to flee your sins only. when it is no longer
possible for you to walk. "This moment when we will not be able to flee,
we must think of it now as we can. We must constantly think about the hour of
our coming out of this world, and continually before the eyes of the spirit
this warning of our Redeemer: "Watch therefore, because you know neither
the day nor the hour."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

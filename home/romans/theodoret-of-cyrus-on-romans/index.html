</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Various and
comprehensive is the doctrine which the holy apostle unfolds in the present
epistle. Its general scope is this:—worthy of all awe and adoration to the
sincere believer as is the mystery of the divine incarnation, clearly
manifesting, as it does, the loving mercy of God; they nevertheless who are
involved in the darkness of infidelity, and have not admitted the light of
intellectual illumination, scorn that which not even the company of angels can
worthily celebrate, as the inspired apostle distinctly says in his Epistle to
the Corinthians (I Cor. i. 18). "For the preaching of the cross is to them
that perish foolishness, but to them that are saved it is the power of
God." In this Epistle to the Romans, therefore, he exhibits the
indispensable necessity of this saving gospel, together with its utility and
advantage to all mankind, Jews or Greeks. In order to which, in the first place
he convicts the Greeks of having palpably corrupted the moral sense of good and
evil, implanted in their constitution by their Maker, and transgressed the
natural law; and secondly, the Jews of having, although in the enjoyment of the
written instructions of the divine laws, yet rejected the benefit arising from
them, and rendered themselves thereby obnoxious to the heavier retribution.
After this, he shows that our God and Saviour came not for the condemnation and
punishment of sinners, but to bring pardon for their offences, to promise
victory over death, and proclaim eternal life.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Again,
perceiving that the Jews clung but too much to the law, and those who savoured
of the errors <sup>1</sup> of Marcion and Valentine, with the Manichees, too
much altogether undervalued and condemned it, as an expert general surrounded
on all sides by his enemies strikes down first one, and then the other, so does
the holy apostle break in pieces, by divine grace, the band of the heretics,
and all the array of the Jews. For how does he conduct the argument? By neither
elevating the law too high, because of the extravagance of the Jews, nor giving
any occasion for reproach to the profane heretics, but demonstrating that it
taught all that was needful, and brought in the doctrine of justification,
although incompetent to convey justification itself by reason of the infirmity
of those under it; and showing that faith brings to effect the design of the
law, and what it fain would do, but cannot, it perfects through the grace of
the thrice holy Spirit. By all which we learn, how continually regardful of
mankind is God our Creator, in that not only did he implant in our nature the
power of discriminating between good and evil, but also by the very works of
his creation led such as were willing to piety and holiness, for although all
were not thus willing to see the truth, they who were had full enjoyment of it,
as they desired.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He next
further instructs us, that the God of all turned not to this plan of our
salvation, as though in a change of council from any of his former designs, but
as having long ago foretold it in the ancient prophets; he sets forth the cause
of the rejection of the Jews; and admonishes the believing Gentiles not to
boast over them; exhorting them to lead the way in the gospel. With these
doctrinal lessons he joins recommendations to practical virtue, at once
displaying the truth, and reforming the morals. Such then is the general
argument of the epistle, all the particulars in which the interpretation of the
separate passages will now clearly make known to us.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

superscribe their letters with the designations of their respective dignities,
priding themselves thereon, and puffed up in fancied greatness by each fresh
tide of honour; the holy apostle is content to call himself "one born out
of due time,"<sup>2</sup> and "the chief of sinners," and to
pronounce himself " unworthy the apostleship;" while yet, for the
benefit of such as should receive his epistles, he prefixes to them the
appellations which by grace he had obtained, that so, by seeing the honours
belonging to the writer, they might the more readily and zealously welcome them.
And he begins by Paul, not as having been so named of old by his parents, but
as preferred to it after his call, as was Simon to that of Peter, and the sons
of Zebedee to those of Sons of Thunder, Jacob to that of Israel, and Abram to
that of Abraham. Next, servant of Jesus Christ, whom infidels reviled as dead
and crucified, and a mere carpenter's son, and yet whose service the apostle
notwithstanding chose above any sovereignty.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

adds the name <i>an apostle</i>, teaching us that this also he had gained. For
since our Lord gave this designation to the twelve, so the holy apostle here
also places it, not as in a presumptuous self-assumption thereof, but as having
had it bestowed upon him by his Master himself. "For depart," said he
unto him, "because I will send thee for hence unto the Gentiles,"
(Acts xxii. 21;) and this be farther proves by what follows, namely; <i>separated
unto the gospel of God</i>. I am not self-elected, exclaims he, but have been
entrusted with the ministry of the word by God himself. Now it was the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who thus set him apart; for that the Father
did so, he himself declares in his Epistle to the Galatians (i. 15, 16). "
It pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his
grace, to reveal his Son in me; that I might preach him among the heathen and
that, again, the only- begotten Son did this likewise, is evident where the
apostle tells us in the Acts (xxiii. 21) how the Lord was seen of him in the
temple, commanding him to hasten and go out, because the Jews would not receive
his preaching, adding, "Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the
Gentiles."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And the very
same thing he said to Ananias, when he was hesitating and drawing back, (Acts
ix. 15;) "Go thy way, for this man is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my
name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel." And so
St Luke also tells us, (xiii. 2,) that "as the prophets were ministering
unto the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul
for the work whereunto I have called them." Evident therefore from hence
is the equality of the Trinity. And so also the gospel he now speaks of as the
gospel of God, and a little onward as <i>the gospel of the Son</i>, saying,
" for God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit <i>in the gospel of
his Son</i>." This I have not noted on idly, or to no purpose, but in
order to point out how indifferently the teachers of the truth mention the same
things, sometimes as those of the Father, and sometimes as those of the Son.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The
doctrines also preached he designates as <i>the gospel</i>, because they
promise the supply of so many blessings, announcing reconciliation with God,
the overthrow of the devil, forgiveness of sins, conquest over death, the
resurrection of the deceased, eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven. Having
then thus stated that he had been separated to the gospel of God, the holy
apostle next proceeds immediately to prove in the first place its antiquity,
lest any should be foolish enough to except against it as a novelty, and so
reject it; and says, </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

has promised afore by his prophets in the holy Scriptures</i>, for the Old
Testament is full of predictions concerning the Lord. Nor does he call them
holy for no reason, but firstly to show that he acknowledged their inspiration;
secondly, as excluding all other writings, for the inspired book alone contains
all things we can need. And he adds the nature of the promise,—</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><font size="3"><b><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">1:3.</span></b><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> <i>Concerning
his Son, which was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh</i>. By
all the prophets, says he, God has prophesied of the things relating to his
Son, who, in his nature begotten of him before all eternity, yet made himself
the son of David, inasmuch as he took his human nature, of the seed of David.
Having then thus mentioned David, it was necessary that he should subjoin, <i>according
to the flesh</i>, lest he should be considered as by nature the son of David,
and by grace only <a name="p38"><font color="#000000">|38</font></a> the Son of God; for the addition, <i>according
to the flesh</i>, indicates that as to his divinity he is in truth the Son of
God the Father. For indeed this phrase we can never find applied to those who
simply are such as they appear; as St. Matthew the evangelist witnesses, when
saying, Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah, and
so going through the whole genealogy in order, he never yet uses this
expression, according to the flesh, seeing that it suited not them which were
mere men; and so then the divine incarnate Word of God being not only man, but
God also from eternity, the apostle, having mentioned David, necessarily adds <i>according
to the flesh</i>, clearly to teach us how he was indeed the Son of God, and how
yet made to be of David;  </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

cross and passion, not only to the other Jews, but even to the apostles
themselves, our Lord Christ did not seem to be God; for they were misled by his
perfect humanity, when they saw him eating and drinking, and sleeping, and
becoming fatigued; nor could even his miracles bring them to this conviction;
and thus, for instance, when they beheld the miracle at the sea of Tiberias (Matt.
viii. 27,) they cried out, "What manner of man is this, that even the
winds and the sea obey him!" In full accordance with which, our Lord said
unto them, (John xvi. 12,) "I have many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them yet. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
guide you into all truth and again, (Luke xxiv. 49,) "Tarry ye here in
this city, until ye shall be endued with power from on high, the holy Ghost

resurrection and ascension to heaven, and the illumination of the thrice holy
Spirit, and the various miracles which by the invocation of his sacred name
they performed, all the faithful knew that be is God, and the only-begotten Son
of God. This then the holy apostle teaches here, that he, who according to the
flesh was designated as the son of David, was proved and set forth as the Son
of God, in the power exercised by the thrice holy Spirit, after the
resurrection from the dead of the same our Lord Jesus Christ; </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

same time honours them with such high and divine appellations, and represses
every rising of arrogance. For, in the first place, instead of making any
distinction between them as the masters of the world, and the other nations, he
joins them with them; and, secondly, he writes to all, without respect of
persons, addressing together, servants, beggars, and working-people; the
wealthy, and the powerful; for that there were some of the latter who believed,
he shows in the Epistle to </font><a name="p39"><font color="#000000" size="3">|39</font></a><font size="3"> the Philippians, (iv. 22,)
saying, "They that are of Caesar's household salute you." It is
evident, indeed, that he writes not to the unbelieving, but to those already
converted, wherefore he calls them both <i>called</i>, and <i>saints,</i>
exalting them with such spiritual appellations, and inflaming thereby their
love towards their great Benefactor. <i>Grace be unto you, and peace from God

completes the introduction to his letter, "Paul, a servant of Jesus
Christ, to all that in Rome are beloved of God, called saints; grace be unto

which intervenes he threw in between, in order to mark whose messenger be had
been constituted, and what were the tidings wherewith he had been entrusted,
and to whom he had been commissioned to bring them. And he invokes on them
first <i>God's grace</i>, because by this it was that believers obtained
salvation; and next <i>peace</i>, by which he indicates the full establishment
of virtue, since he alone has peace with God who has embraced an evangelical
course, seeking ever to serve him in all things. And of these gifts he shows
that not the Father only, but the Son also is the giver, in saying, <i>from God
our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;</i> by which expression he plainly
teaches the equality of the Father and the Son.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

monarchs proceeded, and the collectors of tribute throughout the different
cities, and there resorted all who sought the favour of royalty, by all of whom
it was spread abroad, that Rome bad received the doctrine of Christ; which was
of the greatest benefit to those who heard it, on which account the holy

simply say that he begged for this entrance unto them, but <i>according to the

I have been appointed the teacher of all nations, wherefore I owe the debt of
an evangelist not to the Greeks only, but to the Barbarians also. For this was
it that the grace of the Spirit conferred on us the gift of other tongues; and
it behoves us to discharge our debt both to those who boast in their wisdom,
and to those who are unlearned likewise. By wise he means those who prided
themselves on their eloquence; by unwise, those who for their ignorance were so
denominated by such as were called philosophers, or wise men. And, as not all
would receive the preaching of the gospel, fitly has he added, <i>as much as in
me lies</i>; for it is mine to preach, but the believing depends on the
hearers. And as he frequently calls this preaching by the name of the gospel,
and the gospel contains an account of our Lord's passion, cross, and death, all
which to the unbeliever seemed full of dishonour, he seasonably adds, </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

look not, says he, to the apparent disgrace, but to the blessing arising
therefrom, namely, that from it believers obtain salvation. <a name="p95"><font color="#000000">|95</font></a>

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And thus of
mere outward objects many have their own property bidden within them; as
pepper, for instance, has a cold appearance, and to those that are unacquainted
with it shows no sign of heat, while he that bites it with his teeth perceives
its fiery nature; on which account physicians rank it among hot things as to
its quality, as though not looking so, and yet capable of being proved to be
such. And thus also corn may become the root, and the stock, and the ear, which
yet it could never seem, until it has been sown in the furrows of the field.
Justly then does the holy apostle call the saving gospel <i>the power of God</i>,
as exhibiting its power, and bestowing salvation, only on believers. And this
he says is offered to all, both Jews and Greeks; and the Jews he puts first,
before the Greeks, inasmuch as our Lord Christ sent the holy apostles as
preachers to them first; for thus God proclaims by the prophet (Is. xlii. 6,)
"I have appointed thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
gentiles calling the Jews the people, since of them he sprung according to the
flesh. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

apostle here teaches us how from of old God has thus provided for us, and
predicted the same by the prophets; and even before the prophets, had his own
determination concerning these things secretly within himself, for this also he
states in another place, (Eph. iii. 9,) saying, "The mystery which hath
been hidden in God, who created all things; "and again, (1 Cor. ii. 7,)
"We speak the wisdom hidden in a mystery, which God foreordained before
the world, unto our glory." And here therefore he says not that <i>righteousness
is given</i>, but <i>revealed</i>; for that which had been so long hidden is
now made known to believers. <i>From faith to faith</i>, says he; for we ought
to believe the prophets, and by them be brought to the faith of the gospel.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But this may
bear another sense also; for he who believes in our Lord Christ, and has
received the grace of the most holy baptism, and enjoys the free gift of
adoption, is led on to believe in yet further coming blessings; the
resurrection of the dead, I mean, eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven. By
the <i>righteousness of God, revealed in the gospel</i>, he speaks not only of
that which is hereby supplied to us, but that also which is so plainly set
forth in the mysterious scheme of this his dispensation. For he effected not
our salvation by mere power, nor destroyed the strength of death by his mere
voice and command, but by combining pity with justice. For the very
only-begotten Word of God, by putting on the nature of Adam, and keeping it
free from all sin, obtained this for us, and paying the debt of nature,
discharged the common forfeit of mankind.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But all this
the holy apostle teaches more clearly below, and it were better for us to
follow on our exposition passage by passage. Having then said that this
salvation was offered to both Jews and Greeks, provided they were themselves
duly disposed towards it, he confirms the assertion by the testimony of
Scripture, saying, <i>Even as it is written, The just shall live by faith</i>.
This he subjoins for the sake of the Jews, in order to teach them not to cling
still to the dispensation of the law, but listen rather to their own prophets,
who from of old set forth salvation </font><a name="p96"><font color="#000000" size="3">|96</font></a><font size="3"> through faith. And
here, quitting his first point—the censure of the Jews, he commences his charge
against all the gentile nations, that they had recklessly violated the law
implanted in their nature by their Maker. And this blame of them includes a
vindication of the Creator; for when he formed them, he suffered them not to
live like the irrational creation, but dignified them with reason, and gave
them judgment, and established in them the power of discriminating between good
and evil; which position is evidenced by such as, before the coming of the
Mosaic law, were illustrious for holiness and virtue, as well as by such as
followed the opposite course. For so Adam, the instant he had transgressed the
commandment, and eaten the forbidden fruit, attempted to hide himself, under
the stings of conscience; and when called to account, neither denied what had
been done, nor pretended ignorance in his defence, but threw the blame of the
accusation on the woman; which plainly shows that our nature possessed the
power of discerning the true character of things. And thus again Cain, having
privily slain his brother, when examined, "Where is thy brother
Abel?" denied it, and attempted to conceal what had been done, but when
convicted, confessed that his punishment was just, and owned the equity of his
judge, acknowledging that he had sinned beyond pardon; and a thousand other
similar instances are to be found in the holy Scriptures: wherefore the holy
apostle adds, </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and

taught them both that God was the Maker of all things, and that they ought to
avoid unrighteousness, and seek righteousness; but they used not the
instructions which it gave as they ought to have done; wherefore he threatened
them with future punishment.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the word <i>revealed</i>, in that disbelievers who hearkened not to those
threats were the very persons who should experience the truth of what he said.
And vengeance he calls the <i>wrath of God</i>; not that God punishes with any
passion of mind, but that by giving it so awful a name he might alarm the
gainsayer. And he says, is revealed <i>from heaven,</i> because our God and
Saviour will appear from thence, as the Lord himself declares, (Mark xiii. 26,)

creation, the succession of time, the change of seasons, the alternations of
day and night, the labourings of the clouds, the blasts of the winds, the fruitfulness

lovingkindness, can never leave neglected what He hath brought into being;

the sin themselves had committed two and twenty years before, so that they
cried one to another, (Gen. xlii. 21, 22,) that the blood of our younger
brother is required at our hands, while Reuben reminded them of his entreaties
among them. Agreeably then to this instance may we describe the future judgment
and conscience of those who lived beyond the polity of the law, now as pleading
their defence, and alleging ignorance, and now again admitting the justice of
the accusation, and confessing the equity of the sentence passed upon them. And
thus, again, Abimelech, (Gen. xx. 4, 8,) having the testimony of his own
conscience, cried to God, "Lord, wilt thou slay an unconscious and

it is written, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings, and mightest
overcome when Thou judgest</i>. The word that here denotes not the reason, but
the result; for we do not therefore sin in order that we may set forth the
loving-kindness of God, but Himself supplies the streams of His mercies to
bring salvation to all; while men being free agents,<sup>6</sup> some prefer
the service of God, and some walk in the contrary direction; and so each find
their end correspondent with the path they have chosen. But still God's mercies
having been extended to them (the latter) also, thus <i>is He fully justified

have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me, </font><a name="p233"><font color="#000000" size="3">|233</font></a><font size="3">

without the law, and those within it, have both gone astray</i>, and he adds
the testimony of David as exactly adapted to the matter in hand; and he does
so, as being particularly studious of brevity, since otherwise he might have

Persians, and Medes, and Egyptians, and many other nations, but, nevertheless,
even these predictions concerning them it addresses to the Jews. <i>That every

again, he employs the word that according to his favourite idiom, (or use of
it,) for the God of all did not therefore bestow laws, and send forth His
exhortations among men, <i>in order that</i> He might render them obnoxious to

shalt not commit adultery;" "Thou shalt do no murder;"
"Thou shalt not steal;" "Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbour;" "Honour thy father and mother and others of
this kind: for they who had never received that law, were yet fully aware that
each of these was deserving not only of condemnation, but of punishment
likewise. And some, again, the Lawgiver imposed on the Jews as suitable to them
for that present time only; such, I mean, as circumcision, and the sabbath, and
sacrifices, and sprinklings, and the rites respecting the leper, and the
seminally unclean, and such-like; which are the symbols of other things, and
when fulfilled, are not in themselves sufficient to make the doer just. <a name="p235"><font color="#000000">|235</font></a> Wherefore the holy apostle says, <i>therefore by the works
of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight</i>; and then, lest
any one should suppose that he was passing a censure on the law, he adds, <i>For
by the law is the knowledge of sin</i>. The law, says he, has given to man a
more accurate discrimination of sin, and made the condemnation lying on it the
heavier; but for the establishment of virtue it is not competent to be
sufficient for men.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

was necessary that he should resume the phrase again, and show that it was <i>by
faith in the Lord Christ</i> that <i>all </i>who desired to do so enjoyed it,
whether Jews or Greeks; the <i>unto all</i> refers to the Jews, the <i>upon all</i>

propitiatory was a golden plate, which lay over the ark, having at either end
the figure of a cherub, (Exod. xxv.) and from thence the mercy of God was
manifested to the high priest in his ministrations. The holy apostle here then
teaches, that the Lord Christ was the true propitiatory, for that ancient one
was but a type of this. This name, however, is applied to Him as man, and not
as God; for as God He Himself speaks from the propitiatory; while as man He
receives this appellation even as others, such as "sheep" and
"lamb," and <a name="p236"><font color="#000000">|236</font></a> "sin" and
"curse," and the like. (See John i. 29, 36. Acts viii. 32. 2 Cor. v.
21. Gal. iii. 13.) And the ancient propitiatory was bloodless in itself,
inasmuch as it was also inanimate, and received only the sprinklings of the
blood of the victims; but the Lord is God, and propitiatory, and high priest,
and lamb, arid in His own blood hath worked out our salvation, demanding faith
only from us.—<i>To declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that

God has both exhibited His own mercy in so long bearing with sinners, and has
made manifest His righteousness to all men; for that it was not without any
further view that He thus bore with sinners, but as preparing for them this
mean of salvation, the next sentence shows—<i>that He might be just, and the
justifier of him that believeth in Jesus</i>. For both these things should we
learn from hence, that the God of all has ordered His dispensations concerning
ourselves with justice equally as with mercy; and that whosoever believes in
the Lord Christ is made partaker of the righteousness which is by faith.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

nations, this arrogance had been put out of the question, in that God had given
to man a short and easy mean of salvation in faith; for this the apostle
continues to show forth in the following sentences also, <i>By what law</i>? <i>of

not from inconsideration, but as recollecting the prophecy of Jeremiah (xxxi.

him in the circumcision; and this he lays down again, yet more clearly, in what
follows, <i>Not to them only who are of the circumcision, but to them also who
walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had while yet
uncircumcised</i>. For if any one sprung from the Gentiles, and not having
received circumcision, should follow in the footsteps of that faith of the
patriarch, which he had before his own circumcision, he would not fail of
relationship to him; in that the God of all, foreseeing, as God, that He would
hereafter gather together one people of the Gentiles, and the Jews, and extend
to them salvation through faith, represented both of old in the patriarch
Abraham. And thus then he calls him <i>the father</i> of the Gentiles, in
having shown that he had acquired, before his circumcision, the righteousness
which is of faith, and after his circumcision, had not walked under the Mosaic
law, but continued under the guidance of the same faith; in order that both
Jews and Greeks, looking to him, might in common aim at his faith, neither the
one anxious for his circumcision, nor the other his uncircumcision, for it is

reigned sin had power, for where there is no law, neither can there be transgression.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the

the Corinthians (iii. 15,) " But even unto this day, when <i>Moses</i> is
read, the vail is upon their hearts," that is, the law. Death then, says
he, reigned from Adam until the manifestation of the Saviour, for then the law
received its end, "for the law," says he, "and the prophets,
prophesied until John; but from the days of John the kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." (Matt. xi. 12, 13.)
And death, moreover, reigned over those also, who had not sinned after the
likeness of Adam's transgression, for although they had not transgressed that
particular commandment, they had nevertheless ventured on other sins. And he
calls Adam the <i>type</i> of Christ, for the latter he designates as <i>Him
that would come after</i>, on this account, that as Adam first, by his sin,
became subject to the sentence of death, and thus the whole race followed their
first parent, so the Lord Christ, having fulfilled the most perfect
righteousness, destroyed the power of death, and first rising from the dead
shall restore the whole race of man to life. And as he had called Adam the type
of Christ, he shows the pre-eminence (of the latter.) </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

As regards punishment, says he, the Lord God preserved the strict law of
justice, and Adam, having sinned, and been given over to death, the whole race
followed him; how much more right then that, as regards God's loving-mercy,
justice should also be preserved, and all men share in the resurrection of our

sinned the whole race received the sentence of death; it is plain, that the
righteousness of the Saviour gains life to all men. And again he puts the same
thing in another form, varying his phrase, and again and again re-stating it,

shewn us, from what took place through Adam, the reasons for the divine
incarnation, he brings forward the objection<sup>17</sup> which might arise,

in the interim between Adam and the appearance of the Saviour; wherefore the
holy apostle says, </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

it might</i>, that such was its object; but uses the words according to his
familiar mode of expression.<sup>18</sup> But what he is shewing is, that
neither in time past did God leave men neglected, but gave the law to the Jews,
and by their means showed forth the light of religion on the rest of the
nations also. And aptly has he put <i>intervened</i>, in that Christ was the
end of the promise made to the patriarch; for "in thy seed," says He,
"shall all the nations of the earth be blessed," and the law <i>intervened</i>
between Abraham and Christ. And it taught the more clearly how evil a thing sin
was, while yet it was incompetent to put a stop thereto, but only the more
increased it, seeing that, in proportion as more commandments were given, so
many the more became the violations of them. <i>But where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound</i>. It invalidated not, says he, the mercy of God, but
rather displayed the vastness of His loving-kindness. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

sin had reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord</i>. Here he finishes the argument,
shewing that as sin, begetting death, had reigned in our mortal bodies,
exciting the passions to excess; so grace, conveying to believers the justification
which is of faith, has her dominion also, one not coeval with that of sin, but
eternal and endless; for the former reigns over our bodies, but at their death
ceases from her power, "for he who is dead," according to the holy
apostle, "is freed from sin;" while, after the resurrection, our
bodies having become imperishable, and immortal, grace will reign in them, sin
having no longer any place; for when the passions have ceased, there will be no
room for sin. And then again he proposes another objection arising from the
subject, and with ease resolves it. <a name="p407"><font color="#000000">|407</font></a> </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

dissolve a marriage when it should be no longer agreeable, but he was mindful
of our Lord's assertion, which declared that Moses gave them that law on
account of the hardness of the heart of the Jews, but that the law of nature
had added no such terms, for one man, says he, and one woman did God make,

mode of expression, and says not, "the law is made to cease," but <i>we
are made to cease from the law</i>, that is, it is inoperative as regards
ourselves, we are no longer under its polity. And how are we made to cease from
it? <i>Being dead to that wherewith we had been held</i>. For when we were
subjects of the law we came to baptism, and dying with Christ, and with Him
rising again, we were united to our Lawgiver, and no longer need the polity of
the law, for we have received the very grace itself of the Spirit, as what
follows proves, <i>that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the

covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not according
to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by
the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt so that the difference was
shown even by the prophet; and on the appearance of the new covenant, the old
must yield. Having thus spoken, and foreseeing as one honoured with the gifts
of the Spirit, that some of the heretics would understand this in derogation of
the old covenant, and conceive that the old law came from some other than the
one same God, the holy apostle necessarily states the objections and subjoins
the answers to them. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

law entered in between that the offence might abound;" and "the law
worketh wrath;" and "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in His sight;" and the like; wherefore, for the resolution of
these very things he proposes the objection. And first he shows that the
interrogation is profane, and adds the expression of disavowal, <i>God forbid</i>,
and then he teaches the utility of the law. <i>Nay but I should not have been
aware of what was sin, but by the law</i>. Not only, says he, is the law not
the teacher of sin, God forbid, but on the contrary it is the condemner of sin,
for I should not have known what was evil, unless it had shown me. <i>For I
should not have known that lust was, except the law had said Thou shall not
lust</i>. The words <i>I should not have been aware</i>, and <i>I should not

In every way he endeavours to show that it was free from blame, for having said
that by the imposition of the law sins had been increased, lest any one should

that sin making use of the imposition of the law as a mean for battle, beat
down the weaker powers of judgment. <i>For without the law sin were dead</i>,

intention of the law, and the end brought about by sin, were widely different

the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good</i>. It is the
Mosaic which he here speaks of as the law, and that given to Adam as the <i>commandment</i>.
And the reason why he honours the latter with the greater praises, is that it
commonly meets with the greater censures. For they who live in idle ease, and
will not undergo the labours of virtue, cry out even against God Himself, for
imposing this commandment. For if He were ignorant, say they, of what would happen,
how can He be God who foreknows not the future? but if while foreseeing the
transgression, He yet imposed the commandment, Himself is the cause of the <a name="p483"><font color="#000000">|483</font></a> transgression! But such should be aware, that the power of
discriminating between good and its opposite is the property of those that are
gifted with reason, for the nature of the irrational creatures possesses no
such faculty of distinguishment of these things; for the wolf is ravenous, and
the lion feasts on its prey while scarce dead, and bears and leopards follow in
the same train; and they have no sense of sin,<sup>22</sup> nor a conscience to
be pricked at what has been done; while men, though no one be present at their
actions, are ashamed and afraid on account of what they have dared to commit,
for conscience supplies the accusation. How then were it possible that they who
possess such a nature, should yet live without any law at all? Wherefore God
enjoined the commandment, that man might thereby learn to understand his own
nature, and to fear his Lawgiver. And well indeed may we perceive the
loving-kindness of that Lawgiver, for He enjoined, not some law which was
difficult of observation, but one which could have been easily kept. He allowed
to him the enjoyment of all the trees, of one alone He forbade him the use; not
that He grudged him that one, for how could He do so, who had already given him
power over all? but in order to teach him the terms of submission, and to
render him well-affected towards his Creator, and afford a mean for the
exercise of his rational faculties. And if then, by not keeping the commandment
he came under sentence of death, this can be no cause for blame to the
Lawgiver, but to him who transgressed the law. For so neither, when a physician
orders his patient to abstain from cold drinks, does he do this because he
invidiously grudges them to him, but in order to bring about his health; and if
he not observing the injunction will take water, he draws the injury on
himself, but the physician is free from blame altogether. But indeed the Lord
God has treated with every possible consideration and kindness, both Adam
himself and all his race, and, to pass by all other, and come at once to the
noblest instance, for him, and his race, the only-begotten Word became
incarnate, and put an end to the power of death, which from him had received
its beginning, and promised the resurrection, and prepared the kingdom of
heaven: so that He both foreknew his transgression, and made ready before-hand
the mean of remedy to follow; wherefore the holy apostle calls the commandment
holy, just, and good; <i>holy</i>, as teaching what we ought to do; <i>just</i>,
as rightly pronouncing judgment on the transgressors; <i>good</i>, as
appointing life to such as observed it. And then again he states the objection
that might arise, </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that which is good become death unto me</i>? and again according to his wont he
denies it, God forbid, and shows us the cause of these evils, <i>but sin, that
it might appear to be </i>(indeed) <i>sin, in its working death to me by that
which is good</i>. There is an obscurity here, arising from the extreme brevity
made use of; what he means is this, that <i>by that which is good</i>, to wit
the law and commandment, <i>sin is made apparent to me</i>, namely, as being
bad and evil; and how is it so made apparent? <i>by</i> its <i>working unto
death</i>, for from the fruit I know the tree, and seeing death I hate its
parent; but of all this is the law the teacher; it is not then the <a name="p484"><font color="#000000">|484</font></a> law, which thus instructs, that is evil, but sin, which
brings death; and it is the inclination of our own free will to the worse, that
is the author of sin. <i>That sin might by the commandment become exceeding
sinful</i>. For though nature points out sin, its excessive turpitude the law
has more clearly manifested. The expression <i>that it might become</i> is
incomplete, the word "apparent" being understood, for so also we
explained it in the preceding sentence, "but sin, that it might be seen to
be sin indeed by its working out death to me by that which is good, that sin
might by the commandment become exceeding sinful," that is, that it might
become by the commandment " apparent" that sin is exceeding sinful,
that is evil. And then, like some skilful painter, he portrays the contest

perfection of the law, to point out what is evil and implant a hatred of it in

denote compulsion, but weakness; for we sin not because driven thereto by some

elucidation somewhat more at length. The body then after the transgression of
the commandment becoming mortal received passions and appetites, since by these
it is that our present state of existence is carried on. For thus it needs
desire, not only for the provision thereby of food, but for the procreation of
children also, and for agriculture's sake, and the various other arts, none of
which could exist were desire altogether wanting. Thus it also contributes to
our perseverance in well-doing, for nothing but such an affection for and
desire of virtue could qualify us to bear its attendant difficulties. And so
also does it work within us the Divine love.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

measure of desire then is an auxiliary to good, but its disorder brings forth
intemperance, in that it leads us to lay snares against the marriage-bed of
others, and to covet what does not belong to us, and to steal, and to break
open tombs (in order to spoil the dead), and to commit manslaughter, and become
guilty of other the like crimes; wherefore has the God of all added side by
side to it (an uncalculating) impetuosity,<sup>23</sup> that the latter might
repress the extravagance of the others, </font><a name="p609"><font color="#000000" size="3">|609</font></a><font size="3"> while itself also
needing a check on its own excesses. As then we dilate with what is too cold,
that which is hot, and again correct what is too cold by what is hot, even so
has God our Creator, by implanting in us these two passions directly opposed to
each other, taught us to check each reciprocally by the other. For over them He
has placed the mind, like a charioteer over his horses, and imposed the yoke of
submission on them, enjoining both to bear it evenly together;<sup>24</sup> if
then it happen that desire springs forward beyond the line, He bids her goad up
impetuosity, that this rushing onward may again bring the yoke straight; and,
if that admit the overworkings of its own temper, again in its turn He orders
desire to be pressed forward, that it may correct the excess of impetuosity.
The mind then, if watchful and prudent, thus keeps under and directs them,
while if negligent, and letting the reins go, she becomes the means of her
horses breaking away, and is herself dragged onward, and with them falls into
pits and down precipices. This then is what the holy apostle means by <i>now it
is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me</i>, by sin intending the
enslavement of the mind, and the usurpation of the passions; and <i>he</i> then

nevertheless evil is ever at hand with me, that is, sin, by reason of my possessing

sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful fleshy and for sin, condemned sin

likeness of <i>sinful</i> flesh, for He received actually the human nature, but
human sin he received not; wherefore that which He thus assumed, he calls not
the <i>likeness</i> of flesh, but the likeness of <i>sinful</i> flesh, because
though He had the same nature with ourselves, He yet had not the same character
or disposition. He means, then, that the law having been unable to bring to
effect its own design, by reason of the weakness of those beneath its covenant,
possessing as they did a mortal nature, and one obnoxious to infirmities and
passions; the only-begotten <a name="p611"><font color="#000000">|611</font></a> Word of God, becoming
incarnate, by that human flesh overthrew sin, in having fulfilled all
righteousness, and admitted no taint of sin; and by enduring the death of
sinners, as though Himself a sinner, manifested the injustice of sin, in that
it delivered up to death a body over which death had no just claim. And this
then both overthrew it and put an end to death; for in thus submitting to death
through the unjust sentence of sin, while not at all obnoxious to it, in that
He never committed sin, did He become the price of redemption of those justly
subjected unto death, as one free among the dead: for so he also teaches in

This superiority has (the covenant of) grace over (that of) the law, that the

showing that it was written by the grace of the Spirit. Not, therefore, the
thrice-holy Spirit itself does he here call <i>the spirit of bondage</i>, but
the imposition of the law as effected by that holy Spirit; for had be by <i>the

there have been another Spirit, of adoption; but not so is it, for the

bidden to address Him as our Father, and we say, "Our Father which art in

also of God, and joint heirs with Christ, for so he subjoins, <i>heirs of God,
and joint heirs with Christ</i>. Since not every son becomes the heir of his
father, well has the holy apostle joined the heirship with the sonship; and
since frequently even a servant receives some portion from his master, and yet
is not left an equal partner with the child itself, it was necessary, in order
to point out the ineffable magnitude of the divine love, that he should
subjoin, <i>joint heirs with Christ,—if so be that we suffer with Him, that we
may be also glorified together</i>. For not all who have been blessed by
baptism, which places us in a state of salvation, will enjoy these good things,
but they, who in addition thereto, have undergone their share of suffering with
their Saviour.<sup>31</sup>  And this he subjoins not without a distinct
object, but for the support of those to whom his letters were addressed; for
they were subjected to the attacks of temptations of all sorts, being beaten,
tortured, and <a name="p674"><font color="#000000">|674</font></a> imprisoned, and exposed to a thousand kinds

declares that the whole visible creation had obtained a mortal nature, because
the Maker of all had foreseen Adam's transgression, and the sentence of death,
which would be passed on him. For neither was it fit nor right, that what was
created for him should possess an incorruption, and yet himself, for whose sake
all these were made, be mortal, and a prey to passions and sufferings; but the
rather, by the resurrection receiving immortality, they in like manner inherit
incorruption. Wherefore he says that the visible creation waits for such a
change of things, for it was made changeable not of its own accord, but in
submission to the decree of the Creator, and beholding the care exhibited in
our behalf has a hope of such change, that itself also, the creation, shall be

corruption. And all this he says, not meaning that the visible creation really
was gifted with reason, but by a prosopopoeia, as was common with the prophets,

so likewise) the God of all, from of old knows all things as God, not that He
imposes on any one a necessity for his establishment in virtue, or on another
for his performance of vice; for if He exercised force towards either, He could
not with justice praise and reward the former, or adjudge punishment to the

well affected towards one who is rich, does he love him for the abundance of
his wealth; but from his very affection towards him, loves also the possessions
belonging to him; and in like manner the holy apostle declares, I would not

devoid of love to Him. Which therefore that ourselves may also possess, let us

incarnation of our God and Saviour both was necessary, and was productive of
unspeakable blessings to believers, the holy apostle has clearly shown. For he
has proved the Jews to be obnoxious to the greater condemnation by reason of
the imposition of the law, and all others to be transgressors of the law of
nature; and having set forth the threat of punishment, he has subjoined the
gifts of the grace in the gospel (covenant), and pointed out the salvation
offered through faith; while, at the same time, lest the Jews should be offended,
imagining the law censured; or the heretics, hostile to the ancient covenant,
gain an opportunity of accusation against the law by the comparison thus
instituted, he has necessarily exhibited the usefulness of the law, and
honoured it with many praises. And as, again, the Jews, bringing forward the
patriarch Abraham, and the promises made by God to him, endeavoured to prove
that the preaching of the apostles, being extended to the Gentiles beyond the
divine promise, was contrary to these, he is constrained to treat of these
objections also; and most wisely does he answer them, by adducing scripture
testimonies, and ancient examples, applicable to the case, and demonstrating
plainly the truth of the divine promises. Being about then to denounce the
infidelity of the Jews, he first displays the love he bore them, and says,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

significations, for that which is consecrated to God is called an anathema, and
that which is separated from Him has the same name, and this second meaning the
holy apostle has taught us in the Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. xvi. 22),
"If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema"—the
first being explained even by common custom, for so we designate whatever is
offered to God an anathema—and the God of all things Himself, in commanding the
town of Jericho to be made an anathema (Joshua vi. 17). Here then the blessed apostle
uses it in its second meaning, to manifest the feelings he entertained towards
his brother Jews, and he says not I could desire, but I could <i>pray</i> to be
separated from Christ, provided that they who are my kindred in the flesh,
being united to Him, should reap salvation; and most aptly does he introduce
the  "even I <i>myself</i>"   recalling to their
recollection what he <a name="p739"><font color="#000000">|739</font></a> had just before stated of his love
to Christ, and as it were saying, that I, whom "neither life, nor death,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor any other such creation, could
separate from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus," would gladly be
alienated from Him, for the sake of the salvation of the Jews. But it is
evident that he speaks not this as preferring them to the Saviour, but as
indicating his love and anxiety for them, being most desirous that all should
submit themselves, and joyfully receive the saving gospel. And to persuade them
of the truth of what he says, he points out both their former high descent and

the difference of the natures, and teaching how just reason he had for his

Jacob, born of different mothers, four of them being bondsmen on one side, and

so, He cannot with justice inflict punishment on the offenders, for it is not

creation, have been silent, and acquiesced in His dispensations; but since thou
art dignified by reason, (therefore it is that) thou both sayest and doest what

silence what is done; but thou opposest and findest fault; therefore art thou
not bound by physical necessity, nor transgressest against thine own

He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He
had afore prepared unto glory; </i><b>24.</b>
<i>Even us whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.</i>
God, says he, was not the author of Pharaoh's wickedness, but exercised
long-suffering towards him as He is wont, but he conceived <a name="p34"><font color="#000000">|34</font></a>
that long-suffering weakness, and through it increased his own obstinacy; while
at the same time the Governor of all things, in His wisdom both justly
inflicted punishment on him, and from his very wickedness drew a preventive
medicine to the rest. And thus, as physicians do not themselves make vipers,
but from them prepare drugs profitable to men, so God preferred that Pharaoh
should not suffer punishment, but, inasmuch as he had fallen into so great
brutishness, brought on him retributions of every kind, and manifested at the
same time His own power to all men; wherefore He says, "even for this same
purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and that My
name might be declared throughout all the earth the <i>I have raised thee up</i>
meaning, I have permitted thee to obtain the throne, and while able to prevent,
prevented thee not, foreseeing the advantage that would thence arise to others.
And those whom he calls <i>vessels of wrath fitted to destruction</i>, are they,
who, by their own free will, have become so, for the same thing also has he
written to Timothy, (2 Tim. ii. 20) "But in a great house there are not
only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also of wood, and of earth; and some
to honour, and some to dishonour;" and, teaching how every one becomes the
one or the other of his own free will, he subjoined, "if a man, therefore,
purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and
meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work;" and to the
Corinthians, in like manner, he writes (1 Cor. iii. 12), "Now if any man
build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
stubble," —clearly teaching the free agency of man. So here does he call
those who are worthy of the divine loving-kindness, <i>vessels of mercy</i>.
And the <i>hath before prepared unto glory</i> displays the divine
foreknowledge, for so had he also said before, "for whom He had foreknown
He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son;" for the
object of the apostle is to prove, that the God of all things alone knows who
are worthy of salvation, while among men not a soul. And having stated that <i>He
hath called us not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles</i>, he confirms
the representation by the testimony of scripture, and says, </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

saith also in Osee</i> (ch. ii. 23, and i. 10), <i>I will call them My people,
which were not My people, and her beloved, which was not beloved.</i> <b>26.</b> <i>And it shall come to pass that
in the place where it was said unto them, ye are not My people; there shall
they be called the children of the living God</i>. And this God spake not of
the Gentiles, but of the Jews themselves; for having commanded Hosea to marry
an harlot, and indeed even an adulteress, thus did He order the children born
from her to be called, the one <i>not a people</i> (Loammi), and the other <i>not
beloved</i> (Loruhamah) (ch. i. 9, 6), foretelling what should happen to the
Jews; while at the same time He promised them good things again, that the <i>not
people should be called a people</i>, and the <i>not beloved, beloved</i>.
Observe therefore, says he, that even you have not always enjoyed the same
things, but at one time have been reckoned <i>a people</i>, and then <i>not a
people</i>, and then <i>a people</i> again; and at one time <i>beloved</i>, and
then <i>not beloved</i>, and then <i>beloved</i> again. Nothing then improbable
has taken place at present, for you have been cast off in due consistency with
all this; but and so if yet you again will it, you shall be reckoned <i>a
people</i>, <i>and beloved</i>; for so also the Gentiles who were not a people,
now are <a name="p35"><font color="#000000">|35</font></a> reckoned a people. And he adduces another witness
also to this account: </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

as the sand of the sea, a remnant (only) shall be saved.</i> <b>28.</b> <i>For a short word will the Lord
make upon the earth</i> (ch. x. 22, 23). Most opportunely has he brought
forward this evidence, to show that, of old, the God of all foresaw both those
who had attached themselves to the faith, and those who had sunk beneath the
disease of infidelity. For as the Jews alleged that but few of them had
accepted the gospel, and all the rest had turned away from it as a deception,
he proves that all this had long ago been predicted, and that although they
should exceed the power of numbers in multitude, and equal the sand of the sea,
not all, but such (only) as were furnished with faith, should obtain salvation.
For faith is what he calls the <i>short word</i>, because what the law taught
in many commandments, while yet unable to afford complete salvation, that
confession in Christ has accomplished, while engendering faith. And this is <i>short</i>,
and needs not multiplied periods, being evidenced by the disposition of the
heart,<sup>3</sup> and published by the tongue. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

seed</i>, through whom the prophet declares that the Jews suffered not the fate
of Sodom and Gomorrah, for they had undergone a total destruction. Having thus
taught that the God of all things looks not to the mere relationship of birth,
but seeks for a community of faith, he shows yet more clearly by what means the
Jews had fallen from their ancestral excellence, and the Gentiles on the other
hand had obtained salvation. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the living under the law was sufficient to secure righteousness to them, and
they despised faith; wherefore they neither obtained the gifts of faith, nor
gained the righteousness arising from living under its covenant. And then he
teaches through what cause they enjoyed not the blessings of faith; <i>For they
stumbled at that stumbling-stone.</i> </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the veriest minutiae<sup>4</sup> of the law, they chose not to see the <i>stone</i>
foretold by the prophets, although they had distinctly predicted, that <i>whosoever
trusted in Him</i> should obtain the greatest blessings; for this is what he
means by <i>shall not be ashamed</i>, such as hope, and then fail in their
expectations being ashamed. Having thus gently touched them, again he exhibits

spake indeed concerning the law, teaching the Jews, that without labour on
their own part they had received the knowledge of what they ought to do, and
needed neither an ascent into heaven, nor a descent into Hades. <i>The word is
nigh thee</i>, for the knowledge of what thou shouldest do has been given unto
thee; but the holy apostle has transferred them to this account of faith,
teaching us that we should not over- curiously inquire into the dispensation in
Christ Jesus, or question that the only-begotten Son of God did become
incarnate, and having endured the passion, brought in the resurrection; but by
faith reap the salvation (offered). <i>For the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth,
and in thy heart;</i> and then he adds, <i>that is, the word of faith, which we
preach</i>. What Moses once said of the injunctions of the law, that we now say
of faith: </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</i>.
For both are necessary, a sound and firm faith, and a confession uttered with
boldness; that both the heart may be adorned with a certain persuasion of
faith, and the tongue dignified with a fearless proclamation of the truth. And
then again he adduces the testimony of Scripture. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</i> The salvation of men
is what he here <a name="p153"><font color="#000000">|153</font></a> calls <i>the riches of God</i>, for he
well knew the loving-kindness of the Lord; and most aptly does he suit his
testimonies to the heart, and to the tongue; to <i>the heart</i>, the <i>whosoever
believeth on Him shall not he ashamed</i>; to <i>the tongue</i>, the <i>whosoever
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved</i>. And then he shows that
the Jews had voluntarily deprived themselves of salvation, by not choosing to
receive the gospel offered, while yet he puts not forth this proof nakedly, but
brings about the argument in a different way. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

and then <i>call</i> upon God; but it is impossible for any one <i>to believe</i>
who <i>has not</i> enjoyed instruction, and this no one can obtain without
there being <i>teachers</i>, and these again <i>commission constitutes</i>.
Having laid down these positions as it were in vindication of the Jews, by them
he increases the blame lying on them. And that which is first, (in order of
time) namely, the <i>sending forth of preachers</i>, he puts last, as being
about to show, that of old all this had been foretold; for it would have been
in the common course to have set forth this before saying the rest, it being
necessary first that preachers be appointed,<sup>5</sup> then that they should
preach, then that men should hear their preaching, and lastly believe.
Therefore he adduces the prophecy of Isaiah, (lii. 7,) and says, <i>How
beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad
tidings of good things</i>! for the Lord bade His apostles, when entering into
a house to say, "Peace be to this house" (Luke x. 5), for they were
proclaiming the divine reconciliation, and bringing glad tidings of the
enjoyment of good things. The <i>feet</i> of such then he calls <i>beautiful</i>,
as running a goodly course; as washed by the hands of the Lord Himself. And

Acts of the Apostles, (ch. xiii. 40,) "It was necessary that the word of

called foolish, pointing out the folly we laboured under before our conversion

ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers
lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one

And at that time also, says he, were there many of Israel, and all were called
Israel, and yet the God of all things designated Himself the God of seven
thousand (only), and all the rest He rejected; for I have left unto Myself,
said He, <i>seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal</i>;
and this indeed the prophet knew not, but imagined that in himself alone was
preserved what remained of true piety. No new nor inconceivable thing then is
it, if you also know not those among you who have fixed their faith in the
Saviour, whom the God of all things acknowledges as His <i>people</i>. And most
opportunely does he bring forward the great Elias making this accusation
against them, that not only had they slain the prophets, but even overthrown
the altars from their foundations; for granting, says he, that they were
evilly-disposed towards the prophets, as denouncing bitter things against them,
what had they to allege against the divine altars? Rather then by such daring

this the prophet has yet more clearly shown, (ch. vi. 10, LXX., as also so

gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they

For to them first, such as believed among them brought the saving gospel, and
when they set themselves against it, and refused to receive their teaching,
then to the Gentiles did they offer the divine gospel; but they that believed
obtained salvation. And this was suited to prick in heart the gainsayers among
the Jews, and excite them to emulation, and so gain for them a participation in

For if, when the greater number disbelieved, those that were converted among

is it, that if all believed, they would become the means of yet greater

turns his exhortations to those among the Gentiles who had believed, and
counsels them to entertain a chastened view of themselves; aiming at once at a
double point, on the one hand to pull down all self-sufficiency on their part,

for so the Lord also said, "and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached unto all nations for a witness unto them, and then shall the end
come," (Matt. xxiv. 14). And all this we must recollect the holy apostle
says, from a desire to suit his matter exactly to the subject in hand, and
teach humility to those among the Gentiles that had believed, hold out the

also, infidelity having altogether severed them from, and faith exactly, as in
the case of the Gentiles, connecting them with, the root. For God is able to
graft them in again. By mentioning the power of God, he shows the ease with
which this would be done; and gives an instance, not one removed far from them,

as witnesses to this; and says, </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be

show that not all had disbelieved, for many even among them had believed; and
he bids them not despair of the salvation of the rest. For when the Gentile
nation shall have received the gospel, then they also shall believe, the great
Elias having come<sup>9</sup> and brought instruction in the faith to them, for

the Jews likewise, as having enjoyed yet more instruction, in that in addition
to nature and the creation, they had received the prophets also teaching what

time both these and those, thus deserving total destruction, has He blessed
with the privilege of salvation, provided only they were willing to believe.

Arians and Eunomians say is the Father, they will find the <i>through whom</i>
joined to the <i>of whom</i>; and if, on the other, they refer it to the Son,
they will see then the <i>of whom</i> connected to the <i>through whom</i>. If
then the <i>of whom</i> implies any superiority, and the <i>through whom</i>
any inferiority, and yet both are spoken of the same Person, He must in all
reason be considered greater than Himself, on account of the <i>of whom</i>,
and less than Himself on account of the <i>through whom</i>. Let us then,
leaving such (arguers) for the present, magnify our Creator and Saviour, to whom
belongs glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a name="p617"><font color="#000000">|617</font></a> </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

And already before had he exhorted to make "their members instruments of

are alive from the dead," (ch. vi. 13;) and here he bids these become also
a <i>sacrifice</i>, and calls it a <i>living</i> sacrifice, for it is not to be
slain that he commands the body,<sup>15</sup> but to become dead to sin, and
not be open to its action; and such sacrifice he speaks of as <i>holy</i>, <i>reasonable</i>,
and <i>acceptable</i>, as contrasting it with the oblation of irrational
animals, and showing that with this the Lord is pleased. For by ail the
prophets, as one may say, he finds fault with the sacrifices of beasts, while
he enjoins this; for "sacrifice," says he, "unto God the sacrifice
of praise," and "the sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me." Ps.

things of this present world, such as wealth, and power, and other like pomps,
by fashions, future things being substances, as alone permanent and satisfying;
for so in another place also, (1 Cor. vii. 31,) "for the fashion of this
world passeth away." For many from the height of abundance have fallen
into the extremest poverty, and others sprung from the lowest parents become
entrusted with the noblest offices of authority; and some again who elevated an
haughty brow, and enlarged themselves in pride, conceiving themselves superior
to everybody, being suddenly carried off, have become ill-savoured dust. The
holy apostle therefore desires us not to gape after these things, nor to love
the fashion of this world, but to seek those things which advance the life
eternal. <i>But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may
prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God</i>. He
exhorts here those also who were inclining to the worse to return again to the
better, as the word <i>transformed</i> shews. And he teaches how great is the
difference between virtue and mere present objects, by calling them <i>fashions</i>,
but virtue a <i>form</i>, for a <i>form</i> indicates actually existing
objects, but a <i>fashion</i> that which quickly melts away. And he points out
the freedom of will which the soul possesses, by commanding it both to <i>renew
the mind</i>, and to discriminate the better from the worse; for these things
are what he says serve God; and he marks out what these are; and first of all
he denounces arrogance, and enjoins humility. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." And

and shown his just judgments, for so the <i>Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,

to us, repaying with the reverse those that do evil to us, and ministering to
the wants of those that hate us. For these things weave a crown to such as thus
meekly and patiently endure,<sup>22</sup> while they increase the punishment of
the injurers. Not indeed that we are to suppose (that he means) that on this
account we are to minister to our enemies, in order that they may suffer the
heavier retribution hereafter, for the holy Apostle thus speaks from a wish to
repress the anger of the injured party, not from a desire by (his) good to
increase (the other's) evil. For that it is such a patient endurance which he
inculcates, what follows shews; <i>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil
with good</i>. For to revenge oneself proves defeat, while the returning good
for evil is manifest victory. Having thus disciplined (their) morals, he
exhorts them also to render to those in authority the honour due; for he
foresaw, as one who had plenteously received of the grace of the thrice holy
Spirit, how some, led rather by self-arrogance than any holy zeal for religion,
would despise their earthly rulers, as conceiving themselves far superior to
them by reason of their (better spiritual) knowledge.<sup>23</sup> And
especially does he do this, that he may blot out the opinion prevalent concerning
them; for they were falsely represented as destroyers of the common laws; and
some said, (Acts xvii. 6,) "These that have turned the world upside down
are come hither also;" and others that they were introducing "new
customs" (Acts x. 20); wherefore he thought it worth while to lay down his

well-being, ordained some to govern, and some to be governed, imposing the fear
of the magistrate to serve as a bridle on evil doers. But we must observe, that
it is the ordinance of ruling and being ruled, which the holy Apostle derives
from the providence of God, and not (so much) the elevation of this or that
specific individual to power; for it is not (so much) the sway of the unjust,
but the constitution of the office itself which is of God's appointment. And
yet, when kindly-disposed towards any, He gives them rulers who respect and
keep justice, for "I will give them," says He, "pastors
according to Mine heart, which shall feed them with knowledge" (Jer. iii.
15); and again, "I will give your judges as at the first, and your

depart from evil deeds. And what these are he goes on to specify. <i>Not in

Having thus in its turn fully spoken of practical virtue, he now returns again
to doctrinal instruction. And here it is first necessary to explain the scope
of the Apostle's arguments, that the exposition of what he says may be more
clearly understood. The Gentile believers, then, embraced the polity prescribed
by the gospel; while many of the Jews who had become proselytes to the gospel,
persisted still in submission to the institutions of the law, keeping still to
the observation of particular days, and partaking of such food (only) as the
law directed. Hence a disunion arose, and indeed positive quarrels, these latter
condemning the Gentile believers for their indiscriminate use of all foods, and
the former despising them in their turn on account of their extreme and
superfluous adherence to the law. To correct all this, therefore, the holy
Apostle offers such admonitions as are suited to both parties; and first he
exhorts the Gentile believers to brotherly love. <a name="p729"><font color="#000000">|729</font></a> </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Him that is of power to stablish you</i>; and after what manner to stablish? <i>according

and pointing out the antiquity of that preaching, he adds, <i>according to the
revelation of the mystery</i>; for not now is the mystery framed, but now is it
made known, having been long concealed; for so he goes on to say, <i>which was
kept secret since the world began</i>; and then he brings forward also the
witnesses of this preaching, <i>but now is made manifest and by the scriptures
of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God</i>; for
what He had darkly foreshown in the prophets, these things has the Maker of all
ages now clearly displayed; and what is the fruit of this preaching? <i>for the
obedience of faith</i>, for it behoves them that hear to believe what is
preached; and who are they? <i>made known to all nations</i>. Thus it is to be
understood, <i>according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, made
known to all nations</i>. <i>To God only wise, through Christ Jesus, to whom be
glory for ever, Amen.</i> Having set forth the mystery of the dispensation, of
old indeed fore-appointed, and then predicted in the prophets, and afterwards
become manifest indeed, he magnifies the wisdom of God, and utters forth a
doxology suitable thereto. But if the heretics should assert that God (the
Father) is here called <i>the alone wise</i>, let them know that the Lord
Christ is not only so called <i>wise</i>, but wisdom itself. (Prov. iii.
19,&amp; c.) And if indeed they think it right to deprive the Son of this name
of <i>wise</i>, so neither let them call Him immortal, for the same Apostle
says of God, "who alone hath <a name="p733"><font color="#000000">|733</font></a> immorlity." (1
Tim. vi. 16).<sup>35</sup> But leaving such to their own folly, let us proceed
onwards in our course. Having then thus offered up these supplications for
them, the holy Apostle adds exhortations, giving praise to the Gentile
converts, and designating them as <i>strong</i>, by reason of their faith.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

sign of his kindred, that the truth of the divine promise might be clearly manifested,
and the Gentiles receiving that grace might magnify Him, from whom the
loving-kindness has flowed to them. And then he adduces scriptural testimonies,

contemplating the madness of the Jews, he begs also for their prayers not only

words to the evil advocates of the law, whose precepts he bids them to avoid,
while praising the teaching of the chief of the Apostles; for the expression
causing such <i>contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned</i> is that of
one who greatly admires the doctrine they had already obtained. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

commanded them to be on their guard against their enemies, most opportunely

Having pointed out the enemy, he next points out the Helper, for they that have
obtained the divine grace possess that which is invincible. </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

those two epistles. And of Jason also the history of the Acts makes mention

even to the very teachers of the whole world; for by <i>host </i>he means
entertainer.<sup>50</sup> And he was a Corinthian, as the holy Apostle also
teaches us in his epistle to the Corinthians, "I thank my God," says
he, "that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius." (ch. i. 14).
<i>Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.</i>
He calls him not the <i>treasurer</i> of the church, but <i>of the city,</i> as
one fully entrusted with some charge; and he makes mention of him who in the
epistle to Timothy, thus speaking, (2 Ep. iv. 20), "Erastus abode at
Corinth, but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick." </span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

may rise superior to all snares; that by it enlightened we may without turning
aside tread the strait road, and following in the Apostolic footsteps be deemed
worthy to behold the teacher himself, and by his means <sup>51</sup> enjoy the
favour of the Lord, and obtain the promised blessing, through the grace and
loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; with whom, to the Father, together

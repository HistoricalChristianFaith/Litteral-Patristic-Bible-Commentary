says Paul, "the wrath of God on all impiety,” etc., which Solomon alluded
to speaking about the wise men of the world, when he said: “If so much has been
their science, that they have been able to deepen their knowledge of the world,
how is it that they have not been able to discover their Creator and Lord with
much less effort?” (Wis. 13:9) To those whom Solomon refers, they did not know
the Creator through the creature; on the other hand, those whom the Apostle
rebuked, they came to know him, but they did not give him thanks, and calling
themselves wise, they turned out to be fools who fell into the cult of idols.
(Cf. Rom. 1:21-23) Clearly the same Apostle says in the discourse to the
Athenians that wise Gentiles came to discover the Creator: “Because in him we
live, move and exist,” adding: “as one of yours has affirmed.” (Acts 17:28) His
first intention was to denounce the impiety of the Gentiles, to prove from here
that Gentiles by conversion could also achieve grace. It would be unfair to
suffer the punishment of his impiety and not receive the prize of faith.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

have occurred to them to even attribute anything to themselves. That is why the
Lord abandoned them to the desires of their heart, with which they came to act
in their own harm.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Because when someone goes looking for the pleasure of offensiveness, it becomes
crime when trying to remove whoever gets in the way. Distinguishing well that

offensiveness, it says: “Let us stalk the poor righteous man, who is

him by observing the Law, because by the Law comes the conscience of sin.” This
affirmation and other similar ones, which some take as offenses against the
Law, must be read with great care, not whether it gives the impression that the
Apostle despised the Law or annulled human freedom. Let us distinguish well
these four states in which man can be found: before the Law, under the Law,
under grace, in peace. We follow the desires of the flesh. Under the law we are
dragged by it. Under grace we neither follow it nor be dragged by it. In peace
there are no longer carnal desires. So before the Law we do not fight, since we
not only follow our passions and fall into sin, but we give our approval to
sin. Under the Law we fight, but we are defeated; we recognize the evil of our
actions, and this recognition leads us not to want to put them into practice;
but since grace is still absent, we are defeated. In this state it is clear to
what degree of prostration we arrive, and when trying to resurface and,
nevertheless, to fall again, our suffering is aggravated. That is why in this
Letter it is said: “The Law was inserted in order for crime to abound.” (Rom.
5:20) And also in another paragraph: “By the Law came the conscience of sin.”
This is not the remission of sin, since sin is only eliminated by grace. Good
is the Law, since it prohibits what should be prohibited, and sends what must
be done. But when one believes that he can fulfill it with his own forces,
dispensing with the grace of the Liberator, such pretension avails him nothing;
indeed, it harms him to the point that he is the victim of a stronger
inclination to sin, finding himself again guilty of his sins. “Because where
there is no law, there is no transgression.” (Rom. 4:15) When one becomes aware
of the degree of prostration in which he is submerged, and that by himself he
is not able to get up, he implores the help of the Liberator. It is then that
grace comes with the remission of past sins, helps those who try to resurface,
grants love to justification, and thus all fear disappears. When this takes place
while we are still in this life, some desires of the flesh continue to fight
against the spirit, to induce them to sin. But since the spirit does not give
them consent, because it is rooted in the grace and love of God, it stops
sinning. For it is not the bad inclination in itself that causes sin, but the
giving of our consent. Here comes what the Apostle himself says: “Let no more
sin reign in your mortal being by giving obedience to his wishes.” (Rom. 6:12)
It makes clear with this recommendation that, although there are in us these
crooked desires, not following them, we prevent sin from reigning in us. Now,
such desires have their origin in the mortality of our flesh, inherited from
the sin of the first man, of whom we are corporally descended. And this
inheritance will not end except when we deserve, in the resurrection of the
bodies, that immortality that is promised to us, where there will be a perfect
peace, once we have arrived at the fourth state. Peace will be perfect, nothing
will oppose us, by not opposing ourselves to God. This is what the Apostle
affirms: “The body, it is true, is dead because of sin, but the spirit lives by
justification. And if the Spirit who resurrected Jesus from the dead dwells in
you, he who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will also vivify your mortal
bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.” (Rom. 8:10-11) In the first man
there was perfect freedom. In us, however, before grace there is no freedom to
not sin, but only to not want to sin. On the other hand, grace obtains not only
an honest will, but that which can be put into practice, not by our strength,
but by the help of the Redeemer, who will also grant us, in the resurrection, a
perfect peace, a consequence of the good will. “Glory, then, to God in the
highest and peace on earth to men of good will.” (Luke 2:14)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

words: “Sin was not imputed when the Law did not exist.” It does not say that
it did not exist, but that it was not imputed. When the Law was promulgated, it
does not mean that the sin disappeared, but that it began to be imputed, that
is to say to manifest. We do not believe, then, that even the Law pretends to

a double meaning; one can be: for a crime such as that of Adam, death reigned,
since even those who had not sinned had death over them, because of their
origin in Adam's mortality. Or if not, we must certainly understand it like
this: Death reigned even in those who had not sinned with a crime like Adam's,
but who sinned before the Law. Their sin must be understood similar to that of
Adam, since they had received and a law, and Adam also sinned after receiving a
mandatory law. The words until Moses, should be understood as the entire period
of the validity of the Law. When Adam is called figure of the one who had to
come, is in the opposite direction: just as by Adam came death, so also by our

forgiveness was not so. In two ways forgiveness is superior: or that grace is
much more abundant, because of it we can enjoy eternal life, while the death
that reigned because of Adam was temporary; or that many suffered the
punishment of death for the sole sin of Adam, while through our Lord Jesus
Christ we receive the forgiveness of many sins with the gift of grace, which
leads us to eternal life. This second difference explains it thus: And there is
no ratio between one who committed the sin and the donation granted. “Because
the judgment of one alone ended in condemnation, while the gift of grace over
many crimes ended in justification.” One is only understood by the context that
is "a single crime", since immediately afterwards it adds expressly:
the gift of grace over many crimes. Here, therefore, the difference: the
sentence of Adam was for a single crime; On the other hand, for the Lord, the
forgiveness of many came to us. In the following paragraph Paul maintains these
two differences. This explains: “Because if by the crime of only one death
reigned through one man, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and
justice, living reign by the work of only one, Jesus Christ.” Words much more
reign, they refer to eternal life, and the others who receive the abundance of
grace, make reference to the forgiveness of many sins. After clarifying these
differences, he returns to the point of departure, which he had interrupted,
when he said: “Just as sin entered into this world through one man, and death
through sin.” (Rom. 5:12) Now connects with the above and continues: “So, just
as the crime of one alone was condemned for all men, so the justification of
one alone served as justification and life for all men. Just as by the
disobedience of one man many sinners became sinners, so also by the obedience
of only one many will become righteous.” Here we have the figure of the Adam
that was to come, from which he had just begun to speak, and interspersed some
differences, cut the thread of the speech. But now he picks it up and concludes
by saying: “So, the same as the crime of one alone to all men,” etc...</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

more abound.” In this sentence it is clearly understood that the Jews did not
understand with what design the Law was promulgated. It was not given to be
able to give them life. It is grace that vivifies through faith. The Law was
given to make clear how many and how close bonds of sins were going to be
chained to those who presumed to achieve justice by their own strength. In
these circumstances, sin proliferated, as concupiscence for prohibition became
more ardent, and in addition sinners were added to the crime of transgression
against a law. This will be well understood by the one who reflects on the
second state of those four that we have mentioned before.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

crucifixion of the old man is signified in the cross of the Lord, as the
renewal of the new man is in the resurrection. It is evident that we act
according to the old man, who was cursed. No one doubts that this curse refers
to sin itself, but it also reaches the Lord, who bore our sins, (Cf. Isa.
53:11) and God made him sin for us, (Cf. 2 Cor. 5:21) and that from sin he
obtained the condemnation of sin. (Cf. Rom. 8:3) What does it mean: “Destroying
the sinful body?” He himself makes it clear to us: “That we may no longer be
servants of sin;” and also when it says: “If we have died with Christ,” that
is, “if we have been crucified with Christ.” In another place it is expressed

sin. (Cf. Rom. 7:25) For he no longer pays attention to the desires of sin,
although he still asks for his inclinations and provokes his consent, something
that will continue to happen until the vivification, even corporal, comes and
death is annulled in victory. (Cf. 1 Cor. 15:54) By not consenting to the
perverse desires, we are already under grace, and sin no longer reigns in our
mortal being. (Cf. Rom. 6:12) This man, already established under grace,
describes it very well when he says: “Those of us who are dead to sin, how are

married woman is subject to the law as long as the husband lives. If her
husband dies, she is exempted from the law that bound her husband,” etc. We
note that this comparison differs from the subject for which she was brought
up, since here the death of the husband is discussed, with which the woman,
free from the law of the marriage bond, you can marry whoever you want. There,
on the other hand, the soul is considered as a woman, and her husband as the
sinful passions that operate in the members, to obtain the fruit of death, that
is, that the born offspring is worthy of such union. And the Law was not
promulgated to erase sin or free from it, but to show the sin before grace
came, which made those who were subject to the Law fall into a more burning
desire to sin, even to become most guilty of transgression. In this parallelism
three symbols are expressed: the soul, which would be the woman; the sinful
passions, represented by man, and the Law, represented by the law that unites
the woman with the husband. It is not said in this passage that the soul is
freed from death or forgiven sins as from a dying husband: on the contrary, it
is the soul itself who dies to sin and is free to belong to another husband,
that is, to Christ. She has died to sin, although still the same sin gives the
impression of being alive, which happens when the various inclinations that
incite us to sin remain in us, although we ignore them and do not indulge them
in our spirit, since we are dead to sin. At last the same sin will die, when
the transformation of our body arrives in the resurrection, of which it speaks
shortly thereafter: “It will also vivify your mortal bodies by the Holy Spirit

force before there are prohibitions. But when the prohibition comes, and, as we
have said, grace is lacking, it grows in such a way that it becomes total in
its kind, in other words, it reaches its culmination, turning against the Law
on the one hand, and adding the crime of transgression, on the other.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that rebels against the law of my reason, and makes me a prisoner of the law of
sin that is in my members.” This law of sin is that which keeps us chained in
the bonds of the habits of the flesh. This law fights against his spirit and
holds him captive under the law of sin, a clear proof that St Paul here
describes the state of the man who is not yet under grace. <i>(I Retract. 23)</i></font><font size="3"> If only the carnal inclination rebelled, but
without making it a prisoner, there would be no place for condemnation.
Condemnation comes because we obey and submit to the perverse instincts of the
carnal man. If such instincts continue in us, and continue to insist, but we
ignore them, then we are not prisoners: we are already living under grace. He
will speak of it when he begins to exclaim, imploring the help of the
Liberator, so that love, by grace, will be able to accomplish what fear could
not through the Law. Here are his words: “Woe to me! Who will deliver me from
the body of this death?” He adds: “The grace of God through Jesus Christ, our
Lord.” And then begins to describe the man established under grace, who
occupies the third state of those four in which we divide it above. To this
degree belongs what it says next: “I myself, on the one hand, serve the Law
with my reason, but on the other, with my flesh, I submit to the law of sin.”
That is, although the carnal instincts continue to be active, he consents them,
and therefore he does not submit to them committing sin. Because he is
established under grace, his spirit submits to the Law of God, even though his
flesh follows the law of sin. It calls the law of sin to the mortal condition,
derived from the sin of Adam, which makes us all mortal. As an inheritance of
this fall of the flesh, carnal desires are always inciting; to this it refers
in another passage: “We were also by nature children of anger, like others.”

Apostle says: “What the Law found impossible because of the weakness of the
flesh, God has achieved, sending his Son in a condition similar to sinful
flesh, and since sin gave condemnation in his flesh to sin, and thus the justice
demanded by the Law was fulfilled in us, that we no longer live according to
the carnal instincts, but according to the spirit.” His teaching is clear: the
same precepts of the Law, although they were obligatory, they were not
fulfilled. Why? Because those to whom the Law had been promulgated, before the
period of grace, were given over to material goods, and their desire was to
achieve happiness from them, just as their fears arose only when some danger
was coming against such goods. Therefore, when a problem arose in such temporal
goods, they easily departed from the fulfillment of the Law. It was, then,
logical that the Law should be weakened, since it was not fulfilled in its
precepts, not by its fault, but by the flesh, that is to say, of those men,
whose desires were not the love for justice that the Law inculcates, but the
craving for material goods. In a word: they put temporal comforts before the
Law. And then it is when our Liberator, the Lord Jesus Christ, arrives who
takes a mortal body in the likeness of the flesh of sin. The flesh of sin has a
debt: death. But let it be clear that the death of the Lord was a generous
dignity of his, not the payment of a debt. However, the Apostle calls
"sin" the assumption of mortal flesh, even if it is not sinful, since
an immortal, when he dies, is as if he committed a sin. That is why he says:
“But since sin he gave condemnation in his flesh to sin.” This is the
attainment of the Lord's death, so that we no longer fear death, and for the
same reason we did not desire temporal goods, nor did we fear temporal evils.
Here was where that "prudence of the flesh" resided that prevented
them from fulfilling the precepts of the Law. Once this prudence has been
destroyed and annulled in that man who was the Lord, the fulfillment of the law
of justice reigns, that one does not proceed according to the carnal instincts,
but according to the spirit. Hence, those words are really loaded: “I have not
come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it.” (Matt. 5:17) And also: “Charity is
the fullness of the Law.” (Rom. 13:10) And charity is in those who live
according to the spirit. She enters fully into the sphere of the grace of the
Holy Spirit. But when there was no love for justice, but only fear, the Law had
no fulfillment.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

enemy, let's not think of someone who is dealing with some being from an
adverse principle, not created by God, and who is dedicated to making war
against God. No. Enemy of God is called the one who does not abide by his law,
protected by the prudence of the flesh, which is like saying that his desires
are temporal goods, and his fears temporary evils. In fact, prudence is usually
defined as the search for good and the rejection of evil. The Apostle,
therefore, calls the prudence of the flesh to which he has as important goods
those who do not survive with man, and he is afraid of losing what he will irretrievably
lose. Such prudence is incapable of obeying the Law of God. Only when this
prudence disappears will the Law be obeyed. Then the prudence of the spirit
will happen to her: she makes our hope not reside in temporal goods, nor our
fear in evils. However, our very soul, in its unique nature, is in simultaneous
possession of the prudence of the flesh, when it goes after the goods of this
world, and of the prudence of the spirit, when it chooses the superior goods. Thus
the same water freezes by the cold and liquefies under the action of heat. St.
Paul declares, therefore, that "the prudence of the flesh is not subject
to the law of God, and that it cannot be," in the same sense that we say
that the snow is not heated and cannot but when it dissolves under the action
of heat and the water reaches a higher temperature, it can no longer be said
that it is snow.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

slaves, to fall back into fear, but a Spirit of adopted children, by which we
cry: Abba, Father!” The periods of the two Testaments are here clearly
distinguished: The Old, belonging to the age of fear, and the New, in which
charity reigns. But the question arises: What does "the spirit of
slavery" mean? Because the spirit of adoptive children undoubtedly is the
Holy Spirit, and therefore the spirit of slavery that makes one fall into fear
is one who has the power to kill. Throughout their lives they were reduced to
the bondage of fear those who lived under the Law and not under grace. And do
not be surprised that those who followed the temporal goods have received that
spirit of divine providence, not because of it comes the law and the precept.
“For the Law is holy and the commandment is holy, just and good;” (Rom. 7:12)
On the other hand, the spirit that reduces servitude there is no doubt that it
is not good. It is the one received by those who feel incapable of fulfilling
the promulgated Law, by submitting to low instincts and not yet being elevated
by the grace of the Liberator to the category of adopted children. In fact, the
spirit of servitude has no power over anyone, that is not assigned to him
according to the divine providence, which rewards each one according to the
justice of God. One such power had received the Apostle, when he refers to some
in these terms: “I gave them to Satan so that they learn not to blaspheme.” (1
Tim. 1:20) And another says: “I have already made the decision to surrender
that individual to Satan, to ruin his flesh and salvation of his soul.” (1 Cor.
5:3-5) Hence, those who do not yet live under grace, but who are established
under the Law, are constrained by sin to obey low passions, and with their
transgression they increase the guilt of their crimes. These have received the
spirit of slavery, that is, the spirit that has the power to cause death.
Because if by spirit of slavery we understood the same spirit of man, we would
have to understand by spirit of adoption that same spirit that has changed for
the better. But given that we have the Holy Spirit as the spirit of adoption,
as Paul openly testifies, when he says: “That same Spirit assures our spirit,”
the spirit of servitude is necessarily that of which sinners follow
inspirations. In the same way that the Holy Spirit delivers us from the fear of
death, so the spirit of servitude which exercises the power of death keeps the
sinners enslaved to this fear of death. The only way for all to escape is to
implore the help of the Liberator despite all the efforts of the devil who
wants to always have us in his power.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

vegetables or rocks or any other creatures of this type are capable of feeling
pain or complaining, here lies the Manichaean error, nor are we going to think
that holy angels are subject to this failure, and imagine that they are going
to be freed from inner servitude. No, they will never die anymore. We must
interpret all of creation, without forcing the text, contained in man alone.
That's right: every creature is necessarily or spiritually, that par excellence
is in the angels, or animal, which we all know is in the beasts or corporeal,
something that can be seen and touched. All of them are contained in man, which
consists of spirit, animal life and body. Then the sentence: "So the
creature awaits with a strong expectation the manifestation of the children of
God,” it has this meaning: everything that now in man is in misery and
subjected to corruption, is waiting for that manifestation of which the Apostle
speaks: “You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God; when your
life is revealed, which is Christ, then you too will manifest with him in
glory.” (Col. 3:3-4) John also says: "My beloved, we are now the children
of God, but what we will one day do not yet appear. We know that when he comes
in his glory, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is." (1
Jn. 3:2) This manifestation of children of God, is what awaits creation,
creation that for now in man is subject to failure, while being given to
temporary things, passing like a shadow. This is what the psalm says: “Man is
like a breath, his days pass like a shadow.” (Ps. 143:4) Solomon also speaks of
this void of creation in these terms: “Vanity of vanities, everything is
vanity. What does a man get out of all his hardships with which he struggles
under the sun?” (Songs 1:2-3) And David still says again: “Why do you follow
the fancy of the useless and seek the lie?” (Ps. 4:3) He does not say that the
creation has submitted on its own to that uselessness, since it is a punishment
imposed. If it is true that man sinned freely, it was not he who chose the
punishment. Yes, this punishment was imposed on our nature, but not without
hope of redemption. That's why Paul says: “By the work of the one who submitted
it, but with hope, because that same creation will be freed from the bondage of
death to achieve the freedom and glory of the children of God.” It is about
what is only creature, not yet added by faith to the number of the children of
God, but in the group of those who were to believe. The Apostle, when
contemplating them, was when he said that the creation will be freed from the
bondage of death, so that they are no longer under the tyranny of destruction
to which all sinners submit. Because that is how the sinner was sentenced: “You
will die without remedy.” (Gen. 2:17) But also: “She will be liberated with the
glorious freedom of the children of God,” that is, so that she too, the
creation, will come to enjoy the freedom and glory of the children of God
through faith. And when that faith still did not possess her, she was simply
called a pure creature. The following is precisely what she refers to: “Because
we know that the creation sends moans of pain to the present.” It would be time
for those who, even in their spirit, were subject to regrettable mistakes, to
pass to faith. And so that no one would be called deceptive, believing that
with such words he was referring only to non-believers, he also adds some
considerations for those who had already embraced the faith. Although with the
spirit, that is, with reason, the Law of God is obeyed, nevertheless, since
with our passions one becomes a slave of the law of sin, (Cf. Rom. 7:25) while
we have to suffer the annoyances and incitements of our mortal being, therefore
the Apostle says: “Moreover, we too, who possess the first fruits of the
Spirit, groan in the depths of our being.” It is clear: not only, he says, in
what we can call merely a creature among men, for not have still believed, and
cannot be counted among the children of God, there are these groans and this
pain: we ourselves, who already have the faith and we have the Spirit as a
first fruits, that already in our spirit we are united to God by faith, and
therefore we stop calling ourselves pure creatures, to call ourselves children
of God, but we also make moans in our interior waiting for the adoption, the
redemption of our body. Because this adoption, already made in those who have
believed, it is done in the spirit, not in the body. The body has not yet
received that celestial transfiguration, as the spirit has achieved, which has
been renewed by the reconciliation worked by faith, turning from its errors to
God. Yes, also in those who are already believers it is waiting for that
manifestation that will take place with the resurrection of the bodies, and
that belongs to the fourth of the conditions of man. There will reign a perfect
peace and an endless rest: there will be no corruption that can resist us, nor
annoyance that causes us concern.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

helps our weakness, because we do not know what we need to ask.” It is evident
that the Apostle here speaks of the Holy Spirit, which he clearly indicates in
the following: "Because he asks for the saints what is according to
God." We, in reality, do not know how to pray properly, and this for two
reasons: first, because the future that we long for and toward which we tend is
not yet manifested; and then because in this our life there are many things
that may seem beneficial and harmful, and others that seem harmful to us and
are actually beneficial. For example, when suffering comes to a servant of God,
either as a proof or as a correction, the little understood ones find it
pointless. But if we pay attention to those words: “Give us your help in the
tribulation, because the salvation that comes from man is useless,” (Ps. 59:13)
we realize that there are many times that God helps us in our troubles, and
that it is useless to sigh for the health, when it may not suit us, because it
may be that it puts the soul in danger because of its passionate love for the
present life. This is what the words of the psalm refer to: “I encountered
tribulation and pain, and invoked the name of the Lord.” (Ps. 114:3-4) That I
found was something useful, since we were not happy to have found anything but
what we were looking for. That is why we do not know how to ask in prayer what
is convenient. God does know what is good for us in this life and what he will
grant us at the end of it. But the Holy Spirit in person intercedes for us with
ineffable groans. He says that the Spirit groans, and that is because it makes
us moan, stoking our love towards the desire for the future life. Hence those
words: “The Lord your God puts you to the test to know if you love him.” (Deut.
13:3) What he really wants is for you to know. There is nothing hidden from

before, it is evident that they are not justified if they are not called
before; But it is not about all the calls, but about those who have been called
according to God's plan, as he had said shortly before. And it's about God's
design, not theirs. Paul himself explains the scope of this design, when he
says: “For those whom he foreseen in advance, he also predestined them to be
like his Son.” No, not all those called are according to the divine plan; this
design is part of the foreknowledge and predestination of God. Well understood
that no one predestined, but the one whom he foresaw that he would believe and
be faithful to that vocation. It is these whom he calls elect. Because many are
called, but do not come to the call; on the other hand nobody comes if they are
not before called.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

how our Lord is only begotten in a different way than firstborn. As only Son,
he has no brothers, he is by nature the Son of God, the Word who was from the
beginning and by whom all things were made. (1 Jn. 1:1) He is called, on the
other hand, firstborn because he has been associated with other brothers,
something that took place when he assumed human nature in the mystery of the
incarnation. Thanks to he, he deigned to call us also his children, not
natural, but adopted. When we say that one is the first, we obviously say that
he is not alone, but that there are other brothers who follow him, after having
preceded them. For example, in another place he is called the firstborn among
the dead, so that it is he who maintains the primacy. (Cf. Col. 1:18) Indeed,
before him no death is resurrected to die no more; after him a great number of
saints, whom he does not blush to call his brethren, because of the humanity
which is common to them, have in part to this resurrection.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Apostle, and not simply I think, that is to say that his faith gives him a full
conviction, that neither the threat of death, whatever it is, nor the promise
of the present life, nor any of the things of which he enumerates, cannot
separate from the love of God the one who believes in him. No, no one turns it
aside: nor the one who threatens death, since whoever believes in Christ, even
if he dies, lives on; Neither does he who offers life, because he who gives
eternal life is Christ. There is no room for hesitation, since the promise of
temporary life becomes contemptible in comparison with eternal life. Nor does
it exclude the angel, since even when an angel, he says, descended from heaven
to announce something different from what you have received, let him be anathema.
Nor is the principality, the adversary, naturally, since he has stripped
himself of such principalities and powers, triumphing over them in himself.
(Cf. Gal. 2:15) Neither the present nor the future, it is understood temporary
things that can flatter or be difficult, that offer hope or instill fear.
Neither force, this force should be understood as adverse, according to these
other words of the Gospel: “No one can strip the hope chest of a strong man,
unless it is first tied,” (Matt. 12:29) neither height nor depth, or whose
discovery is useless, separates from God, unless charity prevails by inviting
men to certain knowledge of spiritual goods, whether from the sky or from the
abyss, that we are not capable of penetrating, and even if we do it, they are
useless. Unless the charity comes out victorious, it makes its impulse feel not
towards the inconsistent exterior, but towards the certain spiritual realities
that are in the inner man. “No creature whatsoever.” This can be understood in
two ways: either the visible creatures, since we, that is, our soul, is a
creature, but invisible, in which case I would say that no creature will
separate us, that is, no love of body type; or rather that there is no possible
creature that can separate us from the love of God, since no creature comes
between us and God, that is adverse and can prevent us from embracing it.
That's right, above the human mind, which is rational, there is no longer any
creature, only God.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

his eternity, he is the Word that already existed from the beginning, God
blessed on all and for always. As the Jews only maintained a part of this
profession of faith, it is because of what the Lord denies them. In fact, when
he asked them to see who they believed that the Christ should be a son, they
answered: David. (Cf. Matt. 22:42-43) This, of course, is according to the
flesh. But of his divinity, for which he is God, nobody responded. And it is
when the Lord replies to them: “Then, how is it that David, inspired by the
Spirit, calls him Lord?” (Matt. 22:43) To make them realize that they had
confessed only that Christ is the son of David, and they had kept silent that
Christ, He is also Lord of David himself. The first is for his incarnation, and

choosing not by works, but because he calls, before being born and doing
something good or bad, he was told: “The elder will serve the younger, as it is
written: I loved Jacob and I rejected Esau.” Some are worried about these
words, thinking that Paul eliminates the free will of the will, for which we
deserve God through good and pious works and with the evil and impious we
offend him. And they reason saying that before any good or bad work, before
being born, one of the two had love and the other hatred. But our answer is
that God, by his foreknowledge, knows, before he is born, what each one will be
like. And here is where someone could object: Then God chose the works in which
he loved, although they still did not exist, because he foresaw that they would
be done. Well, if he chose the works, how is it that the Apostle Paul affirms
that the election was not made by the works? We have to understand this passage
like this: good works are done out of love, and love is present in us through
the gift of the Holy Spirit, as the Apostle himself says: “Charity has been
poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.” (Rom.
5:5) No one should, therefore, boast of the works as if they were his: they are
the fruit of a gift from God, since it is love that operates in him good works.
What, then, was what God chose? If it is he who gives the Holy Spirit to whom
he wills, thanks to which love works good in him, on what basis does God choose
to whom to give it? Because in the absence of all merit, there is no choice: we
are all equal before deserving, and we cannot talk about choice when things are
exactly the same. But since the Holy Spirit is given only to those who believe,
it means that God chose not works, but faith: works are a gift of God, the
fruit of charity that works in us good, which it comes with the gift of the
Holy Spirit. It is clear: if one does not believe in God, nor keep oneself in
the will to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, he does not receive it.
Because it is he who infuses us with charity, which enables us to do good. So
God, in his foreknowledge, does not choose works in anyone, which must be a
gift of his, but he chooses the faith: to whom he knows in advance that he has
to believe, he chooses, to give him the Holy Spirit, and by his means, with
well-doing, he can also attain eternal life. Thus says the Apostle himself: “It
is the same God who works all in all.” (1 Cor 12:6) But no Scripture says:
"God works to believe everything in everyone." Therefore believing is
our thing, and doing good is the work of the one who gives the Holy Spirit to
those who have believed in him. It was this point that was proposed to the Jews
who had believed in Christ, and they gloried in their works before receiving
the grace. They claimed to have received the grace of the Gospel for their good
works an example, being that good works are impossible without having received
grace. If he corresponds to this first grace by obeying the voice of the one
who calls him, which depends on his free will, he will deserve to receive the
Holy Spirit who will give him the power to do good, and if he persevering in
this state, which also depends on his free will, he will deserve eternal life,
which is safe from all corruption and defilement.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

whom I will have compassion, and I will have mercy on whom I will please to
have pity." This phrase clarifies that in God there is no injustice,
something that some may object to this other: “Before they were born, I loved
Jacob, and instead I rejected Esau.” So he says: “I will have compassion on
whom I have compassion.” First, while we were still sinners, God has compassion
on us and called us. And then, as he says, who I pity for, calling him, I will
again have pity for him when he creates. How is it that we say
"again", but because the Holy Spirit gives it to the one who
believes, and also asks for it? And once granted to anyone who shows his mercy,
he will continue to offer it, until he becomes merciful, with which he is
capable of doing good for love. That no one should think, then, to attribute to
himself the works he performs of mercy. It is God who, through the Holy Spirit,
has granted him love, without which no one can be merciful. God has not chosen
those who do good, but rather those who believe, to make possible the practice
of good. It is up to us to believe and to want, but it is up to God alone to
give those who have faith and good will the power to do good by the Holy Spirit,
who spreads charity in our hearts to render us merciful. <i>(I Retract., 23. 3)</i></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

wanting or worrying, but God has mercy.” This phrase does not eliminate the
free will of our will. He limits himself to saying that it is not enough for us
to want it, if God does not help us by making us merciful in order to do good,
by the gift of the Holy Spirit. This is what has been said a short time before:
"I will have pity on whom I will please to have pity, and I will have
mercy on whom I will please mercy." It is that we cannot even want, if we
are not called; and when we want, after the call, our will and our efforts are
not enough, if God does not lend vigor to those who labor, and leads them to
the goal. It is clear that the thing, then, is not that one wants or cares for
us to work good, but that God has mercy, although here also our will is
implied, which by itself nothing can. St. Paul confirms this truth by a proof
from Pharaoh's retribution, when God says of him in Holy Scripture: "I
have caused you to stir up my power in you, and to make my name famous
throughout the world.” Indeed, we read in Exodus: "The heart of Pharaoh
was hardened to the point that the most brilliant prodigies made no impression
on him.” (Exod. 1:10) Now this disobedience of Pharaoh to God's orders was a
punishment. And no one can say that Pharaoh had not deserved this hardening of
the heart, for it was the just chastisement of which God punishes his unbelief.
He was not accused of not obeying at that moment, since with a hardened heart
he could not obey, but had become worthy of hardening by his previous
disbelief. The same thing happens with those God chooses: the principle of
merit is not works, but faith. Good works are a gift from God. And in a
parallel way it happens with those God condemns: it is infidelity and impiety
that is at the base of the deserved punishment; his bad deeds are already the
consequence of this punishment. Thus the Apostle affirms it above: And since
they did not recognize God as worthy of being known, he gave them to his
reprobate feelings, so that his conduct would be disordered. (Rom. 1:28) And
this is how the Apostle himself concludes: “Then he has compassion on whom he
wills, and on whomsoever he hardens him.” So it is: to him with whom he has
mercy, he causes him to do good works. On the other hand, whoever he hardens he
abandons so that he may give him up to bad deeds. Note that this mercy must be
attributed to the merit of the previous faith, just as the hardening is to the
previous impiety. The good work, then, is due to a gift from God, and evil to a
punishment. But man is not deprived of the free will of his will, either when
he believes in God to reach his mercy, or when he rejects God, thus falling into
punishment. When Paul came to this conclusion, he asks himself this question as
if he were from an adversary: “​​Now you will object to me: Why do you still
complain? Who can resist his will?” To this question he responds in a way that
we understand him as spiritual men, not as those who live according to earthly
criteria: it is evident that the first merits can be faith or impiety, and that
God, with his foreknowledge, chooses those who believe and reject unbelievers;
that he does not choose those for his works, nor does he condemn them for them;
that it is good for them to act for their faith, and for others to abandon them
to hardening in their unbelief, the cause of their evil deeds. Since this
explanation, as I have already said, is well understood by men of spirit, while
the prudence of the flesh is unacceptable, the refutation of the objector is
first directed at convincing him that in order to understand this he must first
divest himself of the man of clay, and thus deserves to carry out this
investigation through the ways of the spirit. Says Paul: “Oh man! Who are you
to reply to God? Will the clay tell the one who modeled it: Why did you make me
this way? Is it not for the potter to have the right to make a noble and a
despicable glass from the same clay?” As if to say: while you are being made
and you are a mass of clay, which has not yet reached the level of spiritual
realities; Until you become the spiritual man who judges everything and is
judged by no one, it is better for you to abstain from this kind of inquiry and
to reply to God. If one wishes to know his designs, he must first be received
in his friendship, something that can only be achieved by the spiritual ones,
who already carry in themselves the image of the heavenly man. It is he himself
who says: “I am no longer going to call you servants, but friends, because
everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.” (Jn. 15:15)
But as long as you are a fragile vessel of clay, that same fragility must be
broken in you with that rod of iron to which the psalm refers: “You shall rule
them with a scepter of iron, and as a vessel of clay you shall break them.”
(Ps. 2:9) And so, annihilated the outer man and renewed the interior; rooted
and grounded in charity, you will be able to understand the width and the
length, the height and the depth, getting to know also what surpasses all
knowledge, the love of God. (Cf. Eph. 3:16-19) Now, if God of the same mass has
made some honorable and other despicable vessels, you are not the one to
discuss it, you who are still part of this mass, which means that you have a
sense of earthly and carnal life.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Matt. 5:44) and even what the same Apostle said shortly before: “Bless those
who persecute you, bless them, yes, do not curse them” (Rom. 12:14); or also:
“Do ​​not repay evil for evil.” (Rom. 12:17) How can one love the one who gives
him food and drink, precisely to pile coals burning on his head, if the burning
coals mean in this text a serious punishment? No, it's not like that. We must
understand that these words are an invitation, with our good behavior towards
those who have offended us, to repent of their bad behavior. Such burning coals
are aimed at burning, that is, at the contrition of the spirit, which is like
the head of the soul, in which all malice is reduced to ashes, when man becomes
better by conversion. These are the coals of fire spoken of in the Psalms: “What
is going to be given to you, what is going to be offered to you, to your
deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of a warrior with scorching coals.” (Ps.

authorities; there is no authority that does not come from God.” It is an
opportune warning to the new Christians, lest they rise to the head to be
called by the Lord to freedom, and come to think that in the pilgrimage of this
life there is no reason to comply with the established order or submit to the
higher authorities, to whom only the government of transitory realities has
been temporarily granted. Being us, as we are, soul and body, while we are in
this temporal life we ​​make use of temporary things for the necessities of our
life. It is logical, therefore, that we submit, in relation to the realities of
present life, to the authorities, that is, to the men constituted in dignity,
who govern human realities. Now, as regards our faith in God and the call to
his kingdom, we do not have to submit ourselves to any man, when his intentions
are precisely to overthrow what God has given us in order to eternal life. If
someone, then, thinks that because he is a Christian he is not obliged to pay
the taxes or the contribution, or not to pay due honor to the authorities
responsible for these things, he is in serious error. But it would fall into a
more serious error even if he thought that the authorities invested with some
superior dignity should abide by the government of temporal realities, but
taking this to the field of faith, as if they also had authority over it. The
right balance in this field is prescribed by the Lord in person, when he says
that we must “give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to
God.” (Cf. Matt. 22:21) And although we are called to that kingdom, where there
will no longer be any authority of this world, as long as our pilgrimage lasts,
until we reach that world, where all principality and powers are annulled, let
us be tolerant with our condition, for the good order of the human realities.
Let us not walk with falsehood, and let us give obedience in all this not so
much to men, but to God who prescribes this behavior to us.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

cause irritation to some, when they remember that Christians have suffered
frequent persecution from the authorities. Were they not behaving well, not
only because they were not praised by such authorities, but even when they were
tortured and killed? We must consider well the words of the Apostle. He does
not say, "Be good and the authority will praise you," but: “Do good
and you will receive praise." That is to say, whether he persecutes you,
you will receive his approval, either because you succeed in conquering him in
the service of God, or because you deserve the crown of martyrdom in
persecution. The same can be deduced from what he says about authority
immediately: “He is at the service of God for your good,” (Rom. 13:2) even

wants to make us understand with this phrase that it is necessary, for the sake
of this life, to be submitted, without resisting even when they want to take
something away from our temporal things, within the limits of their authority.
As we are talking about temporary goods, our submission does not have to reach
the assets, say, permanent, but only those we need in this temporary life. The
Apostle, however, fears that these words may not be permitted: "Be
submissive by necessity" to obey only reluctantly and without true love,
and he hastens to add: "Not only by fear, but also by conscience," that
is to say, not only to avoid anger, which can be done by a simulated obedience,
but so that your conscience assures you that you act with love for the one to
whom you are subject by the command of the Lord, who wants all men to be saved
and to come to the knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim. 2:4) And when the Apostle
said this, he meant the legitimate authorities. This is what he advises the
slaves in another place: “Offer your service not only to be seen, as to please
men,” (Eph. 6:6) that in the very act of submitting to their masters, they do
so without bitterness and not to gain their favor by means of deceit.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

consists in love, that is to say, in charity. That is why the Lord says that
all the Law and the Prophets are included in these two precepts of love for God
and for one's neighbor. (Cf. Matt. 22:37-40) This is the reason why he himself,
who came to give fulfillment to the Law, gave us the love for the Holy Spirit
so that what the fear was not able to fulfill before, it would be achieved
later by charity. The same thing makes him say: “The fullness of the law is
charity.” And also: “The end of the mandate is charity, which springs from a
pure heart, an honest conscience and a sincere faith. (1 Tim. 1:5)</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is weak in the faith, that our strength is the support of his weakness and that
we do not seek to discuss his opinions, that is to say to make a judgment on
the thoughts of the heart of others, which we do not see. This is why he adds:
"One believes he can eat of all things, and the other, on the contrary,
weak in faith, only eats vegetables." Already at that time there were many
with firm faith, experts in the wisdom of the Lord, according to which does not
contaminate what enters the mouth, but what comes out of it, <span> </span></font><font size="3">and with all tranquility of conscience they
ate everything. There were others, weaker in their faith, who abstained from
flesh and wine, lest they should come across, without knowing it, with
something sacrificed to idols. At that time all the meat of the immolations was
sold in the marketplace, just as the first fruits of the wine made libations to
their idols, some of which were already made in the same wineries. Well, to
those who consumed these foods with a clear conscience the Apostle orders them
not to despise the others, who are weaker, who abstained from such food and
drink. In the same way, he tells them not to believe that they contract
impurity, who see no inconvenience in eating meat and drinking wine. The following
is true: “The one who eats does not judge,” that is, does not despise the one
who does not eat, and the one who does not eat, who does not judge the one who
eats. It was the case that the stronger Christians stubbornly despised the
weakest, and the weaker Christians judged the strong ones recklessly.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

a judgment on the heart of our brother whom we do not see. On the contrary, it
is these actions, which were evidently made with a vicious and culpable
intention, and which cannot be interpreted otherwise, we are not forbidden to
judge them. Thus, in the question of food, we do not know in what intention we
use it; he does not want us to be the judges, it is up to God to judge. On the
contrary, he commands us to judge as he deserves this abominable incest
committed by a son with his father's wife (Cf. 1 Cor. 5:1); for this man could
not excuse on the righteousness of his intention a crime so monstrous. Thus,
every action that bears with it such a character of evidence that it cannot be
said: I have done it with a good intention, we can judge it, but all those
whose motives and reason cannot be grasped. Let us beware of judging them and

the moment, some possible more accurate consideration, I believe that it is not

day is man, because he can judge today one way and tomorrow another; can today
condemn one as bad, convicted or confessed, and tomorrow it turns out that it
looks good, since it has been corrected. Or the other way around, today he
praises one as a good person, and tomorrow he seems a degenerate. But he who
judges every day is God, because he knows not only how each one is now, but how
he will be day after day. Then: “Everyone is sure of their way of thinking,”
says Paul. That is to say, each one arrives in his judgments to where it is
allowed to the human understanding, or to each man in particular. The one who
thinks one day, he continues, does it for the Lord, that is, what he judges
correctly today, he does for the Lord. The one who gives exact judgment only

to learn that there is never to despair of its correction.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

He wants with these words that the Gentiles understand that Christ the Lord was

rejected what was sent to them, it was then that they began to preach the
Gospel to the Gentiles. This is very clear in the Acts of the Apostles, when
they say to the Jews: “We had to announce the word to you first, but since you
do not consider yourself worthy, we go to the pagans.” (Acts 13:46) The same
Lord also testifies when he says: “I have not been sent except to the lost
sheep of Israel,” (Matt. 15:24) and in another place: “It is not right to throw
the children's bread out of the dogs.” (Matt. 15:26) If the Gentiles stop to
consider this, they will realize that this is their conviction, for which they
are sure that for those who are pure everything is pure, (Titus 1:15) it should
not lead them to mock those who are weaker, perhaps from the Jews, who dare not

some that they did not teach different doctrines, and that they did not deal
with fables and endless genealogies, that lend themselves more to arguments

teaching what is not due, for the sleazy desire to take money.” One of them,

<div><strong>(1) I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Let it not be! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. (2) God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? (3) "Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have demolished thy altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life." (4) But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." (5) So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. (6) But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. (7) What then? Israel failed to obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were blinded, (8) as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day." (9) And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution for them; (10) let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs for ever." </strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________ <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">After showing that the fall of the Jews is deplorable, though not entirely excusable [n. 813], the Apostle now shows that it is not universal.

So am I" (2 Cor 11:23). Furthermore, among the Jewish people the tribes were distinguished according to the sons of Jacob, some of whom were sons of slaves and some of wives. Joseph and Benjamin were sons of Rachel, Jacob's fondest wife. Hence he shows his eminence among the Jewish people, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">a member of the tribe of Benjamin</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin" (Phil 3:5).

For the entire Book of Kings was written mainly to make known the saying and deeds of the Prophets. That is why it is counted among the prophetic books, as Jerome says. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">How he pleads with God against Israel. </font></font></i><b><font size="3">866. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">The word of Samuel seems to be contrary to this when he says: "Far from me be this sin against the Lord, that I should cease to pray for you" (1 Sam 12:23). Much less, then, should one intervene against the people. But it should be noted that prophets intervene against the people in three ways: in one way by conforming their wills to the divine will revealed to them, as it says in Ps (58:10): "The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance." In another way by </font></font>433 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">intervening against the kingdom of sin, in order that men's sins but not men be destroyed. In a third way that the intervention or prayer be construed as a denunciation, as in Jer (17:18): "Let them that persecute me be confounded," i.e., they will be confounded. </font></font><b><font size="3">867. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In this intervention Isaiah alleges two things against them. First, the impiety they committed against the worship of god. First, by persecuting His ministers, to which he refers when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute?" (Ac 7:52); "Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord" (1 Kings 18:13). Secondly, impiety against God's holy places, as it says in Ps (74:7): "They set they sanctuary on fire." In regard to this he says: They have demolished thy altars. </font></font><b><font size="3">868. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Here it should be noted what the Lord commanded, saying: "You shall seek the place which the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make hi habitation there; thither you shall go, and thither you shall bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices" (Dt 12:5-6). However, before the temples was built, the people were allowed to build altars in various places for divine worship; but because this became illegal after the temple had been built, the pious king Hezekiah destroyed all such altars. And that is what it says in 2 Kgs (18:220 "Is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?" Therefore, what Hezekiah did in a spirit of piety, Achab and Jezebel did in a spirit of impiety in their desire to root out the worship of God entirely. </font></font><b><font size="3">869. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Thirdly [cf. n. 867], he alleges against them the impiety they intended to do, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and I alone am left</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, namely, to worship the one God, because the rest did not show very clearly that they were God's worshippers: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and they seek my life. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For Jezebel </font></font>434 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">had sent word to Elijah, saying: "so may the gods do to me, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them (1Kgs 19:2), namely of the prophets of Baal whom Elijah had killed. </font></font><b><font size="3">870. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then he gives the divine reply, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But what is God's reply to him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., to Elijah.

First, he sets out the adaptation, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">So, too, at the present time</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, in which a multitude of people seems to have gone astray, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">there is a remnant chosen by grace, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">saved according to the choice of God's grace: "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you" (Jn 15:16). Secondly, he draws the conclusion from this: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But if it is by grace </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">that they have been saved, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">it is no longer on the basis of works: </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">"He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy" (*** 3:5). Thirdly, that this conclusion follows from the premises is shown when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Otherwise, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">i.e., if grace is in virtue of works, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">grace would no loner be grace, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for it is given gratis: "The free gift of righteousness through his grace" (Rom 5:17). </font></font><b><font size="3">872. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">What then</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, he draws the conclusion he intended. </font></font>435 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">And first he sets it out, saying </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">What then </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">shall we say follows from what has been said?

For it says in Is (29:10): "The Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep." In regard to this he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">God gave them a spirit of compunction</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, which has to do with a perversity of emotion. For compunction implies a puncturing of the heart or sorrow. Hence there is good compunction by which ones grieves over his own sins, as it says in Ps 60(:3), "You have made us drunk with the wine of compunction." There is also evil compunction, i.e., the compunction of envy, by which one grieves over the goods of another. Therefore God gave them this spirit of compunction, i.e., envy, not by instilling malice but by withdrawing grace, as was said above (10:19): "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation." </font></font>436 <b><font size="3">875. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Likewise it says in Is (6:10): "Male the heart of this people fat, and their eyes heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears." In this vein he designates their weakened power of knowing, when he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">eyes that should not see </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the miracles which Christ performed in their presence, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and ears that should not hear </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">fruitfully the teachings of Christ and the apostle: "He sees many things but does not observe then, his ears are open, but he does not hear" (Is 42:20). To this the Apostle adds on his own: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">down to this very day, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">because they will see and hear at the end of the world, when the hearts of the children will be converted to the hearts of their fathers, as it says in Mal (4:5). </font></font><b><font size="3">876. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when hey says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">And David says, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">he presents the authority of David on the same point. First, he touches on the things which occasioned the fall of the Jews, saying" </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Let their table</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e. the malice with which sinners are nourished: "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue" (Jb 20:12).

In regard to this he does two things: first, he shows that the fall of the Jews is useful and reparable; secondly, he disputes the Gentiles' boasting against the Jews [v. 17; n. 894]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he asks a question; secondly, he answers it [v. 11b; n. 880]. </font></font><b>879. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: It has been stated and proved that except for the chosen, the rest of the Jews have been blinded. So the question arises: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Have they stumbled so as to fall? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">This can be interpreted in two ways: the first way is this: Has God permitted them to stumble only so as to fall, i.e., not for any benefit that might follow but merely willing their fall? This, of course, would be contrary to God's goodness which, as Augustine says, is so great that it would not permit any evil to occur except for some good, which He draws out of the evil. Hence it says in Jb (34:24): "He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead"; and in Rev (3:11): "Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown,": namely, because God permits some to fall in order that their fall be the occasion of salvation for others. Another interpretation is this: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Have they stumbled so as to fall? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., to remain fallen forever: "will he not rise again from where he lies?" (Ps 41:8). </font></font><b>880. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Let it not be! </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he answers the question: first, according to the second interpretation that it is reparable; </font></font>439 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">second, he resolves the question according to the second interpretation, showing that the Jews’ situation is reparable [883]. </font></font><b>881. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">By no means </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">was their fall useless; rather, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by their</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, the Jews', </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Hence the Lord Himself says: "Salvation is from the Jews" (Jn 4:22). This can be understood in three ways. In the first way, that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by their trespass, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">which they committed in killing Christ, the salvation of the Gentiles was obtained through the redemption of Christ's blood: "you know that you were ransomed not with perishable things, such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of the Lamb" (1 Pt 1:18). In the second way, it can be understood of the trespass by which they rejected the teaching of the apostles, with the result that the apostles preached to the Gentiles, as it says in Ac (13:46): "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, we turn to the Gentiles." In a third way it can be understood as meaning that on account of their impenitence they have been scattered among all the nations. As a result Christ and the Church had from the books of the Jews testimony to the Christian faith helpful in converting the Gentiles, who might have suspected that the prophecies concerning the testimony of the Hews; hence it says in Ps 59 (v.10): "Let me look in triumph on my enemies," i.e., the Jews. "Slay them not, lest my people forget, make them totter by thy power." </font></font><b>882. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">There follows </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">so that they may be jealous of them</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font>440 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And because he does not say who or whom, and since there are two kinds of jealousy, namely that of indignation and that of imitation, this phrase can be explained in four ways. The first way is this. The Gentiles are jealous of </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">them</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely the Jews, such that they imitate them in the worship of the one God: "You were at one time without Christ, alien to the way of life of Israel," and later he adds, "But now you, who were once far off, have been drawn near in the blood of Christ" (Eph 2:12); "You have become imitators of the Church of God" (1Th 2:14), which was in Judea. Or it can be interpreted this way. The Gentiles are jealous of the Jews, i.e., they are indignant against them on account of their unbelief: "I beheld the transgressors and I pined away, because they do not keep your words" (Ps 118:158). Thirdly, it can be understood in this way. The Jews are jealous, i.e., imitate the Gentiles when everywhere, and now some of them particularly, are converted to the faith, imitating the faith of the Gentiles; and in the end all Israel will be saved when the fullness of the Gentiles have entered. Thus will be fulfilled what is said in Dt 28(:44), "He will be the head and you will be the tail." Fourthly, it can be interpreted this way. The Jews are jealous of the Gentiles, i.e., are disturbed out of envy towards them when they see their glory passing over to them: "I will provoke you by that which is not a people" (Dt 22:21). </font></font><b>883. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now if their trespass, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he answers the question as interpreted in the second way and shows that the fall of the Jews is reparable. He does this in three ways: first, from its usefulness; </font></font>441 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">secondly, from the Apostle's intention [v. 12; n. 885]; thirdly, from the condition of that people [v. 16; n. 891]. In regard to the first he presents the following reason: a good is more powerful than an evil in producing usefulness, but the evil which befell the Jews produced something very useful for the Gentiles, therefore, their good will produce greater usefulness for the world. What he is saying is this: It has been said that by their trespass the salvation of the Gentiles was achieved. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now if their trespass</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the Jews', </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">means riches for the world, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., for the Gentiles, because the trespass of the Jews resulted in spiritual riches for the Gentiles, (This refers to their guilt, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and their failure</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, by which they fell from the lofty glory they had, pertains to their punishment).

As testimony to this I say to you Gentiles, i.e., Gentiles converted to the faith: "I said, 'Behold me' to a nation that did not call upon my name" (Is 65:1). This, I repeat, I say to you: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the special care of whom has fallen to me on account of the office entrusted to me: "For this was I appointed a preacher and apostle, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth" (1 Tim 2:7); </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will magnify my ministry </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not with things that pertain to worldly honor: but first by adorning it with good morals: "As servants of God we commend ourselves in every way in much patience." (2 Cor 6:4). Secondly, by performing extra works to which he was not bound: "What then is my reward? Just this: that by making his anxiety embrace everyone's salvation: "Apart from all other things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches" (2 Cor 11:28). </font></font><b>888. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in order to make my flesh, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., the Jews, who are related to me in the flesh, as was said above in chapter 9(:3), </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">jealous: </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"Do not despise your own flesh" (Is 58:7): </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and thus save some of them, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">namely, of the Jews: "not seeking my own advantage but that of many, that they may be saved" (1 Cor 10:33). </font></font><b>889. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But this seems contrary to what he says in 2 Cor (10:13): "But we will not boast beyond limit, but will keep to the limits God apportioned us, to reach even to you" But he had not accepted the limit of his service, which was to the Gentiles. Therefore, he should not have concerned himself about the Jews. Some say that the Jews living in Judea did not pertain to his apostolate, but to that of Peter, James and John (Gal c.2). But the Jews living among the Gentiles pertained to his apostolate and he worked for their salvation. </font></font>443 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But this seems contrary to his statement here. For if those Jews were the limit of his apostolate, he would not be magnifying his service. Therefore, it must be said that preaching to the Gentiles was committed to him in such a way that he was bound to it by necessity, as he says: "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. For necessity is laid upon me" (1 Cor 9:16); but he was not forbidden to preach to the Jews, even though he was not bound to do so. Consequently, by working for their salvation he magnified his service. But he would not have done this, if he thought their fall irreparable. Hence the Apostle's very zeal for the conversion of the Jews was the sign he adduced for stating that the fall of the Jews was reparable. </font></font><b>890. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For if</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he assigns the reason for his interest, namely, that the conversion of the Jews would contribute to the salvation of the Gentiles. Hence he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For if their loss</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., their unbelief and disobedience, as a slave is said to be lost when he flees from the cave and obedience of his master. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If I say the loss of the Jews means the reconciliation of the world, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">inasmuch as we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., that the Jews will be accepted again by God, as it says in Zech (11:17): "I took unto me two rods." What, I say, will such an acceptance mean but that it will make the Gentiles rise to life? For Gentiles are the believers who will grow lukewarm: "Because wickedness is multiplied, most men's love will grown cold" (Mt 24:12), or will fall away entirely, being deceived by Antichrist. These will be restored to their primitive fervor after the conversion of the Jews. </font></font>444 <b>891. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If the dough</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he proves the same thing by considering the statue of the Jewish race. This he does in two ways. First, on the part of the apostles, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If the representative portion </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">[</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">delibatio</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is holy, so is the whole lump. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The apostles chosen by God from the Jewish people are the representative sample taken from the whole lump. If, therefore, the apostles are holy, the consequence is that the Jewish people are holy. "You are a holy nation, God's own people" (1 Pt 2:9). </font></font><b>892. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he proves the same thing on the part of the patriarchs, who are compared to the Jews as root to branches; hence it says in Is (11:1): "there shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse." If, therefore, the patriarchs, who are the root, are holy, then the Jews, who grew from them as branches, are also holy. </font></font><b>893. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But this seems to conflict with what is said in Ex (18:9): "if a man is righteous, he shall surely live." Therefore, it does not follow that if the root is holy, so also the branches. The answer is that the Apostle is not speaking here of actual holiness, for he does not mean to say that unbelieving Jews are holy; but of potential holiness. For if their ancestors and descendents are holy, nothing prevents them from being called back to holiness themselves. Or one might answer that those who imitate the patriarchs are a special type of branch, as it says in Jn (8:39): "If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did." </font></font></font><b><br />
<div align="center"><font size="3">_________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font></div><font size="3">(17) But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree, (18) do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you. (19) You will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." (20) That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith. So do not taste high things, but stand in awe. (21) For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.

(23) And even the others, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.

First, the defection of the Jews. Hence he says: We have stated that if the root is holy, so too the branches. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if some of the branches</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., some of the Jews but not all, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">were broken off</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., separated from the faith of their fathers who are compared as the root, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">do not boast: </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"The flame will dry up his shoots" (Jb 15:30); "The branches not being perfect shall be broken" (Wis 4:5). The second ground for boasting was their own promotion. But the lower the state from which one has been promoted, the more he is inclined to vain boasting, as it says in Pr (30:21): "By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear: By a slave when he reigns..." Hence he reminds them of the low state from which they were raised, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And you, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">O Gentile, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a wild olive shoot</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., a tree bearing no fruit: "He shall be like tamaric in the desert" (Jer 17:6); "Every tree that does not bear fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire" (Mt 3:10). </font></font><b>896. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he describes their promotion. First, that they have been raised to the dignity of that race; hence, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">you were grafted in their place</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead" (Job 34:24). </font></font>447 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly that they have been made associates of the patriarchs, whom he had compared to the root; hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to share the root</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., united to the patriarchs and prophets: "Many will come from the east and west, and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" (Mt 8:11). Thirdly, that they share the glory of the apostles when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and share the richness of the olive tree</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. The Jewish race is called the olive tree on account of the rich spiritual fruit they bore: "The Lord called you once a plentiful olive tree, fruitful and beautiful" (Jer 11:16); "I am like a green olive tree in the house of God" (Ps 52:8). But just as the roots of this olive tree are the patriarchs and prophets, so its richness is the abundance of the Holy Spirit's grace, which the apostles had more than all the others. This, therefore, is the way the Gentiles have been promoted to a partnership with that people, namely, with the patriarchs, apostles and prophets: "You are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets" (Eph 2:19). And although these may seem to be reasons for boasting, do not boast against the branches, i.e., against the Jews: "Your boasting is not good" (1 Cor 5:1). </font></font><b>897. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If you do boast, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he gives the reason for his admonition, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in spite of this admonition </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">you do boast </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by insulting the Jews, who stand upright or have been cut off, you should </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">remember </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as a check to your boasting that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., Judea did not receive salvation from the Gentiles, but just the reverse: "Salvation is from the Jews" (Jn 4:22).

The Gentiles converted to the faith are said to come in, as though from the exterior and visible things they venerated into spiritual things and the divine will: "Come into his presence with singing" (Ps 100:2). </font></font>454 <b>916. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that the word, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">until</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, can signify the cause of the blindness of the Jews. For God permitted them to be blinded, in order that the full number of the Gentiles come in. It can also designate the termination, i.e., that the blindness of the Jews will last up to the time when the full number of the Gentiles will come to the faith. With this agrees his next statement, namely, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and then</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., when the full number of the Gentiles has come in, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">all Israel will be saved</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, not some, as now, but universally all: "I will save them by the Lord their God" (Hos 1:7); "He will again have compassion upon us (Mic 7:19). </font></font><b>917. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As it is written</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he proves what he had said about the future salvation of the Jews: first, he proves this with an authority; secondly, with a reason [v. 28; n. 921]. </font></font><b>918. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: I say that all Israel will be saved, as it is written in Is (59:20), where our text says: "A redeemer will come from Zion and this will be my covenant with them that return to Jacob says the Lord." But the Apostle uses the Septuagint and touches on three things. First, the coming of a Savior, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">God will come</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, in human flesh to save us, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">from Zion</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., from the Jewish people who are signified by Zion, the citadel of Jerusalem, a city in Judea.

But he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will banish ungodliness from Jacob </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to show the ease with which the Jews will be converted at the end of the world: "Who is a God like thee, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance?"

Therefore, because the Old Testament was imperfect, a new testament is promised to them: "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah" (Jer 31:31) and it will have the power to remit sin through the blood of Christ: "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many </font></font>456 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the forgiveness of sins" (Mt 26:28); "He will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea" (Mic 7:19). </font></font><b>921. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As regards the gospel</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he proves his statement with a reason: first, he presents the proof; secondly, he removes an objection [v. 29; n. 924]. </font></font><b>922. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says that their sins will be taken away and that after they have sins, they are enemies of Christ. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As regards the gospel</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which they resist, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">they are enemies for your sake</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., it has turned out to your benefit.

This does not means that the merits established by the fathers were the cause of the eternal election of the descendants, but that God from all eternity chose the fathers and the sons in such a way that the children would obtain salvation on account of the fathers; not as though the merits of the fathers were sufficient for the salvation of the </font></font>457 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">sons, but through an outpouring of divine grace and mercy, the sons would be saved on account of the promises made to the fathers.

For if they are dear to God, it is reasonable that they be saved by God: "The eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou has prepared for them that wait for thee" (Is 64:4)</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font></i><b>924. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For the gifts, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he excludes an objection. For someone might claim that even though the Jews were formerly beloved on account of their forefathers, nevertheless the hostility they exert against the gospel prevents them from being saved in the future. But the Apostle asserts that this is false, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The gifts and call o God are irrevocable</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., without repentance. As if to say: That God gives something to certain ones or call certain ones is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">without repentance</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because God does not change His mind: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind" (Ps 110:4). </font></font><b>925. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">However, this seems false, for the Lord says: "It repenteth me that I made man" (Gen 6:7) and "if that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them" (Jer 18:8). The answer is that just as God is said to grow angry, not because the emotion of anger is in him but because he is related to the effect of punishments after the manner of an angry man, so he is said to repent, not because the change involved in repentance is in him but because he changes what he had done after the manner of one who repents. </font></font><b>926. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Nevertheless, it does seem that God's gifts are not without repentance, because they are frequently lost, as in Mt (25:28): "Take the talent from him and give it </font></font>458 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to him that has ten talents." Furthermore, God's call seems to be changed sometimes, since it is written: "Many are called but few are chosen" (Mt 22:14). But it should be noted that "gift" is taken here for a promise made according to God's foreknowledge or predestination, and "call" is taken for election. Because both are so certain, whatever God promises is as good as given and whomever He elects is somehow already called. Such temporal gifts and callings are not voided by a change in God, as though He repented of them, but by a change in man who casts them off: "Take heed lest anyone be wanting in the grace of God" (Heb 12:15). </font></font><b>927. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">This passage can also be taken to mean that God's gifts which are bestowed in baptism, and the calling by which the baptized person is called, exist without the repentance of the baptized person. Furthermore, it was introduced to counteract any despair about the future salvation of the Jews, since they do not seem to repent of their sin. But against this interpretation are the words of Peter: "Repent and be baptized everyone of you" (Ac 2:38). This can be answered by recalling that repentance is of two kinds: interior and exterior. Interior repentance consists in the heart's contrition by which one is sorry for past sins. Such repentance is required of the baptized, because, as Augustine says: "No one who is arbiter of his own will can begin the new life, unless he repents of the old life; otherwise, he would approach dissembling." But exterior repentance consists in making satisfaction outwardly, and this is not required of the baptized person, because by baptismal grace man is freed not only of guilt but of all penalty, in virtue of the passion of Christ who satisfied for the sins of all: "All </font></font>459 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death" (Rom 6:3); "By the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ" (*** 3:5). </font></font><b>928. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But since the keys of the Church and all the other sacraments work by the power of Christ’s passion, it seems that by the same reasoning all the other sacraments should liberate man from guilt and from all punishment. But the answer is that Christ’s passion works in baptism in the manner of a generation, which requires that a man die completely to his former life to receive a new life. And because the debt of punishment belongs to the oldness of the former life, it is taken away in baptism. But in the other sacraments Christ’s passion works in the manner of a cleansing, as in the sacrament of penance. But a cleansing does not require that right away every remnant of weakness be taken away. And the same argument applies to the other sacraments. </font></font><b>929. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But since the confession of sins is relevant for exterior repentance, one could ask whether confession of sins is required at baptism. And it seems that it is, because Mt 3(:6) says that men were baptized by John, "confessing their sins." But the answer is that John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance, namely because by receiving that baptism they declared that they would undertake penance for their sins, and so it was fitting that they should confess so that penance could be meted out to them in accord with the nature of their sins. But Christ’s baptism is a baptism for the remission of all sins, such that the baptized person no longer owes any satisfaction for his past sins, and for this reason there is no need for vocal confession. For the reason </font></font>460 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">confession is necessary on the sacrament of penance is so that the priest can, by the power of the keys, fittingly loose or bind the penitent. </font></font><b>930. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Just as you were</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he gives the reason for the future salvation of the Jews after their unbelief.

The statement applies to the genera of individuals not to all the individuals of the genera. God wishes all men to be saved by His mercy, in order that they be humbled by this fact and ascribe their salvation not to themselves but to God: "Destruction is thy own, O Israel: they help is only in me" (Hos 13:9); "In order that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be made subject to God" (Rom 3:19). </font></font></font><b><br />

But to us God has revealed them through his Spirit" (1 Cor 2:12 &amp; 10). Secondly, he shows the excellence of divine wisdom according as it has height in itself, and indeed is that height which is the supreme principle. Two points pertain to this: first, that it does not proceed from something else; secondly, that other things proceed from it [v. 36; n. 942]. </font></font><b>941. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">That God's wisdom does not depend on a higher source is shown in two ways. First, by the fact that it is not instructed by someone else's teaching.

For counsel is needed by one who does not fully know how something is to be done, and this does not apply to God: "To whom has thou given counsel? Perhaps to him that has no wisdom" (Jb 26:3). Secondly, by the fact that it is not helped by another's gift. Hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid, a</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">s one giving first? As if to say: No one. For man can give God only what he has received form God: "All this abundance comes from thy hand and is all thy own" (1 Chr 29:16); "If thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand" (Jb 35:7). </font></font><b>942. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, For from him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he shows God's depth, inasmuch as in Him are all things.

In one way the acting or movent principle; in another way the matter, in a third way the opposite contrary, which is the point of departure of the change. For we say that the knife came to be "from" the knife maker, "from" the steel, and "from" the unshaped [matter]. But the universe of creatures was not made from pre-existing matter, because even their matter is an effect of God. Accordingly, created things are not said to be from something but from its opposite, which is nothing; because they were nothing, before they were created to exist: "We are born of nothing" (Wis 2:2). But all things are from God as from their first maker: "All things are from God" (1 Cor 11:12). </font></font><b>944. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that another Latin word for "from" is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which seems to suggest the same relationships; however, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">always designates a consubstantial cause. For we say that the knife is from [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] the iron, but not from [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] the maker. Therefore, because the Son proceeds from the Father as consubstantial with Him, we say that the Son is from [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] the Father. But creatures do not proceed from God as consubstantial with Him; hence, they are not said to be from [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">de</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] Him but from [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">ex</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] Him. </font></font>466 <b>945. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The preposition, "through" designates the cause of an action; but because an action lies between the maker and the things he makes, there are two ways in which the preposition, "through," can designate the cause of an action. In one way accordingly as the action comes from its performer, as something which is its own cause of acting is said to act through itself. In one way this is the form, as we say that fire acts through heat. In another way it is a higher agent, as we say that man begets man through the power of the sun or rather of God. So, therefore, all things are said to be through him in two ways: In one way as through the first agent, by whose power all things act: "Through me kings reign" (Pr 8:15). In another way, inasmuch as His wisdom, which is His essence, is the form through which God makes all things: "The Lord through wisdom founded the earth" (Pr 3:19). </font></font><b>946. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In another way the preposition, "through," designates the cause of an action, not as it comes from the performer but as terminated in its products, as we say that the artisan makes a knife through a hammer: not that the hammer works with the artisan in the way described above, but because the knife comes to be from the activity of the artisan by means of the hammer. Therefore, it is said that this preposition, "through," designates authority directly, as when we say that the king acts through his bailiff—which pertains to what is now being said. But sometimes in a causal sense, as when we say that the bailiff acts through the king—which pertains to the preceding mode. In this mode about which we are now speaking, all things are said to have been made by the Father through the Son, as in Jb (1:3): "All things were made through him," not that the Father has from the Son the power to make thing, but rather that the Son </font></font>467 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">accepts the power of making things from the Father, a power not instrumental but principal, not of a lower order but equal, not diverse but the same: "Whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise" (Jn 5:19). Hence, although all things were made by the Father through the Son, The Son is not an instrument or minister of the Father. </font></font><b>947. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The preposition, "in," also designates a causal relationship in three ways: in one way it designates matter, as we say that the soul is in the body or a form in matter. This is not the way in which things are said to be in God, because He is not the material cause of things. In another way it designates a relationship of efficient cause, in whose power it lies to dispose of its effects. In this sense all things are said to be in Him, inasmuch as all things lie under His power and arrangement: "In his hand are all the ends of the earth" (Ps 95:4); "In him we live and move and have our being" (Ac 17:28). In a third way it designates a relationship of final cause, in that the entire good of a thing and its preservation consists in its own optimum. In this sense all things are said to be in God as in the goodness preserving them. "All things hold together in him" (Col 1:17). </font></font><b>948. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">When he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">All</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, it is not be taken absolutely for all things which have true being. Sins do not have true being, but insofar as they are sins they lack some being, due to the fact that evil is nothing else than a deprivation of good. Therefore, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">From him and through him and to him are all things</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, this does not include sin, because, according to Augustine, since is nothing and man accomplishes nothing when he sins. yet, whatever entity is present in sin, it is from God. </font></font>468 <b>949. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore, according to the foregoing, all things are from Him, i.e., God as from the first operating power. All things are through Him, inasmuch as He makes all things through His wisdom. All things are in Him as in their preserving Goodness. Now these three things, namely, power, wisdom and goodness are common to the three persons. Hence, the statement that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">from him and through him and in him </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">can be applied to each of the three persons. Nevertheless, the power, which involved the notion of principle, is appropriated to the Father, Which is the principle of the entire godhead; wisdom to the Son, Who proceeds as Word, which is nothing else than wisdom begotten; goodness is appropriated to the Holy Spirit, Who proceeds as love, whose object is goodness. Therefore, by appropriation we can say: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">from him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, from the Father, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through him, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">namely, through the Son, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, in the Holy Spirit, are all things. </font></font><b>950. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">To him be honor and glory forever, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he allows God's dignity, which consists in the two things previously mentioned. For from the fact that all things are from Him and through Him and in Him, honor and reverence and subjection are owed Him by every creature: "If I am a father, where is my honor" (Ma. 1:6). But from the fact that He has not received either counsel or gifts from anyone, glory is owed Him; just as on the contrary it is said of man: "If then you received it, why do you boast as though it were not a gift?" (1 Cor 4:7). And because this is proper to God, it says in Is (42:8): "I am the Lord; my glory I give to no other." </font></font><b>951. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Finally, he mentions His eternity when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">unto the ages of ages</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because His glory does not pass as does man's glory, of which it is said: "All its glory is </font></font>469 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">like the flower of the filed" (Is 40:6). But God's glory lasts for all ages, i.e., through all the ages succeeding all ages, inasmuch as the duration of any given thing is called an age. Or </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">unto the ages of ages </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">refers to the durations of incorruptible things, which contain the ages of corruptible things. This applies especially to God’s eternity, which can be spoken of as a plurality because of the multitude and diversity of things contained in it, even though it is one and simple in itself. The meaning would then be "unto the ages that contain the ages": "Your reign is a reign of all ages" (Ps 144:13). </font></font><b>952. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Amen</font></font></i></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, as confirmation. As if to say: Truly it is so. This is the meaning in the gospels when it says: "Amen, I say to you." Sometimes, however, it means: May it come to pass. <br /><br />Thus in Jerome's Psalter it says: "All the people will say: Amen, Amen," where our text has "May it come to pass! May it come to pass!" </font></font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

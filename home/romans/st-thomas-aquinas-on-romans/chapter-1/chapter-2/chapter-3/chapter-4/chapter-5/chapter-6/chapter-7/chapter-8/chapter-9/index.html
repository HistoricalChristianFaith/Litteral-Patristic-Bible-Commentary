He raises this question because the Jews, seemingly called to God’s special protection, had fallen from grace; whereas the Gentiles, previously alienated from God, had been admitted to it. First, therefore, he discusses the election of the Gentiles; secondly, the fall of the Jews, in chapter 10 [n. 813]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he recounts the greatness of the Jews; secondly, he shows how the Gentiles have been drawn into that greatness [v. 6; n. 748]. </font></font>361 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In regard to the first, he does two things: first the Apostle shows his affection for the Jewish people, lest anything he had said or was about to say against them should seem to proceed from hatred; second, he shows their dignity [v. 4; n. 742]. Concerning the first he does two things. First he confirms what he was about to say; second, he demonstrates his affection [v. 2; n. 737]. </font></font><b><font size="3">736. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Concerning the first he does two things. First, he confirms what he is about to say with a simple assertion: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I am speaking the truth</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, which especially befits the preacher who is a witness to the truth: "My mouth will utter truth" (Pr 8:7); "Love truth and peace" (Zech 8:19). And because a person sometimes mixes falsehood with the truth, he excludes this when he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I am not lying</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Putting away falsehood, let everyone speak the truth to this neighbor" (Eph 4:25). Secondly, he confirms what he is about to say with an oath, which is a confirmation supported by the testimony of infallible truth. Such are the witnesses of the saints: first, God Himself, as it say in Job 16:19: "My witness is in heaven." Hence Paul says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in Christ</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., through Jesus Christ Who is the truth without falsehood: "The Son of God whom we preached among you was not Yes and No" (2 Cor 1:19). Secondly, the infallible witness of the saints is their conscience; hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">my conscience bears me witness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience" (2 Cor 1:12). But because one’s conscience is sometimes erroneous unless it is corrected by the Holy Spirit he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in the Holy Spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit" (Rom 8:16). </font></font>362 <b><font size="3">737. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then (v. 2) he shows his affection for the Jews by the pain he suffered from their fall. First, he describes this pain; secondly, he mentions a sign of it [v. 3; n. 739]. </font></font><b><font size="3">738. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He emphasizes how much pain he has suffered in three ways. First by its magnitude: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I have great sorrow</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, because it concerns a great evil, namely, the exclusion of such a great people: "Vast as the sea is your ruin" (Lam 2:13). But this seems to conflict with Sir (30:22) where it says: "Give not up your soul to sadness," which seems to agree with the opinion of the Stoics, who admitted no sadness at all in the soul of a wise man. For since sadness is a reaction to a present evil, it cannot exist in a wise man to whom no evil is present. For they supposed that virtue was the only good and sin the only evil. But this opinion is refuted in two ways. First, because bodily defect, although they are not such evils as make men evil, are nevertheless among the evils which nature abhors. Hence, even the Lord is described as saddened by them: "My soul is sorrowful, even to death" (Mt 26:38). Secondly, since charity requires that a person love his neighbor as himself, it is laudable for a wise man to grieve over a son of his neighbor as over his own. Hence the Apostle says: "I fear that I May have to mourn over many of those who sinned" (2 Cor 12:2). Thus, worldly sadness, which springs from love of the world, works death and is rejected, but sadness which is godly and springs form divine love works salvation, as it says in 2 Cor 7:10. Such was Paul’s sadness. </font></font>363 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Secondly, he emphasizes his grief by its duration, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and unceasing anguish</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; not that he never ceased to grieve actually, but habitually: "That I might weep day and night for the slain of my people" (Jer 9:1). Thirdly, he emphasizes how real it was when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in my heart</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; for it was not superficial but rooted in the heart: "My eyes are spent in weeping…. My heart is poured out in grief" (Lam 2:11). </font></font><b><font size="3">739. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then (v. 3) he presents the sign of his sadness, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For I</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, who am so fervent in the love of Christ, as was shown above, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">could wish that I myself were accursed [anathema]</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. Here it should be noted that "anathema" is a Greek word formed by combining "ana" which means "above" and "thesis" which means "placing," so that something placed above is said to be anathema. For when they found among the spoils of war something they did not wish men to use, they hung it in the temple. Form this, the custom arose that things but off from the common use of men were said to be "anathema"; hence, it says in Jos 6:17: "Let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord." </font></font><b><font size="3">740. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He says, therefore: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">i.e., separated from Him. One is separated from Christ in two ways: in one way by a sin, through which one is separated form the love of Christ for not obeying His commandment: "If you love me, keep my commandments" (Jn 14:15) But the Apostle could not wish to be separated from Christ in this way for any reason, as he explained in c. 8. For this is against the order of charity, by which a person is bound to love God above all things and his own salvation more than that of others. So he does not say "I wish" but "I could wish" during his days </font></font>364 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">of unbelief. But according to this explanation the Apostle is not saying anything great, because in those days he was willing to be separated from Christ even for himself. Hence, a Gloss explains that he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I have great sorrow, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">referring to the sorrow with which he grieved over his past state of sin, during which he willed to be separated from Christ. In another way one can be separated from Christ, i.e., from the fruition of Christ possessed in glory. This is the way the Apostle wished to be separated from Christ, for the salvation of the Gentiles, not to mention the conversion of the Jews. For he says in Phil (1:23): "My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remains in the flesh is more necessary on your account." This he now says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">I could wish</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, namely, if it were possible, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">to be anathema</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., separated from glory either absolutely or temporarily from Christ’s honor, which would be enhanced by the conversion of the Jews, as it ways in Pr 14:28: "In the multitude of the people is the dignity of the king." Hence, Chrysostom says: "Love so ruled his mind that to please Christ he would not only sacrifice being with Christ, which he deemed more desirable than anything else, but also the kingdom of heaven, which would be the reward of his labor for Christ." </font></font><b><font size="3">741. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">The cause of this attitude is shown when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for the sake of my brethren</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. Hence Sir (25:1) says: "Three things are approved before God and men: the concord of brethren, the love of neighbors, and a wife and husband who live in harmony." Then to show that he was not referring to those who were his spiritual brethren in Christ, he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">who are my kinsmen by race</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Are they descendents of Abraham? So am I" (I Cor 11:22). </font></font>365 <b><font size="3">742. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then (v. 4) he shows the greatness of the Jews in order that his sadness appear reasonable on account of the ancient dignity of a deteriorating people (for it is a weightier evil to lose greatness than never to have possessed it) and not as though it arose solely from worldly love. </font></font><b><font size="3">743. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But he shows their greatness in three ways. First, from their face when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">They are Israelites</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., descending from the stock of Jacob who was called Israel (Gen 32:28). This pertains to their greatness, for it says in Dt (4:7): "Neither is there any nation so great as to have their gods coming to them…" </font></font><b><font size="3">744. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Secondly, he shows the greatness of that race from God’s blessings: first, the spiritual blessings, one of which refers to the present: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">to them belongs the sonship</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: hence it says in Ex (4:22): "Israel is my son, my firstborn." This refers to the spiritual men who arose among that people: but as to worldly men he stated above (8:15) that they received the spirit of slavery in fear. Another spiritual blessings refers to the future when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the glory, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">namely, of the sons of God promised to them. A reference to this is found in Ex (40:32): "The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle." Then he sets out other, figural benefits, of which there were figures of present spiritual benefit. The first of these is the covenant, i.e., the pact of circumcision given to Abraham, as is recorded in Gen c. 17, although this could be referred to the new covenant preached first to the Jews. Hence, the Lord Himself said: "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Mt 15:24); and Jer (31:31): "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel." The second is the Law given through Moses; hence, he continues: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the giving of the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "Moses commanded a law to us" (Sir 24:33). The third is </font></font>366 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">divine worship when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the worship </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">with which they served God, when all the other nations were serving idols: "But now hear, O Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen" (Is 44:1). Then he mentions the blessing which pertains to future glory when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and the promises</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. For the promises made in the Old Testament and fulfilled by Christ seem made especially to the Jews; hence he says below (15:8): "I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs." Now many other promises were made to them about earthly goods, as is recorded in Lev (c. 26) and Dt (c. 18), but by these temporal goods spiritual [goods] were prefigured. </font></font><b><font size="3">745. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Third he describes the Jews’ dignity by their origin, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">to them belong the Patriarchs</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, because they were begotten according to the flesh by those ancestors who were especially acceptable to God: "I love your fathers and chose their descendants after them" (Dt 4:37); "Like the first fruit on the fig tree I saw their fathers" (Hos 9:1). </font></font><b><font size="3">746. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Fourthly, he shows their greatness from the a descendant when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Who says: "Salvation is from the Jews" (Jn 4:22). </font></font><b><font size="3">747. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then to prevent this from being underestimated he shows the greatness of Christ, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Who is God over all, blessed for ever. Amen</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "This is the true God and eternal life" (I Jn 5:20). In these words four heresies are refuted: first, Manichean, which held that Christ had not a true but imaginary body. This is refuted when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">according to the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font>367 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For He has true flesh, as it says in Lk (24:39): "A spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have." Secondly, Valentinus’ heresy which claims that Christ’s body was not taken from the human line but brought from heaven. This is excluded when he says that Christ was from the Jews </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">according to the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, in keeping with Mt (1:1): "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Thirdly, the heresy of Nestorius according to whom the Son of man was other than the Son of God. Against this the Apostle says here that He is from </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the patriarchs </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">according to the flesh Who is God over all. Fourthly, the Arian heresy, which claimed that Christ was less than the Father and created form nothing. Against the first he says that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He is over all</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; against the second that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He is blessed for ever</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. For it is true of God alone that His goodness remains forever. </font></font><b><font size="3">
<div align="center">_________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>(6) But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, (7) and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but "Through Isaac shall your descendants be named." (8) This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants. (9) For this is what the promise said, "About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son." </font></b><b><font size="3">(10) And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived of one man, our forefather Isaac, (11) though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call, (12) she was told, "The elder will serve the younger." (13) As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." </font></b><br /><b><font size="3">__________________________________________________________________________________</font></b><br /><br /><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">After asserting the greatness of the Jews [n. 735], the Apostle now shows that it did not refer to those who descended according to the flesh from the ancient patriarchs but to the spiritual progeny chosen by God. First, he shows that this greatness arises from God's selection; secondly, that this selection applies generally to Jew and Gentiles [v. 24; n. 796]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows how from God's choice men obtain spiritual greatness; secondly, he raises a question about the justice of God's choice [v. 14; n. 765]. In regard to the first he does two things: First, he states his proposition; secondly shows it [v. 7b; n. 751]. Concerning the first, he does two things. First he sets out the firmness of the divine election; second, he shows in whom it is accomplished [v. 6b; n. 750]. </font></font>369 <b>749. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: It has been stated that the promises, the adoption of sons, and glory referred to people whose fall is to me a source of great sadness and unceasing sorrow. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But it is not as though the word of God had failed</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., was frustrated, because although it has found no place in those who had fallen, it has a place in others: "The word that goes forth from my mouth shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose" (Is 55:11); "For ever, O Lord, thy word is firmly fixed" (Ps 119:89). </font></font><b>750. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 6b) he shows how and in whom God's word had failed. In regard to this it should be noted that the Jews boasted mainly of two things, namely, Abraham, who first received the pact of circumcision from God (Gen c.17) and Jacob of Israel, all of whom descendants were counted as God's people. This was not true of Isaac, for the descendants of his son Esau did not belong to God's people. Hence the Apostle states his proposition: first, by a comparison with Jacob: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For not all who are descended form Israel </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., from Jacob according to the flesh, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">are true Israelites</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, to whom God's promises belong, but those who are upright and see God by faith: "Fear not, Jacob, and thus most righteous whom I have chosen" (Is 44:2). Hence the Lord also said to Nathanael: "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile" (Jn 1:47). Now this name, "Israel," had been put on Jacob by an angel (Gen c.32). Secondly, he states the same things by comparison with Abraham saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., are not the spiritual sons of Abraham to whom God promised the blessings, but only those who imitate his faith and works: "If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did" (Jn 8:40). </font></font>370 <b>751. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 7b) he clarifies his statement: first, in regard to Abraham; secondly, in regard to Jacob [v. 10; n. 755]. </font></font><b>752. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first he does three things: first, he cites a text from Scripture, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through Isaac shall your descendants be named</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This the Lord said to Abraham, as it says in Gen (c. 21), when describing the expulsion of Ishmael. As if to say: not all who were born from Abraham according to the flesh belong to that seed to whom the promises were made, but hose who are like Isaac. </font></font><b>753. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 8) he explains the quoted text so far as it applies to his thesis. To understand this it should be noted that the Apostle says in Gal (4:22): "Abraham had two sons, on e by a slave and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave," namely, Ishmael, "was born according to the flesh," because he was born according to the law and custom of the flesh from a young woman: "the son of the free woman," namely, Isaac, "through promise" and not according to the flesh, i.e., not according to the law and custom of the flesh, because he was born from a sterile, old woman, as it says in Gen (c.18); although he was born according to the flesh, i.e., according to the substance of the flesh he received from his parents. From this the Apostle decides that those adopted into the sonship of God are not </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the sons of the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., not because they are the bodily descendants of Abraham, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but the children of the promise are descendants</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., those who are made songs of Abraham because they imitate his faith, as it says in Mt (3:9): "God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham." Thus, Ishmael, born according to the flesh was not numbered among the seed, but Isaac born by the promise was. </font></font>371 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, (v.9) he proves that his explanation is valid, when he says that the children of the promise are the ones signified by Isaac, namely, because Isaac was born as the result of a promise. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For this is what the promise said</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Hence, it says in Gal (4:5): "So that we might receive adoption of sons." </font></font><b>755. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 10) he clarifies his thesis so far as it concerns Jacob.

And it should be noted that the Apostle cites this against the Jews who supposed that they would obtain righteousness through the merits of their forefathers, which is contrary to what is said about just men, namely, that "they will deliver neither sons nor daughters but they alone will be delivered" (Ez 14:18). This is why John said to the Jews: "Do not presume to say, 'We have Abraham as our father'" (Mt 3:9). Paul, therefore, </font></font>372 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">counters this opinion by reminding them that of Abraham's children one was chosen and the other rejected. But he could have ascribed this difference to the mothers, because Ishmael was born of a slave and Isaac of a free woman, or to the changed meriting state of the father; because while uncircumcised he begot Ishmael but circumcised he begot Isaac. To exclude any such subterfuge, therefore, he cites the case where one is chosen and the other rejected, even though both were born of the same father and the same mother at the same time and, indeed, from one coition. </font></font><b>757. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 11) he clarifies his thesis: first, by the authority of Gen (c. 28); secondly, by a text from the prophet Malachi (v. 13). </font></font><b>758. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first he does three things: first, he indicates the time of the promise and says that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">when they were not yet born</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, one of the sons of Rebecca was set over the other in virtue of the promise. And just as his previous statement excluded the opinion of the Jews trusting in the merits of their forefathers, so this statement counters the error of the Manicheans who claimed that a person's life and death were controlled by the constellation under which he was born, against what is said in Jer (10:2) "Be not afraid of the signs of heaven which the heathens fear."

This also corrects Origen's error who supposed that men's souls were created when the angels were, and that they merited different lives depending on the merits they earned for the good or evil they had done there. This could not be true in the light of what is stated here, namely that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">they had done nothing either good or bad. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Against this also is Job (38:7): "Where were you when the morning stars praised me together and all the sons of God made joyful melody?"

This seems to fit Gen (25:23): "The nations are in your womb; the one shall be stronger than the other." Thirdly, it can be taken figuratively so that by the elder is understood the Jewish people, who were the first to receive the adoption of sons, in accord with Ex 4:22, "Israel is my firstborn son," and by the younger is understood the Gentiles, who were called to the Father later and were signified by the prodigal son (Lk c. 15).

But because man's love is preceded by God's love: "Not that we loved God, but that he has first loved us" (1 Jn 4:20), we must say that Jacob was loved by God before he </font></font>375 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">loved God. Nor can it be said that God began to love him at a fixed point in time; otherwise His love would be changeable. Consequently, one must say that God loved Jacob from all eternity, as it says in Jer (31:3): "I have loved you with an everlasting love." </font></font><b>763. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now these words of the Apostle identify in God three things pertaining to the saints, namely, election, by which is understood God's predestination and election. In God these are really the same, but in our understanding they differ. For it is called God's love, inasmuch as he wills good to a person absolutely; it is election, inasmuch as through the good he wills for a person, he prefers him to someone else. But it is called predestination, inasmuch as he directs a person to the good he wills for him by loving and choosing him. According to these definitions predestination comes after love, just as the will's fixation on the end naturally precedes the process of directing things towards the end. Election and love, however, are ordered differently in God than in man. For in men, election precedes love, for a man's will is inclined to love a thing on account of the good perceived in it, this good also being the reason why he prefers one thing to another and why he fixed his love on the thing he preferred. But God's love is the cause of every good found in a creature; consequently, the good in virtue of which one is preferred to another through election follows upon Gods willing it—which pertains to His love, Consequently, it is not in virtue of some good which He selects in a man that God love him; rather, it is because He loved him that He prefers him to someone by election. </font></font>376 <b>764. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But just as the love, about which we are speaking, pertains to Gods eternal predestination, so the hatred about which we are speaking pertains to the rejection by which God rejects sinners. It should not be supposed that this rejection is temporal, because nothing in the divine will is temporal; rather, it is eternal. Furthermore, it is akin to love or predestination in some respect and different in another. It is akin in the sense that just as predestination is preparation for glory, so rejection is preparation for punishment: "For a burning place has long been prepared, yes, for the king it is made ready" (Is 30:33). It is different in that predestination implies preparation of the merits by which glory is reached, but rejection implies preparation of the sins by which punishment is reached. Consequently, a foreknowledge of merits cannot be the reason for predestination, because the foreknown merits fall under predestination; but the foreknowledge of sins can be a reason for rejection on the part of the punishment prepared for the rejected, inasmuch as God proposes to punish the wicked for the sins they have from themselves, not from God; the just He proposes to reward on account of the merits they do not have from themselves: "Destruction is thy own, O Israel; thy help is only in me" (Hos 13:9). </font></font></font><b><br />

For it pertains to justice that things be dispensed equally to equals. But when differences arising from merit are removed, men are equal. Therefore, if without consideration of merits God dispensed unequally by choosing one and rejecting the other, it seems that there is injustice to Him; contrary to what is said in Dt (32:4) </font></font>378 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"God is faithful and without any iniquity"; "Righteous art thou, O Lord, and right are thy judgments" (Ps 119:137). </font></font><b>767. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that Origen fell into error trying to solve this objection.

For some of those spiritual creatures were turned to God by love, some more and some less; on this basis the various orders of angels were distinguished. Others turned from God, some more and some less; on this basis they were bound to bodies, either noble or lowly; some to heavenly bodies, some to bodies of demons, some to bodies of men. Accordingly, the reason or making and distinguishing bodily creatures is the sin of spiritual creatures. But this is against what is said in Gen (1:31): "God saw everything which he had made, and it was very good," which gives us to understand that goodness was the cause of producing bodily creatures, as Augustine says in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The City of God </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(c.11). </font></font><b>768. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore, we must set aside this opinion and see how the Apostle solves the problem when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Let it not be! </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to this he does two things: first, he solves the problem with respect to choosing the saints; secondly, with respect to hating and rejecting the wicked [v. 17; n. 799].

But the Apostle quotes it according to the Septuagint version saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For the Lord says to Moses: 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The meaning is that all our blessings are ascribed to God's mercy, as it says in Is (63:7): "I will remember the tender mercies of the Lord, the praise of the Lord for all the things the Lord has bestowed upon us"; and in Lam (3:22): "The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed; because his commiserations have not failed. </font></font><b>770. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The text Paul cites is explained in two ways in a Goss, so that it solves the question and the objection in two ways. First, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will have mercy on whom I have mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., on him who is worthy of mercy. To amplify this he repeats: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will have compassion on whom I have compassion</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., on whom I judge worthy of compassion, as it says in Ps 103 (v.13): "The Lord has compassion on them that fear him." It follows from this that although he imparts his blessings from mercy, he is nevertheless excused from injustice; for he gives to those who should be given and does not give to one who should not be given, according to the correctness of His judgment. </font></font><b>771. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But having mercy on one who is worthy can be understood in two ways: in one way so that one is counted worthy of mercy on account of preexisting works in this life, though not in another life, as Origen supposed. This belongs to the Pelagian heresy which taught that God's grace is given to men according to their merits. But this cannot stand, because, as has been stated, the good merits themselves are from God and are the effects of predestination. </font></font>380 <b>772. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But there is another way in which one is considered worthy of mercy, not on account of merits preceding grace, but on account of merits subsequent to grace; for example, if God gives a person grace and He planned from eternity to give him that grace which He foresaw would be used well. According to this the Gloss is saying that He has mercy on him who should be given mercy. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will have mercy on whom I have mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., by calling and bestowing grace, I will have mercy on him to whom I know beforehand that I will show mercy, knowing that he will be converted and abide with me. But it seems that not even this is a suitable explanation. For it is clear that nothing which is an effect of predestination can be taken as a reason for a predestination, even if it be taken as existing in God's foreknowledge, because the reason for a predestination is presupposed to the predestination, whereas the effect is included in it. But every benefit God bestows on a man for his salvation is an effect of predestination. Furthermore, God's benefits extend not only to the infusion of grace, by which a man is made righteous, but also to its use, just as in natural things God not only causes their forms but all the movements and activities of those forms, inasmuch as God is the source of all movement in such a way that when He ceases to act, no movement or activity proceeds from those forms. But sanctifying grace and the accompanying virtues in the soul are related to their use as a natural form is related to its activity. Hence, it is states in Is (26:12): "O Lord, thou hast wrought for us all our works." </font></font><b>773. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Aristotle proves this in a particular way when he discusses the works of the human will. </font></font>381 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For since man is open to opposites, say to sitting or not sitting, it must be resolved by something else. But this is done by deliberation, which is followed by choosing one over the other. But again, since man has the power to deliberate or not to deliberate, it will be necessary that something move him to deliberate. But since this does not proceed </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">ad infinitum</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, there must be some external principal superior to man which moves him to deliberate—and this principle is none other than God. In this way, then, the very use of grace is from God. But this does not mean that sanctifying grace is superfluous, any more than natural forms are superfluous, even though God works in all, as it says in Wis (8:1): "Wisdom orders all things sweetly," because through their forms all things are inclined spontaneously, as it were, to that to which they are planned by God. Consequently, it is impossible that the merits which follow grace are the reason for showing mercy or for predestination; the only reason is God's will, according to which he mercifully delivers certain ones. For it is clear that distributive justice has its field in things given as due; for example, if some persons have earned wage, more should be given to those who have done more work. But it has no place in things given spontaneously and out of mercy; for example, if a person meets two beggars and gives one an alms, he is not unjust but merciful. Similarly, if a person has been offended equally by two people and he forgives one but not the other, he is merciful to the one, just to the other, but unjust to neither. For since all men are born subject to damnation on account of the sin of the first parent, those whom God delivers by His grace He delivers by His mercy alone; and so He is merciful to those whom He delivers, just to those whom He does not deliver, but unjust to none. </font></font>382 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thus, the Apostle solves the question with a text which ascribes all to divine mercy. </font></font><b>774. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Yet it should be noted that God's mercy is viewed according to three aspects: first, according to predestination by which He proposed from all eternity to deliver certain ones: "The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting" (Ps 103:17); secondly, according to His calling and justifying, by which He saves men in time: "He saved us in his mercy" (*** 3:5); thirdly, according to the bestowal of glory, when He frees from all misery: "Who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy" (Ps 103:4). Therefore, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will have mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, by calling and justifying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">on whom I have mercy </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by predestining and having compassion and finally by crowning with glory him on whom I have mercy by calling and justifying.

This conclusion can be understood in a number of ways; in one say thus: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">So </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a man's salvation </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">depends not on man's will or exertion</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., it is not owing to anyone through any willing of his own or any outward action; </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but on God's mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., it proceeds from the sole mercy of God. What follows from the authority cited is found in Dr (9:4): "Do not say in your heart, 'It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me into this land.'" </font></font><b>776. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But it can be understood in another sense: all things proceed form God's mercy; so it depends </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not on man's will </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to will </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">or exertion </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to exert oneself, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">each </font></font>383 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">depends </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">on God's mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, as it says in 1 Cor (15:10): "it was not I but the grace of God which is with me," and in Jn (15:5): "Without me you can do nothing." </font></font><b>777. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if this is all that is understood in this word, since even grace without man's free judgment does not will or strive, he could have said the converse, namely, it does not depends on God's mercy but on man's will or exertion, which is offensive to pious ears. Consequently, something more must be understood from these words, if first place is to be given to God's grace. For an action is attributed more to the principal agent than to the secondary, as when we say that the hammer does not make the box but the carpenter by using the hammer. But man's will is moved to good by God, as it says above: "All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom 8:14); therefore, an inward action of man is not to be attributed principally to man but to God: "It is God who of his good pleasure works in you both the will and the performance" (Phil 2:13). But if willing does not depend on the man willing or exertion on the man exerting himself, but on God moving man to this, it seems that man is not master of his own action, which pertains to freedom of will. But the answer is that God moves all things, but in diverse ways, inasmuch as each is moved in a manner befitting its nature. And so man is moved by God to will and to perform outwardly in a manner consistent with free will. Therefore, willing and performing depends on man as freely acting; but on God and not on man, as initial mover. </font></font>384 <b>779. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 17) he solves the above problem as it refers to rejection of the wicked. First, he quotes an authority; secondly, he draws the conclusion (v. 18). </font></font><b>780. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He says, therefore: It has been shown that there is no injustice, when God loves the just from all eternity. But neither is there injustice in rejecting the wicked from all eternity. For out of God's mouth the Scripture says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have raised you up</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, or according to another rendition: "Have preserved you" </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the very purpose of showing my power in you, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>781. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The first point to notice here is what God does in regard to the rejected. He shows this when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For this purpose have I preserved you, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e. you had deserved to die for the evils you had done: Those who do such things deserve to die" (Rom 1:32), but I did not call you to die at once; rather I preserved you in life for this purpose, namely, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">of showing my power in you. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">This interpretation can also be obtained from the version which reads: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have raised you up</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., although before me you deserved to be dead, I granted you life, as if I had raised you up. From this it appears that God works no injustice against the rejected, sine they deserved to be destroyed at once for their crimes; rather, the fact that He preserves their life proceeds from His exceeding goodness: "Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgment; and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing" (Jer 10:24). Another interpretation is this, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have raised you up </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for sin, that you might become worse. This should not be understood as though God causes sin in man; rather, it should be understood in a permissive sense, namely, that from His just judgment he permits </font></font>385 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">some to fall into sin on account of previous sins, as it says above (1:28): "God gave them up to a base mind." But it seems to me that still more must be understood here, namely, that men are moved to good and to evil y God through an inward prompting. Hence, Augustine says in his book </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">On Grace and Free Will </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that God works in men's hearts to incline their wills whithersoever He wills, either to good through His mercy or to evil according to their deserts. Thus, God is aid very often to tire p men to do good, as it says in Dan (13:45): "The Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young boy." He is also said to raise up others to do evil, as in Is (13:1): "I will stir up the Medes against them and with their arrows they shall kill the children." However, He stirs them to good and to evil in different ways: for he inclines men's wills to good directly as the author of these good deeds; but he is said to incline or stir up men to evil as an </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">occasional </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">cause, namely, inasmuch as God puts before a person, either in him or outside of him something which of itself is conducive to good but which through his own malice he uses for evil: "Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath" (Rom 2:4-5) and "God gave his place for penance: and he abused it unto pride" (Jb 24:23). Similarly, as far as in him lies, God enlightens a man inwardly to good, say a king to defend the rights of his kingdom or to punish rebels. But he abuses this good impulse according to the malice of his heart. This is plain in Is (10:6) where it is said of Assyria: "Against a godless nation I send him and against the people of my wrath I command him to take spoil and seize plunder..." and further on: "But he does not so intend, and his mind </font></font>386 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">does not so think, but it is in his mind to destroy." That is the way it happened with Pharaoh, who, when he was prompted by God to defend his kingdom, abused this suggestion and practiced cruelty. </font></font><b>782. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, there is need to consider the purpose behind God's doing certain things and permitting certain things. For one must remember that God works in creatures to manifest Himself, as it says in Rom (1:20): "His invisible nature has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made"; hence these promptings are ordained to this manifestation both for those present, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the very purpose of showing my power in you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, "and Israel saw the great work which the Lord did against the Egyptians Ex (14:3), and for those absent, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thus, it is clear that in this matter there in no injustice in God, because he uses his creature according to its merits for his glory. And it can be interpreted in the same sense if it be said </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have raised you up</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., I have ordered your malice to my glory; for God orders the malice, but does not cause it. </font></font><b>783. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 18) he draws a conclusion from the two texts cited: from the text, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will have mercy on whom I have mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he concludes: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore he has mercy upon whomever he wills: </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"The Lord has mercy on them that fear him" (Ps 103:11); from the text, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have raised you up</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he concludes, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "You have hardened our heart, so that we fear thee not: (Is 3:17); "Some of them he blessed and exalted, and some of them hath he cursed and brought low" (Sir 33:12). There seems to be no difficulty about God's mercy, once we grant what has been said above. </font></font>387 <b>784. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But two difficulties seem to exist in regard to hardening: first, hardening of heart seems allied to sin, as it says in Sir (3:27): "A hard heart shall fear evil at the last." Consequently, if God hardens the heart, He is the author of a sin—contrary to what is said in Jas (1:13): "God is no tempter to evil." The answer is that God is not said to harden anyone directly, as though He causes their malice, but indirectly, inasmuch as man makes an occasion of sin out of things God does within or outside the man; and this God Himself permits. Hence, he is not said to harden as though by inserting malice, but by not affording grace. The second difficulty is that this hardening does not seem ascribable to the divine will, since it is written: "This is the will of God, your sanctification" (I Th 4:3) and "He desires all men to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4). The answer is that both mercy and justice imply a disposition of the will. Hence, just as mercy is attributed to the divine will, so also that which is just. Therefore, the interpretation is that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he has mercy upon whomever he wills </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through His mercy and </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he hardens whomever he wills </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through His justice, because those whom He hardens deserve to be hardened by Him, as was stated above in chapter 1. </font></font></font><b><br />

First, he places the objection; secondly, the solution [v. 20; n. 788]. </font></font><b>787. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: We have said that God has mercy on whomever He wills and hardens whomever He wills. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">You will say to me then: Why does he still find fault? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., what need is there to inquire any further into the cause of the good and evil done here, since all things are attributed to the divine will, which is a sufficient cause, since no one can resist Him?

Therefore, He does not seem to have a just complaint, because it all proceeds from His will, which no one can resist. Hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Who can resist his will? </font></font></i>389 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Or still another way: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Why does he still find fault</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., why is man still required to do good and avoid evil: "He has showed you , O man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you but o do justice, and love mercy and walk with your God?" (Mic 6:8). For it is useless to require of someone that which is not in his power. But nothing seems to lie in man’s power, according to the above, in which all things seem ascribed to the divine will, which cannot be resisted. He adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For who can resist his will? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As if to say: no one. "There is none that can resist they majesty" (Est 13:11). And this seems to be the Apostle's meaning. </font></font><b>788. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 20) he answers the question. To understand his answer it should be noted that with regard to the election of the good and the rejection of the wicked two questions can arise. One is general, namely, why does God will to harden some and be merciful to some; the other is particular, namely, why does He will to be merciful to this one and harden this or that one? Although a reason other God's will can be assigned, in the first question the only reason that can be assigned in the second question is God's absolute will. An example is found among humans. For if a builder has at hand many similar and equal stones, the reason why he puts certain ones at the top an others at the bottom can be gathered from his purpose, because the perfection of the house he intends to build requires both a foundation with stones at the bottom and walls of a certain height with stones at the top. But the reason why he put these stones on the to and those others at the bottom seems to be merely that the builder so willed. First, therefore, the Apostle answers the problem involved in the second question, namely why He has mercy on this one and hardens that one; </font></font>390 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">secondly, the problem involved in the first question, namely, why He is merciful to some and hardens others [v. 22; n. 792]. In regard to the first he does three things: first, he censures the questioner's presumption; secondly, he cites an authority which solves the question [v. 21; n. 790]; thirdly, he explains the authority [v. 21b; n. 791]. </font></font><b>789. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But who are you, O man, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fragile and unknowing, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to answer back to God" </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">How would you answer Him, if He were to contend with you in judgment? "If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times" (Jb 9:3). Again, as it says in Jb (39:30): "He who argues with God let him answer him." In this we are given to understand that man should not examine the reason for God's judgments with the intention of comprehending them, for they exceed human reason: "Seek not the things that are too high for thee" (Sir 3:22); "He that is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory" (Pr 25:27). </font></font><b>790. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 20b) he cites the authority of Is (29:16): "Shall the thing made say of its maker, He did not make me?" Here it should be noted that if an artisan uses base matter to make a beautiful vessel for noble uses, it is all ascribed to the goodness of the artisan; for example, if from clay he fashions pitchers and serving-dishes suited to a banquet table. If, on the other hand, from such base matter, say clay, he produced a vessel adapted to meaner uses, for example, for cooking or such, the vessel, if it could think, would have no complaint. But </font></font>391 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">it could complain, if from precious metals, such as gold and precious stones, the artisan were to make a vessel reserved for base uses. But human nature has baseness about it from its matter, because as Gen (2:7) says: "God formed man of dust from the ground," and more baseness after being spoiled by sin, which entered this world through one man. That is why man is compared to dirt, in Jb (30:19) "I am compared to dirt and I am likened to dust and ashes." Hence, any good that man possesses is due to God's goodness as its basic source: "O Lord, thou art our Father, we are the clay, and thou art the potter, we are all the work of they hand" (Is 64:8). Furthermore, if God does not advance man to better things but leaves him in his weakness and reserves him for the lowliest use, He does him no injury such that he could justly complain about God. </font></font><b>791. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 21) the Apostle explains the words of the prophet. As if to say </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">What is molded</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the vessel., should not say to the potter: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Why have you made me thus?</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because the potter is free to make anything he wishes out of the clay. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Has the potter no right over the clay, to make </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">without any injury to it </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">out of the same lump </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">of base matter </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">one vessel for honor</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., for honorable use </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and another for dishonor, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., for meaner uses: "In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble." (2 Tim. 2:20). In the same way God has free power to make from the same spoiled matter of the human race, as from a clay, and without any injustice some men prepared for glory and some abandoned in wretchedness: "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel" (Is 18:6). </font></font>392 <b>792. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 22) he answers the first question, namely, why God wills to be merciful to some and leave others in wretchedness, i.e., to choose some and reject others. Here it should be noted that the end of all divine works ins the manifestation of divine goodness: "The Lord has made all things for himself" (Pr 16:4). Hence, it was stated above that the invisible things of God have been clearly perceived in the things that have been made (1:20). But the excellence of the divine goodness is so great that it cannot be manifested in one way or in one creature. Consequently, he created diverse creatures in which He is manifested in diverse ways. This is particularly true in rational creatures in whom is justice is manifested with regard to those he benefits according to their deserts and His mercy in those He delivers by His grace. Therefore, to manifest both of these in man He mercifully delivers some, but not all. First, therefore, he gives an account of the rejections of the wicked; secondly, of the election of the good [v. 23; n. 794]. </font></font><b>793. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In both cases three differences should be considered. First, with respect to the end; secondly, with respect to use; thirdly, with respect to the divine act. Now the end of the rejection or hardening of the wicked is the manifestation of divine justice and power. Referring to this he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">What</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., But </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">if God, desiring to show him wrath, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., retaliatory justice. For wrath is said of God not as an emotion but as the effect of retaliation: "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven" (Rom 1:18). Then he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and to make known his power</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because God not only uses wrath, i.e., retribution, by punishing those subject to him, but also by subjecting them to himself by his power: </font></font>393 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"According to his work by which he can subject all things to himself" (Phil 3:21); "And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them" (Ex 14:31). The use which God makes of the wicked is wrath, i.e., punishment. And this is why he calls them vessels of wrath, i.e., instruments of justice that God uses to show wrath, i.e., retributive justice: "We were by nature children of wrath" (Eph 2:3). But God’s action toward them is not that he disposes them to evil, since they of themselves have a disposition to evil from the corruption of the first sin. Hence he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fit for destruction</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., having in themselves an disposition towards eternal condemnation: "God saw that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times" (Gen 6:5). The only thing God does concerning them is that he lets them do what they want. Hence not without meaning does he say </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">has endured</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. And the fact that he does not exact retribution immediately shows his patience; so he adds </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">with much patience</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "The most high is a patient rewarder" (Sir 5:4). </font></font><b>794. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then on the part of the good he likewise sets out three things. First the end, when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in order to make known the riches of his glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For the end of the election and mercy shown the good is that he might manifest in them the abundance of his goodness by calling them back from evil, drawing them to justice, and finally leading them into glory. And this is the meaning of </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that he might show the riches of his glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, the riches concerning which he said above (2:4), "Or do you despise the riches of his goodness?" "God who is rich in mercy" (Eph 2:4). </font></font>394 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And it is significant that he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in order to make known the riches of his glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because the very condemnation and reprobation of the wicked, carried out in accord with God’s justice, makes known and highlights the glory of the saints, who were freed from such misery as this. Second he describes their use, when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the vessels of mercy</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. He names them vessels of mercy because God uses them as instruments to show his mercy: "These were men of mercy" (Sir 44:10). Thirdly he sets out God’s action in their regard. For God does not merely endure them, as though they were of themselves disposed to the good, but rather he prepares and disposes them by calling them to glory. Hence he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">which he has prepared beforehand for glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "Preparing the mountains by your power." </font></font><b>795. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Even to this point the Apostle uses an incomplete and suspensive construction, so that the meaning is: If God wants to do this, to have mercy on some and harden others, what can justly be said against it? As though to imply: Nothing. For he does not will to harden them in such a way that he compels them to sin, but rather he endures them so that they may tend to evil by their own inclination. </font></font></font><b><br />

In regard to the first he cites two texts from Hosea speaking fro the Gentiles: the first of these promises them God's gifts; the second, divine sonship [v. 26; n. 800]. </font></font><b>799. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the Lord </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">says in Hosea</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because it was he who spoke in the prophets: "The spirit of the Lord spoke through me, his word is upon my tongue" (2 Sam 23:2). Hence, too, it says in Hosea (1:2) "When the Lord first spoke through Hosea." Here it should be noted that the Gentiles were cut off from three blessings for which the Jews were famous: first, divine sonship, by reason of which they were called the people of God, as though serving Him and obeying His precepts: "We are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his herd" (Ps. 96:7). But the Gentiles were alienated from the society of this people, as it says in Eph (2:12): "Alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise." However, through Christ they have become God's people: "He gave himself for us to purify for himself a people of his own" </font></font>397 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(*** 2:14). And that is what he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Those who were not my people</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the Gentiles, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will call my people</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., that they be my people. The second is the privilege of divine love: "The Lord loves the people of Israel" (Hos 3:1), because He offered them many benefits leading to special graces. From this love the Gentiles had formerly been excluded: "Alienated from God's truth because of the ignorance that is in them" (Eph 3:18). Hence, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and her who was not beloved</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the Gentile races, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I will call my beloved</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "You who were once far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ" (Eph 2:13), "While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of hi Son" (Rom 5:10). The third is deliverance from original sin through circumcision: "The Lord will have compassion on Jacob" (Is 14:1). But the Gentiles had no share in this compassion: "On the day you were born your navel string was not out and no eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you" (Ex 16:5). But later through Christ they obtained compassion: "He saved us in virtue of his own mercy" (*** 3:5). He cites this text from Hosea according to the Septuagint, in the place where our text has: "I will have mercy on her who was without mercy, and I will so to not my people, ‘You are my people’" (Hos 2:23). </font></font><b>800. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 25) he cites another text from Hosea in which they are promised the dignity of being sons of God, about which the Jews boasted because, as it says in Is (1:2): "Sons have I reared and brought up" and in Dt (32:6): "Is he not your father?"

The first is that the word is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fulfilling</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., perfective: "The law made nothing perfect" (Heb 7:19); but the Lord says, "I have come not to abolish the law but to fulfill" (Mt 5:17), because He applied the truth to the figures of the Law, explained the moral precepts of the Law properly, removed occasions for transgressing them and even added counsels of perfection. Thus He said to the young man who had kept all the precepts of the Law: "One thing is lacking to you. If you would be perfect, go and sell what you possess and give to the poor" (Mt 19:21). For this reason He said to His disciples: "you must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Mt 5:48). The second efficacy is that the word is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">shortening</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This is suitably joined to the first efficacy, because the more perfect a word is the more profound it is and, as a consequence, simpler and briefer. Now the word of the Gospel shortens the words of the Law, because it included all the figurative sacrifices of the Law in one true sacrifice, in which Christ offered himself as a victim for us (Eph 5:2). Furthermore, it includes all the moral precepts of the Law in the two precepts of charity: "On these two precepts depend the law and the prophets (Mt 22:40). </font></font>400 </font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">28 </font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">This sentence might also be rendered: "...because nothing of them remain to be fulfilled, which is equitable according to the dictates of natural reason." </font></font><font size="3">Hence he says </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">shortening in equity</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, either because nothing is omitted of the multitude of figures and precepts of the law, but all are included in the brevity of the Gospel; or because nothing remains of them to be observed [but] what is equitable according to the dictates of natural reason:</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">28 </font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"All your commands are equitable" (Ps 118:72). </font></font><b>804. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, (v. 28) he gives the reason for this efficacy, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For the Lord upon the earth, </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., when He lives on earth as man: "Afterwards he was seen upon earth and conversed with men" (Bar 3:38), </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will execute his word</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Whereupon we esteemed him not" (Is 53:3); "Before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains" (Jer 13:16), i.e., upon Christ and His apostles who are called dark mountains, because their great dignity is hidden. </font></font><b>812. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he cites an authority for this, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As it is written</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, in Isaiah. Here the Apostle gathers together the words of Isaiah found in various places. For it says in Is (28:16): "behold, I will lay a stone in the foundations of Zion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation." From this he takes the first part of his quotation: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., as a foundation, by which is meant that by divine command Christ was established as the foundation of the Church: "For no other foundation can anyone lay that that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 3:11). Again it says in Is (8:14): "He shall be for a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel." He uses this in the middle of the quotation where he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">A stone that will make men stumble, a rock that will make them fall. </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Here the stumbling refers to their ignorance, because it says in 1 Cor (2:8): "if they had known this, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory"; but the falling refers to their unbelief by reason of which they persecuted Christ and his apostles: "We preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews" (1Cor 1:23); "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel" (Lk 2:34). The end of the quotation is taken from Is (28:16): "He that believes, let him not hasten." In place of this he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He who believes in him will not be put to shame</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, </font></font>404 </font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">because he will receive a reward from Him: "Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and your reward shall not be made void" (Si 2:8). <br /><br />The Apostle takes these words according to the Septuagint. Its sense pertains to what is in our text: "He that believes, let him not hasten," for he seems to hasten, who considers himself deceived, because he does not quickly get what he hoped. </font></font><br /><br /></div>

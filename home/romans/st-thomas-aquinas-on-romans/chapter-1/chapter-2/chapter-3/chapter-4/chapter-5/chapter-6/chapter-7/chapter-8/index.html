(2) For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has delivered me from the law of sin and of death. (3) For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weakened by the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, has damned sin in the flesh. (4) That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. (5) For those who are according to the flesh savor the things that are of the flesh, but those who are according to the spirit sense the things that are of the spirit. (6) For the prudence of the flesh is death: but the prudence of the spirit is life and peace. <font size="3">_________________________________________________________________________________</font></strong> <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">After showing that we are freed from sin [n. 406] and the Law [n. 518] through Christ’s grace, the Apostle now shows that through the same grace we are freed from damnation. First he shows that through the grace of Christ we are freed from the damnation of guilt; secondly, from the damnation of punishment, there [v.10; n. 628] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">And if Christ</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">.

(Job 34:29). Secondly, he shows to whom this benefit is granted and he mentions two conditions required for it. He sets out the first when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for those who are in Christ Jesus</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., incorporated in him by faith and love and the sacrament of faith: "As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ" (Gal 3:27); "As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me" (Jn 15:4). But to those who are not in Christ damnation is due. Hence John (15:6) continues: "If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered together, thrown into the fire and burned." Then he sets out the second condition, saying </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">who do not walk according to the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., do not follow the desires [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">concupiscentia</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">] of the flesh: "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not make war according to the flesh" (2 Cor 10:3). </font></font><b><font size="3">597. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">From these words some want to infer that in unbelievers who are not in Christ Jesus the first movements [of desire] are mortal sins, even though they do not </font></font>297 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">consent to them, and that this is what is meant by walking according to the flesh. For regarding those who do not walk according to the flesh, if the fact that they serve the law of sin in their flesh through the first movements of desire is not damnable for them precisely because they are in Christ Jesus, it follows from the contrary sense, that for those who are not in Christ Jesus [the first movements of desire] are damnable. They also give this argument. They say that an act is necessarily damnable which proceeds from the habit of a damnable sin. But original sin is damnable, because it deprives man of eternal life, and its habit remains in the unbeliever whose original sin has not been remitted. Therefore, any movements of desire that arise from original sin are a mortal sin in their case. </font></font><b><font size="3">598. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">First, it is necessary to show that this position is false. For the reason why the first movement [of desire] is not a mortal sin is because it does not reach reason, in which the notion of sin is completed. But this reason is present even in unbelievers; therefore, the first stirrings in unbelievers cannot be mortal sins. Furthermore, in the same type of sin a believer sins more gravely than an unbeliever: "How much more punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God and profaned the blood of the covenant?" (Heb 10:29). Therefore, if the first stirrings in unbelievers were mortal sins, all the more so in believers. </font></font><b><font size="3">599. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Secondly, it is necessary to respond to their reasons. For, first of all, they cannot derive this position from the words of the Apostle. For the Apostle does not say that the only thing not damnable for those who are in Christ Jesus is that in the flesh they serve the law of sin according to the movements of desire, but that there is no </font></font>298 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">condemnation at all for them. But for those who are not in Christ Jesus, this very fact is damnable. Furthermore, if this passage refers to first movements [of desire] experienced by those not in Christ Jesus, such stirrings are damnable according to the condemnation due to original sin, which still remains in them and from which those in Christ Jesus have been freed. But this does not mean that a new condemnation is added on account of such stirrings. Neither does their second argument conclude of necessity to what they intend. For it is not true that any act proceeding from the habit of a damnable sin is itself damnable, but only when it is a act perfected by the consent of reason. For if the habit of adultery is present in a person, the stirring of adulterous desire, which is an imperfect act, is not a mortal sin for that person, but only the perfect motion that exists by the consent of reason. Furthermore, an act proceeding from such a habit does not have a new reason for condemnation added to the reason for condemning the habit. Accordingly, the first stirrings in unbelievers, inasmuch as they proceed from original sin, do not receive the condemnation due to mortal sin but only to original sin. </font></font><b><font size="3">600. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, he proves what he had said. And first, in regard to the first condition that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus; secondly, in regard to the second condition, i.e., for those who do not walk according to the flesh, there [v. 4b; n. 612] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">who walk not according to the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. In regard to the first he does two things. First, he presents a proof; </font></font>299 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">secondly, he manifests his presupposition through its cause, there [v. 3; n. 606] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For what was impossible for the Law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">601. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In regard to the first he presents this argument. The law of the spirit frees man from sin and death; but the law of the spirit is in Christ Jesus. Therefore, by the fact that one is in Christ Jesus, he is freed from sin and death. That the law of the spirit frees from sin and death he proves thus: The law of the spirit is the cause of life; but sin and death, which is an effect of sin, are excluded by life, for sin itself is spiritual death for the soul. Therefore, the law of the spirit frees man from sin and death. But damnation is only through sin and death. Therefore, nothing of damnation exists in those who are in Christ Jesus. This, therefore, is what he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">602. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In one way this law can be the Holy Spirit, so that the </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">law of the spirit </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">means the law which is the Spirit. For a law is given in order that through it men may be led to the good; hence, the Philosopher says in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Ethics </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">II that the intention of the lawgiver is to make citizens good. Human law does this by merely indicating what ought to be done; but the Holy Spirit dwelling in the mind not only teaches what is to be done by instructing the intellect but also inclines the affection to act aright: "But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things," as to the first, "and suggest to you all things," as to the second, "all that I have said to you" (Jn 14:26). </font></font>300 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">24 </font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">This citation from 1John does not precisely match the Vulgate or modern editions. </font></font><b><font size="3">603. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In another way the law of the spirit can be the proper effect of the Holy Spirit, namely, faith working through love. This faith teaches what is to be done: "His anointing teaches you about everything" (1 Jn 2:27) and inclines the affections to act: "The love of Christ controls us" (2 Cor 5:l4). And this law of the spirit is called the new law, which is the Holy Spirit himself or something which the Holy Spirit produces in our hearts: "I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts" (Jer 31:33). But when he spoke about the old law [n. 557] he said only that it is spiritual, i.e., given by the Holy Spirit. </font></font><b><font size="3">604. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">And so, considering what has been said, we find four laws mentioned by the Apostle: first, the law of Moses, about which he says: "I delight in the law of God in my inmost self"; secondly, the law of inclination to sin [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">fomes</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">]: "I see in my members another law"; thirdly, the natural law in one sense of the term, concerning which he adds, "at war with the law of my mind"; fourthly, the new law, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the law of the spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">605. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He adds, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">of life</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, because just as the natural spirit makes the life of nature, so the divine Spirit makes the life of grace: "It is the Spirit that gives life" (Jn 4:63); "The Spirit of life was in the wheels" (Ezek 1:2).

He proves this by an argument taken from the resurrection of Christ. In regard to this he mentions three things. First, the need for the Incarnation [n. 611]; secondly, the mode of the Incarnation, there [v. 3b; n. 607] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">God, sending his own son</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; thirdly, the fruit of the Incarnation, there [v. 3c; n. 609] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and of sin</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">.

He sent him not to exist where he previously did not exist, because as it says in John 1(:10), "He was in the world," but to exist in a way in which he did not exist in the world, i.e., visibly by means of the flesh he assumed; hence in the same passage (John 1:14): "And the Word became flesh.....and we have beheld his glory"; "Afterwards he appeared upon earth" (Bar 3:37). <b>608. </b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Therefore he adds </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in the likeness of sinful flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. This should not be taken to mean that he did not have true flesh but only the likeness of flesh, as though it were imaginary, as the Manicheans say, since the Lord himself says: "A spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have" (Lk 24:40).

For in sacred scripture such a victim is called sin: "They feed on the sin of my people" (Hos 4:8). Hence it says in 2 Cor 5(:21), "Him who did not know sin for our sake God made to be sin," i.e., a victim for sin. And so by satisfying for our sin, he took away the sins of the world: "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (Jn 1:29). </font></font><b><font size="3">610. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He sets out the second effect when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">that the justification of the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., the justice which the Law promised and which some hoped to obtain from the Law, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">might be fulfilled</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., made perfect, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, who exist in Christ Jesus: "The Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained the righteousness which is through faith" (Rom 9:30); and in 2 Cor 5(:21) after saying, "Him who did not know sin for our sake he made to be sin," he adds, "so that in him we might be made the justice of God." </font></font><b><font size="3">611. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">The only way this could be done was through Christ.

And first, he proves it; </font></font>308 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">secondly, he shows that the believers to whom he writes are immune to such prudence, there [v. 9; n. 625] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But you are not in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. In regard to the first he does two things. First, he proves his statement about prudence of the flesh in the abstract; secondly, he applies what he had said about prudence of the flesh to those who follow prudence of the flesh, there [v. 8; n. 624] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And those who are in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. In regard to the first he sets out three middle [terms], each of which proves the one before it. </font></font><b>620. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Using the first middle, he proves something stated earlier [n. 617], namely, that the prudence of the flesh is death, in the following way: He that is hostile to God incurs death: "But as for those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me" (Lk 19:27); and this because God is our life: "For he is your life" (Dt 30:20). And so, he that is hostile to God incurs death; but </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Therefore, the prudence of the flesh is the cause of death. </font></font><b>621. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Here it should be noted that what he earlier called the prudence of the flesh he now calls the wisdom of the flesh, not because prudence and wisdom are absolutely the same but because wisdom in human matters is prudence: "Wisdom is prudence to a man" (Pr 10:23). To understand this it should be recognized that one who knows the highest cause on which all things depend is called wise in the strict sense. But the supreme cause absolutely of all things is God. Therefore, wisdom in the strict sense is knowledge of divine things, as Augustine says in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The Trinity</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "Yet among the mature we do impart </font></font>309 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">wisdom" (1 Cor 2:6). Now one who knows the highest cause in a particular genus is said to be wise in that genus. For example, in the art of building it is not the man who knows how to cut wood and stones but the one who conceives and plans the house who is called wise; for the entire building depends on him. Hence the Apostle says in 1 Cor 3(:10), "As a wise architect I have laid the foundation." Thus, therefore, one is called wise in human matters who has a good understanding about the goal of human life and regulates the whole of human life accordingly, which pertains to prudence. And thus the wisdom of the flesh is the same as the prudence of the flesh, about which James 3(:15) says that it is "not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish." This wisdom is said to be hostile to God, because it inclines a man against God’s law: "Running stubbornly against him with a thick-bossed shield" (Jb 15:26). </font></font><b>622. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">To prove this he uses another middle, adding: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">it is not subject to the law of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For a person cannot hate God according to what he is in himself, since God is the very essence of goodness; but a sinner hates God inasmuch as some precept of the divine law is contrary to his will, as an adulterer hates God inasmuch as he hates the precept: "You shall not commit adultery." And so all sinners, inasmuch as they are unwilling to submit to God’s law, are hostile to God: "Should you love those who hate the Lord?" (2 Chr 19:2). Hence, he has satisfactorily proved that the prudence or wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God, because it is not subject to the law of God. </font></font>310 <b>623. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He proves this [argument] through a third middle [term], saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor can it be</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For the prudence of the flesh is a form of vice, as is clear from what has been said. But although a person subject to a vice can be freed from it and submit to God, as it says above (6:18): "Having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness," the vice itself cannot submit to God, since the vice itself is a turning away from God or from God’s law; just as something black can become white, but the blackness itself can never become white: "An evil tree cannot bear good fruit" (Mt 7:18). From this it is clear that the Manicheans were not correct in using these words to support their error, for they wished by these words to show that the nature of the flesh is not from God, since it is hostile to God and cannot be subject to God. For the Apostle is not dealing here with the flesh, which is a creature of God, but of the prudence of the flesh, which is a human vice, as has been said. </font></font><b>624. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And those who are in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he applies what he had said about prudence of the flesh to men whom the prudence of the flesh rules, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Those who are in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., who follow the desires of the flesh by the prudence of the flesh, so long as they are this way </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">cannot please God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because, as it says in Ps 147(:11), "The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him." Hence those who do not submit to him cannot please him, so long as they remain such. But they can cease to be in the flesh according to the manner described and then they will be pleasing to God. </font></font><b>625. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he shows that those to whom he is speaking are immune from the prudence of the flesh. In regard to this he does three things. First, he </font></font>311 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">describes the state of believers, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But you are not in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This makes it clear that he is not speaking about the nature of the flesh. For the Romans, to whom he was speaking, were mortal men clothed in flesh. Rather, he is taking flesh for the vices of the flesh, as in 1 Cor 15(:50), "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." Hence he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">You are not in the flesh</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., you are not in the vices of the flesh as though living according to the flesh: "Living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh" (2 Cor 10:3). </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But in the spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., you follow the spirit: "I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day" (Rev 1:10). </font></font><b>626. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he appends a condition, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">if the Spirit of God dwells in you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, through love: "You are God’s temple, and God’s Spirit dwells in you" (1 Cor 3:16). He appends this condition because, even though they received the Holy Spirit in baptism, they might through a later sin have lost the Holy Spirit. Concerning this it says in Wis 1(:5) that [the Holy Spirit] "will not abide when iniquity comes in." </font></font><b>627. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, he shows that this condition should be found in them, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now if anyone does not have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For just as that is not a bodily member which is not enlivened by the body’s spirit, so he is not Christ’s member who does not have the Spirit of Christ: "By this we know that we abide in him, because he has given us of his own Spirit" (1 Jn 4:13). It should be noted that the Spirit of Christ and of God the Father is the same; but he is called the Spirit of God the Father inasmuch as he proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit of Christ inasmuch as he proceeds from the Son.

In regard to the first he presents this argument: All who are sons of God obtain the inheritance of a glorious life; but those who are ruled by the Holy Spirit are sons of God. Therefore, all who are ruled by the Holy Spirit obtain the inheritance of a glorious life. First, therefore, he posits the minor of this proof; </font></font><font size="3">316 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">secondly, the major [v. 17; n. 646]. In regard to the first he does two things; first, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it [n. 637]. </font></font><b>635. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first there two things to consider. First, how some are led by the Spirit of God. This can be understood in the following way: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">All who are led by the Spirit of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., ruled as by a leader and director, which the Spirit does in us, inasmuch as he enlightens us inwardly about what we ought to do: "Let thy good spirit lead me" (Ps 143:10). But because one who is led does not act on his own, whereas the spiritual man is not only instructed by the Holy Spirit regarding what he ought to do, but his heart is also moved by the Holy Spirit, it is necessary to get a better understanding of what is meant by </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">all who are led by the Spirit of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For those are led who are moved by a higher instinct. Hence we say that animals do not act but are led, because they are moved to perform their actions by nature and not from their own impulse. Similarly, the spiritual man is inclined to do something not as though by a movement of his own will chiefly, but by the prompting of the Holy Spirit, as it says in Is (59:19): "He will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the Lord drives," and in Lk (4:1): "Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness." However, this does not mean that spiritual men do not act through will and free choice, because the Holy Spirit causes the very movement of the will and of free choice in them, as it says in Phil (2:13): "God is at work in you both to will and to work." </font></font>317 <b>636. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, we must consider how those who are led by the Spirit of God </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">are sons of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This is clarified by a likeness to natural children, who are produced by the natural seed coming from the father. But the spiritual seed proceeding from the Father is the Holy Spirit. Therefore, through this seed some men are born as sons of God: "No one born of God commits sin, because the seed of God abides in him" (1 Jn 3:9). </font></font><b>637. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.15) he proves that men who receive the Holy Spirit are sons of God; and this in three ways. First, by distinguishing the gifts of the Holy Spirit; secondly, by our own testimony [v. 15b; n. 644]; thirdly, by the testimony of the Spirit [v. 16; n. 645]. </font></font><b>638. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first it should be noted that the Holy Spirit produces two effects in us: one is fear: "His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord" (Is 11:3); the other is love: "God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (Rom 5:5). But fear makes slaves; love does not. To realize this it is necessary to consider that fear bears on two things, namely, the evil from which someone flees through fear, and whatever seems to be the source of that evil. For a person is said to fear being killed and the king who has the power to kill. But sometime it happens that the evil from which someone recoils is contrary to a bodily or temporal good which a person sometimes loves inordinately and recoils from having it injured or destroyed by a mere man. This is human or worldly fear and is not from the Holy Spirit. Indeed, the Lord forbids such fear: "Do not fear those who kill the body" (Mt 10:28). </font></font>318 <b>639. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">There is a second type of fear which recoils from an evil contrary to created nature, namely, the evil of being punished, and shrinks from having this evil inflicted by a spiritual cause, namely, by God. Such fear is praiseworthy at least in one respect, namely, that it fears God: "Oh that they had such a mind as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments" (Dt 5:29). In this respect it is from the Holy Spirit. But insofar as such fear does not recoil from an evil opposed to ones spiritual good, namely, sin, but only punishment, it is not praiseworthy. It has this shortcoming not from the Holy Spirit but from man’s guilt; just as deformed faith is from the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as it is faith but not its deformity. Hence, even if a person does something good under the influence of such fear, he does not act well, because he does not act spontaneously but compelled by fear of punishment -- and this is characteristic of slaves. Therefore, this fear is properly called servile, because it makes a man act as a slave does. </font></font><b>640. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">There is a third type of fear which recoils from evil opposed to a spiritual good, namely, from sin or separation from God, which a person fears to incur from the just vengeance of God. Thus it bears on spiritual goods, but with an eye on punishment. This is called initial fear, because it is usually found in men at the beginning of their conversion. For it fears punishment due to past sins and it fears separation from God through sin because of grace infused with charity. This is the fear mentioned in Ps 111 (v.10): "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." </font></font><b>641. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The fourth type of fear has its eye entirely on spiritual things, because it fears nothing except separation from God. This is holy fear which endures forever," as it says in Ps 19 (v.9). But just as initial fear is caused by imperfect love, so this fear is caused by </font></font>319 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">perfect love: "Perfect love casts out fear" (1 Jn 4:18). For this reason initial fear and chaste fear are not distinguished against charity’s love which is the cause of both, but the fear of punishment is; because just as this fear produces slavery, so charity’s love produces the freedom of sons. For it makes a man act voluntarily for the honor of God -- which is characteristic of sons. </font></font><b>642. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now the Old Law was given in fear which was signified by the thunder and things of that sort which occurred when it was given, as it says in Ex 19 and in Heb (12:21): "So terrifying was the sight that Moses said, ‘I tremble with fear." So the Old Law, which induced men to obey God’s commandments by inflicting punishments, was given in a spirit of slavery; hence it says in Gal (4:24): "One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery." </font></font><b>643. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore, he says here: It was correct to say that "all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God." For in the New Law </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, of punishments; </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but you have received the Spirit of sonship</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, by which we are adopted as children of God: "That we might receive adoption as sons" (Gal 4:5). This does not mean that there is one spirit and another spirit, but that it is the same spirit, who produces servile fear in some and love in others. </font></font><b>644. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.15b) he manifests the same thing by our confession. For we confess that we have God as our Father, when we follow the -Lord’s instruction to pray: "Our Father, who art in heaven" (Mt 6:9). And since it is suitable not only for the Jews but also for Gentiles to say this, he uses two words to signify "Father," namely, "Abba," which is Hebrew, and "Pater," which can be Latin or Greek. Even the </font></font>320 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Lord himself says: Father, all things are possible to you" (Mk 14:36); "You will call me, My Father" (Jer 3:19). We say this not so such with the sound of our voice as with the intention of our heart, an intention so strong that it is called a cry, as with Moses to whom it was said: "Why do you cry to me? (Ex 14:15), namely, with the intention in your heart. But the great strength of this intention comes from the feeling of filial fear which he produces in us. Therefore, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In which</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, the Holy Spirit, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we cry: Abba, Father</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Hence it says in Is (6:3) that the seraphim, burning with the fire of the Holy Spirit, "cried one to another: Holy, holy, holy...". </font></font><b>645. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.16) he manifests the same thing through the testimony of the Holy Spirit, to show that we are not deceived in our confession; hence he says: The reason I say that "we cry, Abba, Father" in the Holy Spirit is that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the Spirit himself is bearing witness to our spirit that we are children of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. He bears this testimony not with external words that reach men’s ears, as the Father gave testimony to his own Son in Mt (3:17), but through the effect of filial love he produces in us. Therefore, he says that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he bears testimony </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not to our ears </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but to our spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>646. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.17) he posits the major. First he shows that to children is owed the inheritance, saying: If some are children, namely, through the Spirit, it follows that they are heirs, because the inheritance is owed not only to the natural child but also to the adopted: "We have been born anew to an inheritance which is imperishable" (1 Pt 1:4); "Yea, I have a goodly heritage" (Ps 16:6). </font></font><b>647. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he shows what that inheritance is. </font></font>321 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First he describes it in relation to God the Father, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">heirs of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Now one’s heir is a person who receives or gets his chief goods and not some small gifts, as we read in Gen (25:15) that Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac, but to the sons of his concubines he bestowed gifts. Now the chief good by which God is rich is himself. For he is rich of himself and not in virtue of something else, because he does not need the goods others have, as it says in Ps 15 (v.2): "You do not need my goods." Hence the children of God obtain God himself as their inheritance: "The Lord is my chosen portion" (Ps 16:5); "The Lord is my portion, says my soul" (Lam 3:24). </font></font><b>648. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But since the child does not obtain the inheritance unless the Father dies, it seems that man cannot be an heir of God, who never dies. The answer is that this applies to temporal goods which cannot be possessed by many at the same time; hence one must die, if another is to inherit. But spiritual goods can be held by many at the same time; therefore, it is not necessary that the Father die in order that the children become heirs. Yet it can be said that God dies for us inasmuch as he is in us by faith. </font></font><b>649. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he describes this inheritance on the part of Christ, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fellow heirs with Christ</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because just as he is the chief Son with whom we share sonship, so he is the chief heir, to whom we are united in the inheritance: "This is the heir" (Mt 21:38). </font></font><b>650. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.17b) he shows why this glorious life is delayed: first, he gives the reason concerned with suffering; secondly, the preeminence of glory over suffering [v. 18; n. 652]. </font></font><b>651. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first it must be recalled that Christ, the principal heir, attained to the inheritance, of glory through suffering: "Was it not necessary that the </font></font>322 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Christ should suffer these things and enter his glory?" (Lk 24:26). But we must not expect to obtain the inheritance by an easier way. Therefore, it is necessary that we attain to that inheritance through suffering: "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God" (Ac 14:22). For we do not receive an immortal and unsuffering body at once, in order that we might suffer along with Christ. Hence he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">provided we suffer with him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., along with Christ endure the tribulations of this world patiently, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in order that we may also be glorified </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">with Christ: "If we have died with him, we shall also reign with him" (2 Tim 2:11). </font></font></font><b><br />

But because someone might say that such an inheritance is burdensome, since it cannot be obtained except by enduring suffering, he shows the superiority of future glory over the sufferings of the present life: first he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it [v.19; n. 656]. </font></font><b>653. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: It has been stated that it is necessary for us to suffer in order to be glorified, and that we should not reject sufferings, if we would have glory. For </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, who have experienced both, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">consider</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "A man of much experience will speak with understanding" (Si 34:9). He endured many sufferings: "with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings" (2 Cor 11:23) and was a beholder of future glory: "Caught up into Paradise, he heard things that cannot be told" (2 Cor 12:3). This I consider, namely, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that the sufferings of this time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>654. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Herein he mentions four things to show the excellence of that glory. First, he designates its eternity when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the glory that is to be</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, after the present time; but there is nothing after the present time except eternity. Hence that glory surpasses the sufferings of this time as the eternal surpasses the temporal: "For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison" (2 Cor 4:17). Secondly, he designates its dignity when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which suggests a splendor of dignity: "Let the faithful exult in glory" (Ps 149:5). </font></font>324 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, he designates how it will be manifested when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to be revealed</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For the saints have glory now, but it is hidden in their conscience: "Our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience" (2 Cor 1:12). But later that glory will be revealed in the sight of all, both good and bad, about whom Wis (5:2) says: "They will be amazed at his unsuspected salvation." Fourthly, he designates its truth when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For the glory of this world is vain, because it is based on things outside a person, namely, in the trappings of wealth and in the opinion of men: "They boast of the abundance of their riches" (Ps 49:6). But that glory will be based on something within a man, as it says in Lk (17:21): "The kingdom of God is within you." </font></font><b>655. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thus, the sufferings of this life, if they are considered in themselves, are slight in comparison to the quantity of this glory: "For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you" (Is 54:7). But if these sufferings are considered insofar as they are voluntarily endured for God out of love, which the Holy Spirit produces in us, then man merits eternal life </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">ex condigno </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through them. For the Holy Spirit is a fountain whose waters, i.e., effects, well up to eternal life, as it says in Jn (4:14). </font></font><b>656. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.19b) he proves his proposition by the excellence of that glory: first, by the eager longing of the creature; secondly, by the eager longing of the apostles [v. 23; n. 675]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the eager longing of the creature; secondly, he manifests it [v. 20; n. 661]. </font></font>325 <b>657. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he says: It has been stated that future glory exceeds present sufferings. Yet this is obvious, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "We are God’s children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be" (1 Jn 3:2). For the dignity of divine sonship is hidden in the saints on account of the things they suffer outwardly; but that dignity will be revealed later, when they receive immortal and glorious life, and when the wicked will say: "Behold how they have been numbered among the sons of God" (Wis 5:5). And he says that the </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">eager longing eagerly longs </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to designate by such repetition the intensity of the eager longing, in accord with Ps 39:1, "Eagerly longing I have eagerly longed for the Lord." </font></font><b>658. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">creation </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">or "creature" can be interpreted in three ways here. In one way for just men, who are called God’s creature in a special way, either because they continue in the good in which they were created, or on account of their excellence, because every creature somehow serves them: "Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures" (Jas 1:18). But this creature, i.e., the just man, waits </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the revealing of the sons of God </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as a reward promised him: "Awaiting the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God" (*** 2:23). </font></font><b>659. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, the creature can be human nature itself, which is the substratum of the goods of grace. In the unrighteous this nature is not yet sanctified but is as though without form. </font></font>326 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In the men who have already been justified it is partially formed now with grace, but it is still, as it were, without form and awaits the final form which comes through glory. Thus, therefore, this creature, i.e., we ourselves, in virtue of our human nature </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">wait for the revealing of the sons of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. We also wait for this in virtue of the grace received into our nature, as we might say that matter waits for its form or colors wait for the completed picture: "All the days of my service I would wait till my release should come" (Jb 14:14). In a third way it can be understood of the visible creature, as are the elements of this world: "From the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator" (Wis 13:5) [n. 665, 668]. This sort of creature waits for something in two ways, for the eager longing of a sensible creature, according as it has its origin in God, is ordered to some end. And this happens in two ways. In one way, inasmuch as God endows this creature with a natural form and powers that incline it to some natural end. Thus we might say that a tree waits for is fruit to be produced or that fire waits for its higher natural place. In another way the visible is ordained by God to an end which transcends its natural form. For just as the human body will be clothed with the form of supernatural glory, so all visible creation in that glory of the children of God will itself obtain a new glory: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth" (Rev 21:1). In this way the visible creature waits for the revealing of the sons of God. </font></font><b>661. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.20) he explains this waiting: </font></font>327 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">first, the need to wait; secondly, its terminus [v. 21; n. 66]; thirdly, the sign of waiting [v. 22; n. 670]. </font></font><b>662. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now the need to wait is due to a defect to which the creature is subject. For a thing subject to no defect has no need to wait for something. He shows the creature’s defect when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for the creature was subjected to vanity</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>663. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If by creature is understood the just man, he is understood to be subject to vanity, i.e., to those bodily things which are changeable and inclined to fail. Hence they are called vain: "Vanity of vanities. All is vanity" (Ec 1:2). But it is subjected to them, because the needs of the present life require that he occupy himself with them, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not of his own will</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because he does not love such temporal things as those do against whom it is said in Ps 4 (v.3): "How long will you love vanity and seek after lies?"

For the defects which follow on changeableness, such as aging and ceasing to be and the like, are contrary to the particular nature of this or that thing which seeks self-preservation, although they are in keeping with the general nature of things.

This is a form of slavery from which the saints are freed, as they struggle toward the liberty of the children of God. Although they have the liberty of righteousness by which they are released from the slavery of sin, they do not yet have the liberty of glory, which is release from the slavery of misery: "Who has let the wild ass go free?" (Jb 39:5). </font></font><b>667. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If by creature is meant human nature, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">it will be set free from its bondage to decay</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., from suffering and decay, and tend toward the glorious liberty of the children of God, which is freedom not only from guilt but from death, as it says in 1 Cor (15:54): "Death is swallowed up in victory." </font></font>329 <b>668. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if it is taken for the visible creature, then that creature will be set free from its bondage to decay, i.e., changeableness: because in every change there is an element of decay, as Augustine says and the Philosopher too in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Physics </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">VIII this will contribute to the glorious liberty of the children of God, because just as they will be renewed, so will their dwelling place be renewed: "I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things will not be remembered," i.e., the former changeableness of the creature (Is 65:l7). </font></font><b>669. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the creation itself will be set free from its bondage</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

First, because he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">groans in travail</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, for this seems to fit only the rational creature. But this can be explained so that "groan" is the same as the previous expression, "not of its own will." For we groan against things repugnant to our will. Therefore, inasmuch as the defects of the visible creature are contrary to the natural desire of a particular nature, the visible creature is said to groan. When he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in travail</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, it is the same as the previous expression, "awaits." For travail is part of the process of producing offspring. </font></font>330 <b>672. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The second difficulty lies in the fact that he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">every creature</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because that would include the heavenly bodies; hence a Gloss says that the sun and moon do not complete their assigned span without labor. But this must be explained in such a way that labor is taken for motion, just as rest is sometimes taken for cessation from work, as God is said to have rested on the seventh day. Accordingly, by groaning is understood decay, which is an element of local motion, inasmuch as a body ceases to be in one place and begins to be in another. By travail is understood the destiny of heavenly bodies to be renewed. </font></font><b>673. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if it is understood of men, then human nature is said to be </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">every creature</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because it shares something with every creature: with the spiritual creature it shares intellect, with the animal it shares bodily life, with the corporeal creature it shares bodily existence. Therefore, this creature, i.e., man, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">groans</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, partly because of the evils it suffers and partly because of the good things it hopes for but are delayed: "Many are my groans" (Lam 1:22). It is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in travail</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because it endures with affliction of soul the postponement of the glory it awaits: "Hope deferred makes the heart sick" (Pr 13:12); "A woman in travail has sorrow" (Jn 16:21); "Anguish as of a woman in travail" (Ps 48:6). </font></font><b>674. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">until now</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because this groaning was not removed when we were made righteous, but it remains </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">until now</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., until death.

Or until now, because not only the ancient fathers who lived before Christ, but we also who did not live until the time of grace, suffer the same things. In 2 Pt (3:4) scoffers are described as saying: "Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation." </font></font>331 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that "God’s creature" can mean everything under God. Hence some try to explain the above words about every creature in such a way as to include angels. But it is quite awkward to suppose that they are subjected to futility or that they groan or are in travail, because they already have the glory, the likeness of which we await, for it says in Mt (22:30): "They will be as the angels in heaven." Therefore, ours is a more suitable explanation. </font></font></font><b><br />

For that cannot be a trifle which is desired so anxiously by great men. In regard to this he does two things: </font></font><font size="3">332 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">first, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it [v. 24; n. 681]. </font></font><b>676. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first he does three things [n. 679, 680].

From this it is clear that the apostles are greater than all other saints no matter what their credentials, whether virginity or learning or martyrdom, because they have the Holy Spirit more fully. </font></font><b>677. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But someone might say that some other saints have endured more torture and greater austerities for Christ than the apostles. But it should be recognized that the amount of one’s merit depends principally and in respect to essential reward on charity. For the essential reward consists in the joy one has in God. But it is plain that one who loves God more will enjoy Him more. Hence, the Lord promises that blessed vision to those who love: "He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I will love him and manifest myself to him" (Jn 14:21). But according to the quantity of his works man merits an accidental reward which is joy taken in those works. Therefore, the apostles performed the works they did with greater charity, which made their hearts prepared for much greater ones, if it had been opportune. </font></font>333 <b>678. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if it is said: Someone can try so hard that he will have charity equal to that of the apostles the answer is that a man’s charity is not derived from himself but from God’s grace, which is given to each "according to the measure of Christ’s gift" (Eph 4:7). Now he gives to each the grace proportionate to his calling. Thus, the most excellent grace was given to Christ, because he was called to have his human nature taken into the unity of his divine person; after him the greatest fullness of grace was conferred on blessed Mary, who was called to be the mother of Christ. Among the rest, however, the apostles were called to a greater dignity than all others, for they received from Christ himself the things that pertain to salvation and the commission to deliver them to others. Hence, the Church is in a sense founded on them, as it says in Rev (21:14): "The wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb." Therefore, God gave them a greater abundance of grace than the rest. </font></font><b>679. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he mentions the anxiety with which they wait, when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we groan inwardly</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This groaning indicates the distress caused by the postponement of something desired with great longing, as it says in Pr (13:12); "Hope deferred makes the heart sick"; "I am weary with my moaning" (Ps 6:6). This groaning, however, is more internal than external, because it proceeds from the hidden fee1ings of the heart and because it is concerned with internal goods. Hence he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we groan inwardly</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "My groans are many" (Lam 1:22). </font></font><b>680. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, he mentions what is awaited, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as we wait for adoption as sons</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., for the completion of this adoption.

But it will be brought to fulfillment, when the body is glorified: "We rejoice in the hope of sharing the glory of the children of God" (Rom 5:2). And that is why he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the redemption of our bodies</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, so that as our spirit has been redeemed from sin, so our body might be redeemed from corruption and death: "I shall ransom them from death"(Hos 13:14); "He will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body" (Phil 3:21). </font></font><b>681. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For in this hope</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he proves what he had said with the following reason: Hope is concerned with things not seen in the present but awaited in the future. But we have been saved through hope; therefore, we wait for the completion of salvation as something future. </font></font><b>682. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he presents the minor, saying: For we, the apostles and the rest of the believers, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">were saved in hope</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, because we hope for our salvation: "We have been born anew to a living hope" (1 Pt 1:3); "Hope in him at all times, O people" (Ps 62:8). </font></font><b>683. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he presents the major, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Now hope</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the thing hoped for, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">which is seen</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, as though possessed at present, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is not hope</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., not something hoped for, but something possessed.

But when something is already possessed, there is no need for one to be moved toward it. </font></font>335 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And it should be noted that because hope somehow springs from faith, he attributes to hope something that belongs to faith, namely, that it is concerned with something not seen: "Faith is the conviction of things not seen" (Heb 11:1). </font></font><b>685. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Fourthly, he presents the conclusion, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it in patience</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Hence it should be noted that patience, properly speaking, inclines one to tolerate tribulation with a certain evenness of mind: "Be patient in tribulation" (Rom 12:12). But because the postponement of something good has an aspect of evil, even the continued wait for absent goods with evenness of mind is attributed to patience, although they pertain more to long-suffering; "Be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord" (Jas 5:7). But patience is taken in both ways here, because the apostles awaited glory with evenness of mind, along with the delay and tribulation. </font></font><b>686. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then [v. 26; n. 628] he shows how we are helped by the Holy Spirit in the defects of the present life: first, for the fulfillment of desires; secondly, for the direction of external events [v. 28; n. 695].

(Jb 3:23). </font></font><b>690. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And it should be noted that the Apostle says there are two things we do not know, namely, what we should ask for in prayer and the manner in which we ought to ask [n. 691]. But both seem to be false. For in the first place we know what we should ask for, because the Lord taught us in Mt (6:9): "Hallowed be thy name." The answer is that we can know in a general way what it is suitable to pray for, but we cannot know this in particular. First of all, if we desire to perform a virtuous deed, which is to fulfill God’s will on earth as it is in heaven, it can happen that the virtuous deed does not befit this or that person. For example, the quiet of contemplation is not expedient for a person who can press onward usefully in action, as Gregory says in </font></font>337 <i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Morals on Job </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">5:26: "You shall come to your grave in ripe old age." Hence it says in Pr (14:12): "There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death." Secondly, a person desires a temporal good to sustain life, which is to seek one’s daily bread, but it puts him in danger of death. For many have perished because of riches: "Riches were kept by their owner to his hurt" (Ec 5:13). Thirdly, a person desires to be freed from a bothersome trial which, nevertheless, is for him a guardian of humility. For example, St. Paul sought the removal of a thorn of the flesh, but it had been given him to keep him from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, as it says in 2 Cor (12:7). </font></font><b>691. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Likewise, it also seems that we know how to pray as we ought, since it says in Jas (1:6): "Let him ask in faith, with no doubting." Here, too, the answer is that we can know in general, but we cannot discern exactly the special motive; for example, whether we are asking from anger or from a zeal for justice. Hence in Mt (20:20) the petition of the sons of Zebedee was refused because, although they seemed to be asking to share in divine glory, their petition proceeded from vain glory or from elation. </font></font><b>692. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.26c) he tells the way the Holy Spirit helps when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too keep for words</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This statement seems to support the error of Arius and Macedonius, who held that the Holy Spirit is a creature and lower than the Father and Son. For intercession is the role of a lesser person. But if from the fact that he is said to intercede we understand that he is a creature subject to suffering and inferior to the Father, then from the fact that he intercedes with sighs, we should </font></font>338 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">suppose that he is a creature subject to suffering and not yet enjoying beatitude -- which no heretic has ever said. For a sigh proceeds from pain which pertains to wretchedness. Consequently we must explain </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">intercedes [asks]</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., makes us ask; as in Gen (22:12): "Now I know that you fear God," i.e., I have made you know. </font></font><b>693. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For the Holy Spirit makes us ask, inasmuch as he causes right desires in us, because to ask is to make desires known. Now right desires arise from the ardor of love, which he produces in us: "God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (Rom 5:5). But with the Holy Spirit directing and inciting our heart, our desires can not but be profitable to us: "I am the Lord who teaches you to profit" (Is 48:17); therefore, he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. But when we desire something strongly and pray for it longingly, we suffer its delay with pain and sighing; therefore, he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">with sighs</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which he causes in our heart, inasmuch as he inspires us to desire heavenly things which are postponed for the soul. These are the sighs or moanings of the dove, which the Holy Spirit causes in us: "Moaning like doves" (Nah 2:7). They are </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">indescribable</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: either because they concern an indescribable thing, namely, heavenly glory: "He heard things that cannot be told" (2 Cor 12:4); or because those movements of the heart cannot be sufficiently described, inasmuch as they proceed from the Holy Spirit: "Who can explain the wisdom of the heavens?" (Jb 38:37). </font></font><b>694. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 27) he shows the efficacy of the help with which the Holy Spirit aids us, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He who searches the hearts</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., God, who alone searches the heart: "Thou who tried the minds and hearts" (Ps 7:9). </font></font>339 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But God is said to search hearts, not as though He investigates the secrets of the heart, but because he knows clearly the hidden things of the heart: "I will search Jerusalem with lamps" (Zeph 1:12).

First, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it [v. 29; n. 701]; thirdly, he draws a conclusion [v. 35; n. 721]. </font></font><b>696. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first there are two things to consider [cf. n. 699]. First, the greatness of the benefit conferred on us by the Holy Spirit, namely, that all things work together for good. To realize this we should consider that whatever happens in the world, even if it be evil, accrues to the good of the universe; because, as Augustine says in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Enchiridion</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "God is so good that he would permit no evil, unless he were powerful enough to draw some good out of any evil." However, the evil does not always accrue to the good of that in which it is. Thus, the death of one animal accrues to the good of the universe, inasmuch as by the destruction of one thing something else begins to be, although it does not accrue to the good of that which ceases to be; because the good of the universe is willed by God according to itself and to this good all the parts of the universe are ordained. </font></font><b>697. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The same seems to apply to the relationship of the noblest parts to the other parts, because the evil affecting the other parts is ordained to the good of the noblest parts. But whatever happens to the noblest parts is ordained only to their good, because his care for them is for their sake, whereas his care for the others is for the sake of the noblest: as a physician allows a malady in the foot that he might cure the head. </font></font>341 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But the most excellent parts of the universe are God’s saints to each of whom applies the word of Mt (25:23): "He will set him over all his goods." Therefore, whatever happens to them or to other things, it all accrues to the benefit of the former. This verifies the statement in Pr (11:20): "The fool will be servant to the wise," namely, because even the evil of sinners accrues to the good of the just. Hence, God is said to exercise a special care over the just, as it says in Ps 34 (v.15): "The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous," inasmuch as he takes care of them in such a way as to permit no evil to affect them without converting it to their good. This is obvious in regard to the penal evils which they suffer, hence it says in the Gloss [of Lombard, col. 1488 D] that "because in their weakness humility is exercised, in affliction patience, in contradictions wisdom and in hatred good will." Hence it says in 1 Pt (3:14): "If you suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed." It might be asked whether their sins also work together for their good. Some say that sins are not included when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">all things</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because according to Augustine: "Sin is nothing and men become nothing, when they sin." But contrary to this a Gloss says: "God makes all things work together for their good to the extent that if they deviate and stray from the path, he even makes this contribute to their good." Hence it says in Ps 37 (v.24): "Though the righteous man fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the Lord is the stay of his hand." But according to this it seems that they always arise with greater love, because man’s good consists in love in such a way that without it the Apostle says that he is nothing (1 Cor 13:2). </font></font>342 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The answer is that man’s good consists not only in the amount of love but especially in his perseverance until death, as it says in Mt (24:13): "He who endures to the end will be saved." Furthermore, because he has fallen, he rises more cautious and more humble; hence, the Gloss adds that this makes them progress, because they return to themselves more humble and wiser; for they fear extolling themselves or trusting in their powers to persevere. </font></font><b>699. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, we consider the recipients of this benefit and see something on God’s part and on man’s part. He indicates what is involved on man’s part when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for those who love God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For the love of God is in us through the indwelling Spirit. But it is the Holy Spirit who directs us in the right path; hence it says in 1 Pt (3:13): "Who is there to harm you, if you are zealous for what is right?" and in Ps 119 (v. 165): "Great peace have they who love your law; nothing can make them stumble." And this is reasonably so, because, as it says in Pr (8:17): "I love those who love me." To love is to will good to the beloved; but for God to will is to accomplish, for "whatever the Lord wills he does" (Ps. 135:6). Therefore, God turns all things to the good of those who love him. </font></font><b>700. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he considers what is involved on God’s part who, first of all, predestined believers from all eternity; secondly, calls them in time; thirdly, sanctifies them. He touches on these three things when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Who are called according to his purpose</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the predestined, the called and the sanctified; "purpose" here refers to predestination which, according to Augustine, is the resolve to be merciful: "according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will" </font></font>343 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(Eph 1:11). "Called" refers to calling: "He called him to follow him" (Is 41:2). "Saints" refers to sanctification: "I am the Lord who sanctifies you" (Lev 21:8). The Apostle says that he knows this, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we know</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "He gave him knowledge of holy things" (Wis 10:10). This knowledge arises from experience and from considering the efficacy of love: "Love is as strong as death" (S of S 8:6) and of eternal predestination: "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose" (Is 46:10). </font></font><b>701. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.29) he proves what he had said with the following proof: No one can harm those whom God advances; but God advances the predestined who love him. Therefore, nothing can harm them, but everything works for their good. First, therefore, he proves the minor, namely, that God advances them; secondly, the major [v. 31; n. 710]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions things that refer to advancement of the saints from all eternity; secondly, those that occur in time [v. 30; n. 707]. </font></font><b>702. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, he presents two things, namely, foreknow1ede and predestination when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Those whom he foreknew he also predestined</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Now some say that predestination is taken here for the preparation which occurs in time, during which God prepares the saints for grace. They say this in order to distinguish foreknowledge from predestination. But closer examination shows that both are eternal and that they differ in notion. For, as was stated above, predestination implies the mental preordaining of things which a person intends to do. But from all eternity God has predestined the benefits which he intends to give his saints. Hence, predestination is eternal. But foreknowledge differs </font></font>344 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">conceptually from predestination; because foreknowledge implies only the knowledge of future things, whereas predestination implies causality in regard to them. Consequently, God has foreknowledge even of sins, but predestination bears on salutary goods. Hence The Apostle says in Eph (1:5): "Predestined according to the purpose of his will, to the praise and glorious grace which he freely bestowed." </font></font><b>703. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Regarding the order between foreknowledge and predestination some say that foreknowledge of good and of evil merits is the reason for predestination and reprobation, in the sense that God predestines certain ones, because he foresees that they will act well and believe in Christ. According to this the present text reads: "Those whom he foreknew to be conformed to the image of his Son, he also predestined." This interpretation would be reasonable, if predestination were restricted to eternal life which is bestowed for merits. But under predestination falls every salutary benefit prepared for man from all eternity by God; hence all the benefits he confers on us in time he prepared for us from all eternity. Hence, to claim that some merit on our part is presupposed, the foreknowledge of which is the reason for predestination, is nothing less than to claim that grace is given because of our merits, and that the source of our good works is from us and their consummation from God. Hence, it is more suitable to interpret the present text as stating that those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. Then this conformity is not the reason for predestination, but its terminus or effect. For the Apostle says: "He destined us to be his adopted sons through Jesus Christ" (Eph 1:5). </font></font><b>704. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For the adoption as sons is nothing more than that conformity, because a person adopted into the sonship of God is conformed to his true Son. </font></font>345 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, in the right to the inheritance, as was stated above (v. 17): If sons, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ." Secondly, in sharing his splendor. For he is begotten of the Father as the splendor of his glory (Heb 1:3). Hence by enlightening the saints with the light of wisdom and grace, he makes them be conformed to himself. </font></font><b>705. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The phrase, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to the image of his Son</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, can be interpreted in two ways: in one way so that it means: conformed to the image of his Son, who is an image: "He is the image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15). In another way so that the sense is this: He predestined us to be conformed to his Son in the fact that we bear his image: "Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven" (1 Cor 15:49). He says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">those whom he foreknew he also predestined </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not because he predestines all the foreknown, but because he could not predestine them, unless he foreknew them: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you" (Jer 1:5). </font></font><b>706. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he indicates what follows from this predestination, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For just as God willed to communicate His natural goodness to others by imparting to them a likeness of his goodness, so that he is not only good but the author of good things, so the Son of God willed to communicate to others conformity to his sonship, so that he would not only be the Son but the first-born among sons. Thus, he who is the only-begotten through an eternal origin, as it says in Jn (1:18): "The only Son who is in the bosom of the Father," is the first-born among many brethren by the bestowal of grace: "He is the first-born of the dead, and ruler of kings on earth" (Rev 1:5). </font></font>346 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore, Christ has us as brothers, both because he communicated to us a likeness of his sonship and because he assumed the likeness of our nature, as it says in Heb (2:17): "He had to be made like his brethren in every respect." </font></font><b>707. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 30) he mentions what happens on the part of the saint as a consequence of predestination. First, he mentions the call, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Those whom he predestined he also called</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. For predestination cannot be voided: "The Lord of hosts has sworn, ‘As I have planned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand" (Is 14:24). Predestination begins to be carried out with the person’s being called. This call is twofold: one is external and is made by the mouth of a preacher: "She has sent out her maids to call from the highest places" (Pr 9:3). In this way God called Peter and Andrew, as it says in Mt (4:18). The other call is internal and is nothing less than an impulse of the mind whereby a man’s heart is moved by God to assent to the things of faith or of virtue: "Who stirred up one from the east and called him to follow?" (Is 41:2). This call is necessary, because our heart would not turn itself to God, unless God himself drew us to him: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (Jn 6:44); "Turn us to thyself, O Lord, that we may be turned" (Lam 5:21). Furthermore, this call is efficacious in the predestined, because they assent to the call: "Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me" (Jn 6:45). </font></font><b>708. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Hence secondly, he mentions justification when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">those whom he called he also justified </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by infusing grace: "They are justified by his grace as a gift" (Rom 3:24). </font></font>347 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Although this justification is frustrated in certain persons, because they do not persevere to the end, in the predestined it is never frustrated. </font></font><b>709. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, he mentions glorification, when he adds: and those he also glorified and this in two ways, namely, by growth in virtue and grace and by exaltation to glory: "In all things, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people" (Wis 19:22). He uses the past for the future, either because the future is certain, or because what is future in some is already fulfilled in others. </font></font><b>710. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 31) he clarifies the major premise, namely, that nothing can harm those advanced by God: first, he shows that they cannot suffer any loss through the evil of punishment; secondly, nor through the evil of guilt [v. 33; n. 715]. </font></font><b>711. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The evil of punishment is twofold: one consists in the imposition of evils, the other in the removal of good things. First he shows that those who are advanced by God do not suffer harm from the efforts of persecutors, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">What then shall we say? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">As if to say: since God bestows so many good things on his elect, what can be said against this, so as to nullify it? As if to say: Nothing. "No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel, can avail against the Lord" (Pr 21:30). Or: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">What shall we say? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For one is struck with amazement, when he considers these things: "I considered thy works and became terrified" (Hab 3:2). Or: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">What shall we say to this? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., what return could we make to God for such great blessings: "What shall I render to the Lord for all his bounty to me" (Ps 116:12). Then he continues, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If God is for us </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by predestining, calling, justifying and glorifying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who is against us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., successfully? "Let us stand up together, who is my </font></font>348 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">adversary?" (Is 50:8); "Place me next to you, and let anyone’s hand fight against me" (Jb 17:3). </font></font><b>712. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he shows that God’s holy ones cannot suffer loss by the removal of good things, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He who did not spare his own Son</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. But whereas he spoke earlier about adopted sons, he separates this Son from all others, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">his own Son</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., not adopted, as heretics pretend, but natural and co-eternal: "That we may be in his true son, Jesus Christ" (1 Jn 5:20) of whom the Father says in Mt (3:17): "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." </font></font><b>713. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">did not spare</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, to indicate that he did not exempt him from punishment. For there was no guilt in him to forgive: "He who spares the rod hates his son" (Pr l3:24). However, God the Father did not spare his Son, as though to add something to him who is in all things perfect God; rather he subjected him to the passion for our benefit. And this is what he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but gave him up for us all</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., in expiation for our sins: "He was put to death for our trespasses" (Rom 3:25); "The Lord put on him the iniquity of us all" (Is 53:6). God the Father gave him up to death by appointing him to become incarnate and suffer and by inspiring his human will with such love that he would willingly undergo the passion. Hence he is said to have given himself over: "He gave himself up for us" (Eph 5:2). Judas, too, and the Jews gave him up, as was explained at the end of ch. 4. </font></font><b>714. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It should be noted that in saying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He did not spare his own Son</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, it is as though he were saying: He not only exposed other holy men to tribulation for their </font></font>349 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">salvation: "I have hewn them by the prophets" (Hos 6:5); "If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation" (2 Cor 1:6), but even his own Son. But in the Son of God all things exist as in their primordial and preoperative cause: "He is before all things and in him all things hold together" (Col 1:17). Therefore, when he was given up for us, all things were given to us; hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">how has not had also, with him, given us all things</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, the highest things, namely, the divine persons to enjoy, rational spirits to live with, all lower things to use, not only prosperity but adversity as well: "All are yours and you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s" (l Cor 3:23). Hence, it is clear that, as it says in Ps 34 (v.9): "Those who fear him have no want." </font></font></font><b><br />

First, he presents his proposition; secondly, he excludes an opposite view [v. 34; n. 718]. In regard to the first it should be noted that a person suffers injury for guilt from two sources: first, from an accusation; secondly, from the judge who condemns [n. 717]. First, therefore, he shows that no accusation can harm God’s holy ones, and this by reason of divine election. For whoever chooses a person seems by that very fact to approve him. But the saints are chosen by God: "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy" (Eph 1:4). On the other hand, whoever accuses, disapproves of the one accused. Therefore he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Who shall bring any charge</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., successfully, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">against the elect</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., against those God has chosen to be saints; hence it says in Rev (12:10): "For the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down." </font></font><b>717. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he shows that no accusation can be harmful to the saints. He shows this by referring to another of God’s benefits, namely, that God justifies us. This benefit is mentioned when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It is God who justifies us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, in keeping with what he had said above (v.30): "Those whom he called he also justified"; "You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 6:11) But condemnation finds a place against the unjust: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Who</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, then, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is to condemn </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">those justified by God: "When he is quiet, who can condemn" (Jb 34:29). </font></font>351 <b>718. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 34b) he excludes an opposite view. For someone could fear that a person might be accused by Jesus Christ as a violator of Christ’s commandment in the same way as the Lord says of Moses: "It is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope" (Jn 5:45); and also that he might be condemned by him, for "He is the one ordained by God to judge the living and the dead" (Ac 10:42). Furthermore, he is immune to sin: "Who did no sin" (1 Pt 2:22); consequently, he seems qualified to accuse and condemn, as it says in Jn (8:7): "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." And so he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Christ Jesus</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. As if to say: Will Christ Jesus make accusations against God’s elect or even condemn them? And he says, not so; because even according to his human nature he confers great benefits on the saints, just as he also does according to his divinity. </font></font><b>719. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he mentions four benefits from his humanity. First, from his death, when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he died</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, for our salvation: "For Christ also died for sins once for all" (1 Pt 3:18). Secondly, from his resurrection, through which he vivifies us both with spiritual life now and with bodily life later. Hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">yes, who rose from the dead</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. He says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">yes</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because it is preferable to commemorate him now for the power of his resurrection and for the weakness of his passion: "He was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God" (2 Cor 13:4). Thirdly, from his sitting with the Father when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who is at the right hand of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., equal to God the Father according to the divine nature and recipient of his choicest blessings according to his human nature. And this is also for our glory because, </font></font>352 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as it says in Eph (2:6): "He made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." For inasmuch as we are his members, in him we sit with God the Father: "He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne" (Rev 3:21). Fourthly, from his intercession when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who indeed intercedes for us </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as our advocate: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ" (1 Jn 2:1). But an advocate’s duty is not to accuse or condemn, but to repel an accuser and prevent condemnation. </font></font><b>720. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Christ is said to intercede for us in two ways. In one way by praying for us, as it says in Jn (17:20): "I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word." But now his intercession for us is his will that we be saved: "Father, I desire that they also may be with me where I am" (Jn 17:24). In another way he intercedes by presenting to his Father’s gaze the human nature assumed for us and the mysteries celebrated in it: "He entered into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God on our behalf" (Heb 9:24). </font></font><b>721. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he draws the conclusion [n. 695]. But because this conclusion does not seem credible to the inexperienced, he presents it in the form of a question. Hence he does three things: first, he presents the question; secondly, he shows the need for this question [v. 36; n. 724]; thirdly, he presents the solution [n. 725]. </font></font><b>722. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">This question can be derived in two ways from the foregoing. </font></font>353 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">One way is this: So many and such powerful benefits have been conferred on us by God that no one can count them. Furthermore, they all tend toward one thing, namely, "that we be rooted and grounded in love" (Eph 3:17). </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Who, then, shall separate us from the love of Christ? </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">i.e., the love by which we love Christ and neighbor as he commanded: "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another" (Jn 13:34). Another way is this: God bestows great benefits on his holy ones, and when we consider them, such love of Christ burns in our hearts that nothing can quench it: "Many waters cannot quench love" (S of S 8:7). </font></font><b>723. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">He mentions the evils which might induce one to abandon love of Christ. And first, those that refer to life; secondly, the one which refers to death. In regard to those which threaten us in the course of our lives, he mentions present evils and evils to come. In regard to present evils he mentions evils to be endured; secondly, the loss of good things. Evils to be endured can be considered in two ways. In one way as they are present in the sufferer who is afflicted by them in two ways: first, externally in the body. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">tribulation</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This word is related to "tribulus," a prickly herb: "Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you" (Gen 3:18). But the just are not overcome by them: "Many are the tribulations of the just, and the Lord frees them from all of these" (Ps 34:19). A person is also afflicted by them internally in the form of mental anxiety, when he does not know where to go or which way to turn. In regard to this he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">or distress</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "I am hemmed in on every side, and I do not know what to choose" (Dan 13:21). </font></font>354 </font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">26 </font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">Augustine, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">Ennarationes in Ps. 34</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">, sermon 2, n. 13. </font></font><font size="3">Again such evils can be considered as they are present in the one inflicting them. In this respect he says: </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">or persecution</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, For although persecution in the strict sense would imply pursuit of someone to make him flee: "If they persecute you in one city, flee to another" (Mt 10:23), yet in a general sense it can mean the infliction of any injury. Then he mentions the evils which consist in the removal of good things necessary for life, namely, food and clothing: "If we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content" (1 Tim 6:8). In regard to the removal of food he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">or famine</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; of clothing: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">or nakedness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad" (1 Cor 4:11).

And he quotes the words of the Psalmist as though spoken by the martyrs. These words mention, first of all, the cause of the suffering: "For it is not the suffering but the cause that makes the martyr," as Augustine says.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">26 </font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">for thy sake</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "He who loses his life for my sake shall find it" (Mt 10:39); "Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed" (1 Pt 4:15). One suffers for Christ by suffering not only for the faith of Christ but for any righteous deed done for the love of Christ: "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake" (Mt 5:10). </font></font>355 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he mentions the severity of the suffering when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we are being killed</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., handed over to death: "For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed" (Est 7:4).

Fourthly, the persecutor’s readiness to kill when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., marked to be killed in the meat market. So, too, the saints are intentionally killed: "The hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God" (Jn 16:2); "Feed the flock doomed to slaughter" (Zech 11:4). </font></font><b>725. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v. 37) he answers the question. First he gives the answer saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">No, in all these things</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, the evils mentioned above, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">we overcome</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, as long as we preserve our love unsullied: "In his arduous contest she gave him the victory" (Wis 10:12). But we do not succeed by our own strength but through Christ’s help; hence he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through him who loved us</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., on account of his help or on account of the affection we have for him; "not as though we first loved him, but because he first loved us" (1 Jn 4:19); "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 15:57). </font></font><b>726. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he clarifies the solution, showing that the saints’ love is insuperable. First he shows that it cannot be separated by creatures that exist; secondly, nor by creatures that do not exist but could [v. 39b; n. 733]. </font></font>356 <b>727. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first he does two things. First he mentions things that exist in man, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I am sure that neither death</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which is the first among things we fear, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor life</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which is first among things we desire, can separate us from the love of God: "If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord" (Rom 14:8). In these two are included all the ones previously mentioned. For six evils previously mentioned refer to life; but one, namely, the sword, refers to death. </font></font><b>728. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he mentions things outside of man. Among these are, first, spiritual creatures; hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor angels</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the lower ones assigned to guard individual men: "He will give his angels charge of thee" (Ps 91:11). </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Nor principalities</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., those assigned to guard nations: "Now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I am through with him, the prince of Greece will come. And there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael" (Dan 10:20). He adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor powers</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which is the highest order of ministering angels: "The powers of heaven will be shaken" (Lk 21:26). This can be understood in two ways: in one way of wicked angels, who struggle against the saints: "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers" (Eph 4:12). In another way it can refer to the good. Here Chrysostom in his book </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">On Compunction of Heart </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">says that the Apostle said this, not that the angels would at some time try to separate him from Christ; rather, these impossible things would be more possible, so to speak, than for him to be separated from the love of Christ. He speaks this way to show how great in him is the strength of divine love, and to lay everything out in the open. For this is the way of lovers, that they cannot hide their love </font></font>357 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in silence but assert and bare it to their friends and to the beloved, and they cannot confine the flames within their heart. They speak of them frequently, so that by constantly recounting their love they may gain some relief, some cooling of the tremendous burning within them. In just this way blessed [Paul] here acts as an outstanding lover of Christ: he gathers up in one sentence all things that are and that were, everything that can be and even those that cannot. It is similar to what is said in Galatians chapter 1(:8), "But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach to you another gospel than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed." </font></font><b>729. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he mentions visible creatures, and he sets out two distinctions. First according to time, by which they are distinguished according to present and future. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor things present</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, whether they cause pain or pleasure: "We look not to the things that are seen" (2 Cor 4:18). Then he adds: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor things to come</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. Whether we fear them or desire them, they cannot separate us from the love of Christ. Hence it says in Ac (21:13): "For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." </font></font><b>730. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he distinguishes visible creatures on the basis of magnitude: first he touches on magnitude of strength when he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor power</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., no strong creature, such as a raging fire or sea, can separate me from the love of Christ, because "love is as strong as death" (S of S 8:6). </font></font><b>731. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he mentions magnitude of dimension, describing them by what properly belongs to bodies, namely height and depth. Hence he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor height</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, from which someone might threaten to cast me headlong, as in Lk (4:29): "They led Jesus to the brow of the hill, that they might throw </font></font>358 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">him down headlong"; </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor depth</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, in which someone might submerge me: "I sink in deep mire" (Ps 69:2). These three things can also be referred to the ways a person could turn a man away from God: in one way by the force of power: but as it says in 1 Sam (2:2): "No one is strong as our God." Secondly, by the lofty height of one’s authority; but "God is the highest of the kings of the earth" (Ps. 89:27). Thirdly, by the depth of one’s wisdom; but God’s knowledge is deeper: "Deeper than Sheol -- what can you know?" (Jb 11:8). </font></font><b>732. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">These two, height and depth, can be referred to adversity and prosperity, according to 2 Cor (6:7): "With the weapons of righteousness for the right and for the left." </font></font><b>733. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">With regard to creatures which do not exist but could, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor anything else in all creation</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. According to Chrysostom, he says this about the things that are not, as though all things that are do not suffice, but he must so to speak challenge to battle even the things that are not. None of them, he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will be able to separate us from the love of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "Love never falls away" (1 Cor 13:8). This love of God is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in Christ Jesus our Lord</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because it was given to us through him, inasmuch as he gave it to us through the Holy Spirit: "I have come to cast fire on the earth and what will I but that it be kindled" (Lk 12:49). </font></font><b>734. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But since it says in Ec (9:1): "A man does not know whether he is worthy of love or hatred, but all things are kept uncertain," why does the Apostle say that he is certain that nothing can separate him from the love of God? One can answer that the Apostle is not speaking of himself personally but is spokesman for all the predestined, about whom he declares that nothing can separate </font></font>359 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">them from the love of God because of the certainty of predestination. This certainty can be caused by the power of charity which, considering its nature, cannot be separated from certain persons, since it loves God above all things. Hence if a person falls away from love, it is not on account of a shortcoming in this virtue but on account of a defect in one’s free choice. But if Paul is speaking for himself, he could be certain of it only by a revelation, because it was said to him: "My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Cor 12:9). For as to the outcome of free choice he says elsewhere: "Lest while speaking to others, I myself become a castaway" (1 Cor 9:27). </font></font>360 </font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

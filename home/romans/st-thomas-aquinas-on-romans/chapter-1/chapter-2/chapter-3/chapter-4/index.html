(3) For what do the Scriptures say? "Abraham believed God [<i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">credidit Deo</font></font></i><font size="3">], and it was reputed to him as justice."

(6) As David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God reputes justice without works: (7) "Blessed they whose iniquities are remitted, and whose sins are covered. (8) "Blessed the man to whom the Lord has not reckoned sin." (9) So does this blessedness reside only in circumcision, or also in uncircumcision? For we say that faith was reputed to Abraham as justice. (10) How therefore was it reputed? In circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. </font><font size="3">__________________________________________________________________________________</font></strong> <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">After excluding the glory which the Jews took in the Law, on the basis of which they preferred themselves to the Gentiles [n. 169 and 248], the Apostle now excludes their glory in regard to circumcision.

The answer is that this takes place in human justice, through which man is ordained to the human good. For the habit of this justice can be acquired through human works, but the justice which obtains glory before God is ordained to the divine good, namely future glory, which exceeds human ability, as is stated in 1 Cor 2(:9), "It has not arisen in the heart of man what God has prepared for those who love him." </font></font>168 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Consequently, a man’s works are not proportioned to causing the habit of this justice; rather, a man’s heart needs first to be justified inwardly by God, so that he can perform works proportioned to divine glory. </font></font><b><font size="3">326. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For what do the Scriptures say</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, he disproves the consequent, which was negative, by proving the opposite affirmative, namely, that Abraham did have glory before God.

But it should be noted that Abraham expressed the justice described, which God regards, not in some outward work but in the inward faith of the heart, which God alone sees. Indeed, since the act of faith is said to be threefold, namely, to believe God [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Deum</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">], to believe God [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Deo</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">] and to believe unto God [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">in Deum</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">], he mentions this act, namely to believe God [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Deo</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">], which is the proper act of faith and indicates its nature [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">species</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">]. For to believe unto God shows the ordering of faith to its end, which is through charity; for to believe unto God is to go to God by believing, which charity does.

Consequently, this act does not yet attain the nature of faith, because if one believes in God in virtue of certain human reasons and natural signs, he is not yet said to have the faith of which we now speak, but only when he believes something for the reason that it was said by God—which is indicated by the phrase, "to believe God [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Deo</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">]."

This is the literal explanation and accords with the intention of the Apostle, who lays special stress on the words, "it was reckoned to him as righteousness (Gen 15:6)" a saying which is used when that which is lacking on someone’s part is reckoned to him gratis, as if he had accomplished the whole.

The second thing is the fact that the disordered deed has been done and cannot be said not to have occurred, once it has been perpetrated; but it is covered over by the hand of God’s mercy and is held as if not committed. The third is the debt of punishment, in regard to which he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., to punish. </font></font><b><font size="3">339. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">So does this blessedness </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">(v. 9) he excludes a false interpretation of the text. For a Jew could interpret it as meaning that the grace of forgiveness of sins is conferred only on the circumcised.

Thirdly, from this text he concludes to the answer, although he states it in the form of a question: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">How then was it reckoned to him</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, namely, Abraham’s faith as justice, i.e., </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">was it before</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., when still uncircumcised, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">or after he had been circumcised</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">?

This is obvious from the reported sequence of events. For Gen (15:6) reports that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness, but the fact of receiving circumcision is not recorded until Gen (17:23 ff). Therefore, if Abraham, still uncircumcised, was justified by faith, it is plain that the justice of faith, through which sins are forgiven gratis, occurs not only in circumcision but also in uncircumcision, i.e., in Gentiles. </font></font><b><font size="3">

For someone could say: If Abraham was justified before circumcision, then he was circumcised without reason and for no purpose. To exclude this objection, he first states that circumcision was not the cause but the sign of righteousness; secondly, he shows what he obtains from this sign, there [v. 11b; n. 344] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that he might be the father</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">; thirdly, how he obtains it, there [v. 12b; n. 345] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who are not merely</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>342. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first he does two things.

In one way, a seal [or signet] is a visible sign possessing a likeness to the thing signified, as in Ez (28:12): "You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom." Circumcision had this visible likeness to Abraham’s faith. First, in regard to what he believed. For Abraham believed that his seed would be multiplied; hence, it was fitting to receive its sign in the organ of reproduction. Secondly, in regard to the effect of his faith, namely, the removal of fault, and this is signified by the removal of superfluous skin. In another way, "seal" [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">signaculum</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">] means a sign hiding something which is to be revealed to friends, as is clear in the case of a </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">sigillo</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">:</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="1">21 </font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"Worthy art thou, who wast slain, to take the scroll and to open its seals" (Rev 6:9).

For Abraham, still uncircumcised, was justified by faith and later received circumcision. From this he obtains the honor of being the father not only of the circumcised but also of uncircumcised believers. And this is what he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The purpose was to make him father</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., from the foregoing it comes about that Abraham </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is the father</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">of all who believe without being circumcised</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., who are in the state of uncircumcision. Or Abraham is the father through uncircumcision, i.e., in virtue of what he had in uncircumcision, namely, that it be reckoned to them also as righteousness, namely, the fact that they believe, just as it was reckoned to Abraham. The power of this fatherhood is indicated in Mt (3:9): "God is able from these stones to raise up children to </font></font>177 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Abraham." </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And likewise the father of the circumcised</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, who derive their origin from him: "Abraham is our father" (Jn 8:39). </font></font><b>345. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then he shows the manner in which he is the father even of the uncircumcised, namely, by imitation. And this is what he says: That he might be the father </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not merely of the circumcised but also of those who follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., which Abraham had, while he was still uncircumcised: "If you were Abraham’s children, you would do what Abraham did" (Jn 8:39). </font></font><b>346. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Since we are speaking of circumcision, it is fitting to consider three things about it, namely, why it was instituted [n. 347], what power it had [n. 349] and why it was changed [n. 350]. </font></font><b>347. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the first it should be noted that circumcision, just as the other ceremonies of the Law, was instituted for two purposes. First, for divine worship, for which men were disposed in accordance with these ceremonies. In keeping with this, circumcision had three reasons for being instituted, the first of which was to signify the faith and obedience by which Abraham submitted to God, so that those who accepted the circumcision of Abraham should observe his faith and obedience. For it is stated in Heb 11: "By faith Abraham was circumcised." Hence, circumcision was instituted to signify his faith in future descendants, as has been stated. The second reason was to express in a bodily sign something that was to occur spiritually, namely, just as superfluous skin was removed from the organ of reproduction, which is the chief servant of concupiscence, so every superfluous desire should be </font></font>178 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">removed from man’s heart, as Jer (4:4) says: "Circumcise yourself to the Lord, remove the foreskin of your hearts." The third reason was to distinguish the people worshiping God from all other people. This is why God commanded circumcision for the children of Israel, who were to dwell among the other nations after first living alone and uncircumcised in the desert. </font></font><b>348. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The other purpose of circumcision and all the ceremonies is based on a relation to Christ, to whom they are compared as the figure to the reality and as the members to the body: "These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the body belongs to Christ" (Co1 2:17). Accordingly, by bodily circumcision is signified the spiritual circumcision to be accomplished by Christ: first in the soul, inasmuch as it is through him that concupiscence and the effects [</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">reatus</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">] of sin are removed by Christ: "In him," namely, Christ, "also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ" (Col 2:11). Secondly, in regard to the body, namely, when in the resurrection all possibility of suffering and death is removed from the bodies of the elect. Hence, circumcision took place on the eighth day, because it signified the eighth era. For the seventh is the era of those who are at rest in Christ, while the other six are the eras during which the world runs its course. Again, circumcision was done with knives of stone (Jos 5:2) to signify that spiritual circumcision was to be effected by the Rock, who is Christ, as stated in 1 Cor (10:4). However, it was not the general practice to use a knife made of stone. </font></font><b>349. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the second question, namely, what power circumcision had, it should be noted that, as the Gloss [of Lombard, col. 1372] says here—the quotation is </font></font>179 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">taken from Bede—"During the Law, circumcision offered the same curative help against the wound of original sin as baptism is wont to give in the era of revealed grace." This shows that the power of circumcision extended to the removal of original sin. However, some say that grace was not conferred in circumcision; for without righteousness God’s grace cannot be present. But the Apostle says in Gal (2:21): "If justification were through the law, then Christ died to no purpose." And we can argue in the same way: If justifying grace were through circumcision, Christ died to no purpose. But this cannot be, for sin is never forgiven without grace: "Justified by his grace we have peace with God (Rom 5:1). Therefore, others say that grace was conferred in circumcision to produce privative effects, namely, to remove guilt, but not positive effects, namely, the work of righteousness. But this does not seem fitting either, for the positive effects of any form precede in the order of nature the privative effects; for example, light does not expel darkness except by illuminating. Similarly, grace expels guilt by producing righteousness. But if the prior is removed, the subsequent is removed. Therefore, it is better to say that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">ex opere operato </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">circumcision did not have effective power either to remove guilt or to produce righteousness. It was merely a sign of righteousness, as the Apostle says here. But through faith in Christ, of which circumcision was a sign, it removed original sin and conferred the help of grace to act righteously. </font></font><b>350. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the third question, it is clear from what has been said, why circumcision had to be changed. For it was a sign of something to come. But the same </font></font>180 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">sign does not suit the present, past and future. Therefore, baptism, as the sign of present grace, produces a more copious and more beneficial effect of grace, because the closer the agent is in time and place, the more effectively it works. </font></font><b>351. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then [n. 323] when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For not through the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he explains his statement that circumcision or any work of the Law did not justify in virtue of a divine promise. In regard to this he does two things: first, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it, there [v. 14; n. 354] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If it is the adherents of the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>352. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, therefore, the Apostle accepts on the authority of Genesis the promise made to Abraham and his seed </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that they should inherit the world</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., that all the nations of the world would be blessed in him: "By you all the families of the earth shall be blessed" (Gen 12:3).

But this seed is principally understood as Christ: "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his seed. It does not say, ‘and to seeds,’ referring to many, but referring to one" (Ga1 3:16), because in the one in whom it is to be fulfilled Ps 2 (v.8) it is shown that he would inherit the world: "Ask of me and I will make the nations your heritage." Secondarily, it is fulfilled in those who through Christ’s grace are spiritually the seed of Abraham: "The children of the promise are reckoned as descendants" (Rom </font></font>181 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">9:8).

He denies that such a promise came through the law. This is not said on account of the promise itself, because at the time of the promise the Law had not been given, but in reference to the fulfillment of the promise, so that the sense is that such a promise was not made to Abraham as something to be fulfilled through the Law, because, as it says in Heb (7:19): "The law made nothing perfect." What he asserts is that such a promise was to be fulfilled </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">through the righteousness of faith</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because "the saints through faith conquered kingdoms" (Heb 11:33). </font></font><b>354. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">If it is </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v.14) he proves his statement: first, in regard to the denial that the promise is to be fulfilled through, the Law; secondly, in regard to the assertion that it is to be fulfilled through the righteousness of faith, there [v. 16; n. 359] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Therefore it is of faith</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Now the Law is said to bring wrath, i.e., vengeance, because through the Law men were made deserving of God’s vengeance: "Great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book," i.e., of the Law (2 Kg 22:13). </font></font>183 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But someone might suppose that the Law brings wrath as far as legal ceremonies observed in the era of grace are concerned, in line with Ga1 (5:2): "If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you." However, what is stated here refers even to moral precepts, not because they command something which makes its observers deserving of God’s wrath, but because the Law commands and does not confer the grace to fulfill, according to 2 Cor (3:6): "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life," namely, because "the Spirit helps us inwardly in our weakness" (Rom 8:26). </font></font><b>358. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For where there is no law </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v.15b) he shows how it brings wrath, saying: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But where there is no law, there is no transgression</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because even though a person, with no law given, could sin by commission against what is naturally just, he is not called a transgressor, unless he violates a law: "I looked at the transgressors with disgust, because they did not keep thy commands" (Ps 119:158). Yet every sinner can be called a transgressor, inasmuch as he transgresses the natural law: "I have accounted all the sinners of the earth transgressors" (Ps 119:119). However, it is more grievous to transgress at once the law of nature and the written law than the law of nature alone. Hence, the Law having been given without the help of grace, transgression increased and deserved greater wrath. </font></font></font><b><br />

For it seems necessary that the promise be fulfilled either by faith or by the Law; but not by the Law, because the promise would be abolished. Hence, he concludes, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that is why it depends on faith</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, if we are to attain the promise of being heirs of the world: "This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith" (1 Jn 5:4). Then he confirms this with a middle term contrary to the one he used above. For it was stated that if justice were from the Law, the promise would be abolished; but if it be from faith, the promise remains solid in virtue of the power of divine grace justifying man through faith.

For there is a bodily descendant, as is referred to in Jn (8:33): "We are the descendants of Abraham," and there is a spiritual descendant, as is referred to in Mt (3:9): </font></font>186 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"God is able from these stones," i.e., from the Gentiles, "to raise up children to Abraham." Only the bodily descendants of Abraham kept the Law, but the spiritual descendants also imitate his faith. Thus, if the promise were solely through the Law, it would be fulfilled not in all the descendants but only in the bodily ones. But because it is fulfilled through faith, which is common to all, it is plain that it is fulfilled in all his descendants. </font></font><b>363. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he is the father</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he proves something he had presupposed, namely, that the descendants of Abraham are not only the children of the Law but also the children of faith. He proves this with a text from Scripture.

But it does not change the sense. "Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations" (Si 44:19). Thirdly, at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in the presence of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he explains what he had said. For "</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have made you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">" seems to imply that something destined to be fulfilled in the distant future had already come to pass. However, things that are future in themselves are present in God’s providence: "Before the universe was created, it was known to him; so it was also after it was finished" (Si 23:20). Accordingly, the Apostle says that the statement, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have made you</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, should be understood </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in the presence of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., in his presence </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in whom he believed</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Concerning this call it is stated below (9:11): "Not because of works but because of his call she was told, ‘The elder will serve the younger.’" Or he is calling God’s simple knowledge a call, or the knowledge by which he knows the future as present. This is the way it is taken in Ps 147 (v.4): "He calls the stars by their names." According to this sense, what is said here is mentioned on account of an earlier statement (v.17): </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in the presence of God in whom he believed</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font>188 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Two things seem to militate against what was said: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">I have made you the father of many nations</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. One of these was that Abraham was as good as dead from old age. Against this he says, who gives life to the dead. The other is that those many nations did not exist yet.

Yet a difference between the two can be noted, if the just, who were of Abraham’s seed, be compared to the stars: "Those who turn many to righteousness are like the stars forever and ever" (Dan 12:3) and sinners be compared to the grains of sand, because they are overcome by the waves of the world as of a sea: "I placed the sand as the bound for the sea" (Jer 5:22). </font></font><b>370. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he did not weaken</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he shows Abraham’s firmness.

For "Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born to him" (Gen 21:15) and it was the year before that a son had been promised him: "The Lord said, ‘I will surely return to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife shall have a son’" (Gen l8:l0). </font></font><b>372. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But it seems that his body was dead as far as the reproductive power was concerned, because even after Sarah died he took another wife, Keturah, who bore him a number of sons, as is recorded in Gen (25:1). Some answer that the reproductive power in him was dead as far as reproducing from an old woman was concerned, but not as far as reproducing from a young woman. For old men are wont to beget offspring from the young but not from old women, who are less fit for conception. However, it seems better to say that Abraham’s reproductive power was miraculously restored both in regard to Sarah and to all women. </font></font><b>373. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he mentions difficulty on the part of the wife when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">nor the dead womb of Sarah</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., he does not consider it so as to question the promise.

Concerning this promise of God </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">no distrust made him waver</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., doubt the truth of the divine promise: "He who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind" (Jas 1:6); </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but he grew strong in his faith</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., clung firmly to his belief: "Resist him, firm in your faith" (1 Pt 5:9). </font></font><b>376. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v .20c) he gives the reason why Abraham’s faith was firm, for he grew strong in his faith </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as he gave glory to God </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by considering his omnipotence: "Great is his power" (Ps 147:5). Hence he continues: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "Thou hast power to act whenever thou dost choose" (Wis 12:18). </font></font>192 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">From this it is clear that whoever is not firm in faith detracts from God’s glory either in regard to his veracity or his power. </font></font><b>377. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then (v.22b) he commends Abraham’s faith in regard to its effect. First, he mentions the effect it had in him, saying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that is why</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, because Abraham believed this so firmly, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">it was reckoned to him as righteousness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "And it was reckoned to him as righteousness" (1 Macc 2:52). </font></font><b>378. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he shows the effect which his faith had on others. In regard to this he does three things. First, he shows the likeness between the effect it had in him and in others, saying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But the words, ‘It was reckoned to him,’ were written not for his sake alone</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, so as to make us think that for Abraham alone faith was reckoned as justice, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but for ours also</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, name1y, faith, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will be reckoned to us </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">as justice: "Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction" (Rom 15:4). Therefore, it was written for him that he might be an example to us, and for us that he might raise our hope for righteousness. </font></font><b>379. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, there at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">believing in him </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v.24b), he shows a likeness in faith. For what was reckoned as justice was Abraham’s faith believing that his body, as good as dead, and the barren womb of Sarah could be vivified for procreating children. It will be reckoned also to us </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">and in God the Father, to whom he says in Ps 41 (v.10): "But do thou, 0 lord, be gracious to me and raise me up." And because the power of the Father and of the Son is the same, he also rose by his own power. </font></font>193 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">That this faith justifies is shown below (10:9): "If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." </font></font><b>380. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, (v. 24c) he assigns the cause why faith in the resurrection of Christ justifies, saying, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, namely, Christ, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">was put to death [was delivered over] </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by God the Father: "He did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all" (Rom 8:32), by himself: "He gave himself up for us" (Eph 5:25), by Judas: "He who delivered me to you has the greater sin" (Jn 19:11) and by the Jews: "They will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked" (Mt 20:19). </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">And raised for our justification</font></font></i></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., to justify us by rising: "So that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life" (Rom 6:4). That he was put to death for our sins seems plain from the fact that by his death he merited the remission of our sins, but he did not merit by rising, because in the risen state he was not a pilgrim but one who had arrived. <br /><br />Therefore, it must be said that Christ’s death was salutary for us not only by way of merit but also by way of effecting it. For since Christ’s human nature was somehow the organ of his divinity, as Damascene says, all the acts and sufferings of his human nature were salutary for us, considering that they flowed from the power of his divinity. But because an effect has to some extent a similarity to its cause, the Apostle says that Christ’s death, by which mortal life was extinguished in him, is the cause of extinguishing our sins. But his resurrection, by which he returns to a new life of glory, he calls the cause of our justification, by which we return to the new life of righteousness. </font></font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<div><strong>(1) Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge another; for in passing judgment upon him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things. (2)We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things. (3) Do you suppose, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God? (4) Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's leads you to penance? (5) But by your hardness and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God. <font size="3">169. </font></strong><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">After showing that the Gentiles did not become just from the knowledge of the truth they had, the Apostle now shows that neither were the Jews made just by the things in which they gloried. Consequently, both of them need the power of the gospel’s grace for salvation. First, therefore, he says that the Jews were not made just by the Law; secondly, that they were not made just by the race in which they gloried, in chapter 3 [n. 246] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then what advantage has the Jew?</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; </font></font>90 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">thirdly, that they were not made just by circumcision, in chapter 4 [n. 322] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">What therefore shall we say? </font></font></i><b><font size="3">170. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In regard to the first point it should be noted that Jews and Gentiles converted to the faith judged each other on their previous life. For the Jews objected to the Gentiles that when they lived without God’s law, they sacrificed to idols. The Gentiles on their part objected to the Jews that even though they received God’s law, they did not keep it. First, therefore, he rebukes both sides and their extravagant judgment; secondly, he shows that the Jews were not worthy of a reward, because the things they glory in were not sufficient for salvation, there [v. 13; n. 210] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For it is not the hearers of the Law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">.

In regard to the first he does two things: first, he proposes that although they judge one another, neither has an excuse; secondly, he gives the reason, there [v. lb; n. 172] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for in passing judgment</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">171. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">First, therefore, he concludes from what he stated in the first chapter that even though the Gentiles by their wickedness suppressed the truth they knew about God, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">you have no excuse, 0 man, whoever you are, when you judge another</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, just as he said earlier: "So they are without excuse" (Rom 1:20). </font></font>91 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">He says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">whoever you are</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, as if to say: Whether Jew or Gentile, because even the Gentiles, who might seem to have an excuse, cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance, as he stated above in 1:20 ff; "Do not pronounce judgment before the time" (1 Cor 4:5</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">). </font></font></i><b><font size="3">172. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For in passing judgment </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">he gives the reason by rejecting the causes for excuse: first, ignorance; secondly, innocence, there [v. 1c; n. 176] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">because you, the judge</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">173. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Ignorance is excluded by the very act of judging. For whoever judges another an evildoer shows that he knows that the conduct is evil and, therefore, that he is himself worthy of condemnation. And this is what he says: You have no excuse, for in passing judgment upon him as an evildoer you condemn yourself, i.e., you show that you are worthy of being condemned: "Judge not, that you may not be judged" (Mt 7:1). </font></font><b><font size="3">174. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">This does not mean that every judgment is a cause of condemnation. For there are three kinds of judgment: one is just, i.e., made according to the rule of justice: "Love justice, you rulers of the earth" (Wis 1:1); another is not just, i.e., made contrary to the rule of justice: "Although servants of his kingdom, you did not rule rightly" (Wis 6:4); the third is rash judgment against which Ec (5:2) says: "Be not rash with your mouth." A rash judgment is made in two ways: in one way, when a person passes judgment on a matter committed to him without due knowledge of the truth, contrary to what is stated in Jb (29:16): "I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know." In another way, when a person presumes to judge about hidden matters, of which God alone has the power to judge, contrary to what is stated in 1 Cor (4:5): "Do not pronounce </font></font>92 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness." </font></font><b><font size="3">175. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But some things are hidden not only in relation to us but of their very nature and so belong solely to God’s knowledge: first, the thoughts of the heart: "Man’s heart is deceitful and unsearchable. Who can understand it? I, the Lord, search the mind and try the heart" </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">(</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Jer 17:9); secondly, the contingent future: "Tell us what is to come hereafter that we may know you are gods" (Is 41:23). Hence, as Augustine says: "There are two cases in which we must beware of rash judgment: when it is not certain in what spirit something was done, or when it is not certain how a person will turn out, who now appears to be good or to be wicked." The first judgment is not a cause for condemnation, but the second and third are. </font></font><b><font size="3">176. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for you, the judge</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, he rejects the other excuse, namely, innocence. As if to say: The reason why you, the judge of others, condemn yourself is that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">you are doing the very same things </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">for which you condemn them; consequently, it seems that you are acting against your conscience: "Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?" (Mt 7:3). </font></font><b><font size="3">177. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">However, it should be noted that it is not always true, when someone judges another concerning a sin which he himself commits, that he automatically draws a condemnation upon himself, because he does not always sin mortally by so judging; yet he always reveals his own damnation. For if he is publicly guilty of the sin concerning which he judges another, he seems to be giving scandal by judging, unless perhaps he humbly reproves himself along with the other and laments his sin. </font></font>93 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But if he is secretly guilty of the same sin, he does not sin by judging another about the same sin, especially when he does so with humility and with an effort to rise again, as Augustine says in </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">The Lord’s Sermon on the Mount</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">: "When necessity compels us to correct someone, let us first examine whether it is a vice, such as we never had: and then let us reflect that we could have bad it or that we once had it and no longer have it: and then our common weakness will prod the memory, so that mercy and not hatred will guide that correction. But if we discover that we are presently guilty of the same vice, we should not scold but lament together and invite the other to join you in grieving." </font></font><b><font size="3">178. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">For we know </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">(v. 2), he discloses and commends God’s judgment. And concerning this he does three things. First, he declares the truth of God’s judgment; secondly, he rejects a contrary opinion, there [v. 3; n. 180] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Do you suppose</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">; thirdly, he manifests the truth, there [v. 6; n. 189] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Who will render</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></font><b><font size="3">179. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">First, therefore, he says: The reason I say that you condemn yourself, when you do the same things that you judge, is that we know, i.e., we hold it as certain, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do such things </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">i.e. God’s judgment threatens them: "The avenger of sin is the sword, that you may know there is a judgment" (Jb 19:29); "God will bring every deed into judgment" (Ec 12:14). We also know that this judgment will be based on the truth: "He will judge the earth with righteousness" (Ps 96:13). But man’s judgment, even though it be formed justly, is not always based on the truth of the affair, but on the words of witnesses, which sometimes clash with the truth. But this cannot happen in the divine judgment, because, as is said in Jer (21:23): "I am </font></font>94 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">the judge and witness."

For since man is not punished at once by God for sin, he supposes that he will not be punished, which is contrary to Si (4:5): "Do not say, ‘I sinned, and what happened to me? For the Lord is slow to anger"; "because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is fully set to do evil" (Ec 8:11) Yet the fact that the sinner does evil a hundred times and is patiently endured should not lead him to presume on God, but to conclude that it is good to fear Him.

The answer, as is held by some, is that it is more serious, i.e., more dangerous for some, because those who are ignorant of sin do not seek a remedy. Or it is most serious, if it is the form of ignorance that pertains to unbelief, which is the gravest sin: "If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized" (1 Cor 14:38). Or it is most serious in ingratitude, as Augustine says: "One who does not recognize a blessing is more ungrateful than one who belittles, i.e., scorns it." </font></font><b><font size="3">186. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">But by your hardness </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">(v. 5) he shows the danger of contempt, because it is not softened by the blessings of God’s goodness: "A hard heart will be afflicted at the end" (Si 4:26); </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">and impenitent heart</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, which is not moved to repent by God’s forbearance and patience: "No man repents of his wickedness" (Is 8:6), </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">you are storing up wrath for yourself</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">, i.e., you are multiplying the debt of punishment: "You have laid up a treasure of wrath for the last days" (Jas 5:3).

It is considered unforgivable both in this life and in the future, because the Jews were punished for this sin even in this life by the Romans and in the life to come by devils; or because it has no basis for being excused, unlike the blasphemy they spoke against Christ, inasmuch as He was a son of man: "Behold a glutton and a drunkard" (Mt 11:19). They could have been led to say this on account of the weakness of the flesh, as occurred even in the Old Testament, when the children of Israel complained about the lack of bread and water, as we read in Ex (16:2 ff). This could be considered a human failing and easy to forgive. But later on when they declared before an idol: "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt" (Ex 32:4), they sinned against the Holy Spirit, for they attributed God’s work to demons. Hence their sin is called unforgivable, when the Lord answers: "Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them" (Ex 32:34). Augustine, on the other hand, calls a sin against the Holy Spirit any word or blasphemy a person speaks against the Holy Spirit, through Whom sins are forgiven, as is stated in Jn (20:22): "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven." Indeed, this sin is committed in the heart, in word and in deed, as long as one continues in sin to the end. Consequently, final impenitence is a sin against the Spirit and of its very nature unforgivable. </font></font>98 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">Later teachers call a sin against the Holy Spirit one that is committed with deliberate malice, which is opposed to the goodness appropriated to the Holy Spirit, just as a sin against the Son of God is one committed from ignorance, which is opposed to the wisdom appropriated to the Son. Similarly, a sin against the Father is one committed through weakness, which is opposed to the power appropriated to the Father. Consequently, a sin against the Father and against the Son is deemed forgivable, because the very fact that it is committed from ignorance or from weakness seems to be a ground for excuse. But one committed from deliberate malice has no ground for excuse; hence, it is deemed unforgivable, because it has nothing in it to plead forgiveness; although God does forgive it sometimes, because He is good, just as He sometimes used His power to cure a naturally incurable disease. </font></font><b><font size="3">188. </font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">In light of the foregoing, six kinds of sin against the Holy Spirit are listed, each excluding something by which sin is forgiven. The first two are taken on the part of God, namely, hope in His mercy, to which is opposed despair, and fear of God’s justice, to which is opposed presumption. Two others are taken on the part of man, namely, contempt for the changeable good, to which is opposed obstinacy, which is here called hardness, through which a person hardens his soul to sin; and abandonment of the state of being turned away from God, to which is opposed an impenitent heart, which never intends to repent and return to God. The last two are taken on the part of God’s gifts, one of which is faith "by faith sins are cleansed," to which is opposed resistance to the acknowledged truth. The other is </font></font>99 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="3">charity: "Charity covers all offenses" (Pr 10:12), to which is opposed envy of a brother’s grace. </font></font><b>

First, he presents his intention; secondly, he manifests it, there [v. 7; n. 195] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">To those who by patience</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </font></font><b>190. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">First, he states facts about God’s judgment in regard to two things, namely, persons and their works. </font></font>100 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to works, God does not repay in the present life according to one’s works, for sometimes He gives grace to evil-doers, as to the apostle Paul, who obtained mercy after being a blasphemer and persecutor. But this will not be so on the day of judgment, when the time comes to judge according to justice: "At the set time which I appoint, I will judge with equity" (Ps 75:2); hence, another passage says: "Requite them according to their works" (Ps 28:4). With regard to persons, equality of retribution will be observed toward all: "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ" (2 Cor 5:10). </font></font><b>191. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">However, it seems that retribution will not be made according to one’s works, because an eternal punishment will be paid for a temporal sin. The answer, as Augustine says in the </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">City of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, is that in justice’s repayment equality in time between sin and punishment is not a consideration, because even in human judgment for a sin of adultery committed in a short time the death penalty is inflicted. Here the legislator is not interested in the time it takes to punish, but rather that the adulterer’s death will forever separate him from the society of the living. Thus, in his way man, too, punishes a temporal sin with an eternal punishment. Consequently, it is not strange if sins committed against charity, through which is formed a society between God and men, are punished eternally by the divine judgment. </font></font><b>192. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The justice of this is clear on three counts. First, on account of the infinite dignity of God Who is sinned against. For a sin is graver, the greater the dignity of the person sinned against, just as it is a greater crime to strike a prince than to strike a private citizen. Consequently, since the guilt of mortal sin </font></font>101 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is in a sense infinite, an infinite punishment should balance it. Therefore, since it cannot be infinite in intensity, it must be infinite in duration. </font></font><b>193. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, on account of the will of the sinner. For whoever sins mortally turns from the unchangeable good and fixes his end in a changeab1e good, as a fornicator in a pleasure of the flesh and a covetous person in money. And because the end is sought for itself, whoever seeks the end is borne toward it and wills to possess it always, if something else does not hinder. Hence, one who sins mortally has the will to remain in sin forever, unless something changes him accidentally, as when he fears punishment. Consequently, it is fitting that if a man through his will seeks sin to be enjoyed forever, he should be punished for it eternally. For God, Who sees the heart, directs His special attention to the will of the sinner. </font></font><b>194. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, on account of the effect of sin, namely, the withdrawal of grace, from which it follows that a man left to himself would remain forever in sin, from which he cannot be extricated except by the help of grace. But it is not fitting that, the sin remaining, the penalty should cease; consequently, the penalty lasts forever. The statement, to </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">render to every man according to his works</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, does not mean according to equality of works because the reward exceeds the merit, but according to proportion, because He will render good to the good and better to the better. The same applies to evil. </font></font><b>195. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">to those who by patience </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v. 7) he clarifies his statement: first, in regard to works; secondly, in regard to persons, there [v. 9b; n. 201] at </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">on every soul</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Three things combine or merit: first, patience, which can mean God’s patience as referred above: "Do you presume upon the riches of his goodness and patience?" (v.4). Then </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">those who by patience in well-doing </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">would be those who make good use of God’s patience by doing good. Or it can mean man’s patience, and this in two ways: in one way, so that patience implies tolerating adversity with equanimity of heart. For it is necessary that one not give up good works on account of the evils he suffers, and this is what he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by patience in well-doing</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. "Patience has a perfect work" (Jas 1:4); "By your patience you will gain your lives" (Lk 21:19). In another way, patience can be taken for long-suffering or for perseverance, which keeps a person from abandoning a good work on account of tedium: "You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand" (Jas 5:8); "you have need of patience" (Heb 10:36). The second feature of merit is the goodness of a work, which is good, if it is directed to its proper end and if it conforms to its proper rule, which is God’s law and human reason: "Let us not grow weary in well-doing" (Gal 6:9). The third feature is a right intention, i.e., to seek eternal life, so that in the evils a man suffers or in the good he does he is not seeking something temporal, but eternal: "Seek first the kingdom of God" (Mt 6:33).</font></font> 103 <b>197. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to the reward he touches on three things: the first is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">glory</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, which signifies the splendor of the saints: either intrinsic glory, with which the mind will be filled: "The Lord will fill your soul with brightness" (Is 58:11), or external glory, with which their body will shine: "The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father" (Mt 13:43); "Let the faithful exult in glory" (Ps 149:5). The second is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">honor</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, through which is signified the dignity of the saints and the reverence paid to them by every creature. For they will be kings and priests: "Thou hast made them a kingdom and priests to our God" (Rev 5:10) and will be numbered among the sons of God: "Why has he been numbered among the sons of God?" (Wis 5:5); "Thy friends are made exceedingly honorable, O God" (Ps 139:17). The third is </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">immortality</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, because that glory and honor will not pass, as they do in this world: "They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable" (1 Cor 9:25). </font></font><b>198. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but for those who are factious</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he shows the truth of a God’s judgment on the wicked and touches on sin and punishment. In regard to sin three things are mentioned. The first is the obstinacy of the factious, which can be understood of man toward God calling him to Himself by His blessings, against which a man seems to struggle by resisting them: "Behold, while I am yet alive with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord" (Dt 31:27). Secondly, it is understood of man’s struggle against faith: "Avoid disputing with words" (2 Ti 2:14). Thirdly, it can be understood of men struggling with one another, which is contrary to charity, the mother of the virtues: "Where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice" (Jas 3:16). </font></font>104 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The second is the hardness of those </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">who do not obey the truth</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. This can be understood in one way of the truth of faith: "If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?" (Jn 9:46); in another way, of the truth of God’s justice, to which they do not acquiesce, not believing the truth of His justice: "You say: ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’" (Ez 18:29). In a third way, it can be understood of the truth of life, in which they do not acquiesce who live perversely: "He who does what is true comes to the light" (Jn 3:21). The third is malice; hence, he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">but obey [believe] wickedness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, either because they consent to those who urge wickedness: "An evil-doer listens to wicked lips" (Pr 17:4); or because they believe that sins will not be punished, which would make God wicked: "Do not say: ‘I have sinned and what happened to me’?" (Si 5:4); or </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">they believe wickedness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., unbelief, namely, teachings against the faith: "So that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness" (2 Th 2:12). </font></font><b>199. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In regard to punishment four things are mentioned, which can be distinguished in two ways.

His </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fury </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">refers to the fact that He will consider sinners unworthy of eternal life: "I swore in my anger that they should not enter into my rest" (Ps 95:11).

Hence, it says in 2 Pt (2:2) that "God’s wrath rests upon unbelievers." </font></font><b>204. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he shows this in regard to the good: first, he repeats the two things mentioned above, namely, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">glory and honor</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, but the third, namely, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">peace</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he mentions instead of immortality, which includes peace among many other things. For a man’s peace cannot be complete as long as he fears he might lose the good things he has; rather, one has true peace of heart when he has everything he desires and no fear of losing then: "My people will abide in a peaceful habitation" (Is 32:18). In these things, too, he gives primacy to the Jews, because they were first promised to them, and the Gentiles entered into their promises: "Others have labored and you have entered into their labors" (Jn 4:38). </font></font>107 <b>205. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">God shows no partiality</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, he assigns the reason for his statement, namely, because there is no respect of persons with God: "Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality" (Ac 10:34). Respect of persons is opposed to distributive justice, through which one distributes to each according to the person’s worth; therefore, there is respect of persons, when more is given or less is given without regard to worth. This happens when the person rather than his qualifications is accepted as a cause. In this case there is a cause, i.e., a rule of action, but the person is taken as the cause of doing something. Thus, if one gives more inheritance to another on account of a blood relationship, it is not respect of persons, because this relationship is a fitting cause why he should receive such benefits. But if a prelate gives more ecclesiastical goods to someone on account of a blood relationship, it would be respect of persons, if some other qualification were not present. For blood relationship is not a suitable reason for receiving spiritual goods. Therefore, because God does everything for the best of reasons, respect of persons does not enter into His actions: "Wisdom orders all things well" (Wis 8:l). </font></font><b>206. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Yet He seems to be a respecter of persons, because He abandons some sinners and calls others to Himself. The answer is that respect of persons is opposed to justice; hence, it finds its sphere in the payment of debts, with which justice is concerned. But God calls sinners to repentance not from debt but as a favor: "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works" (Rom 11:6); "Not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy he saved us" (*** 3:5). </font></font>108 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">In such gifts not only God, but man too, is free to give to whom he will: "Am I not allowed to give what I choose with what belongs to me?"

For if all who sinned are punished, it is clear that there is no respect of persons with God. Hence, he speaks first of those who have not received the Law, saying that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">all who have sinned without the Law </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">received from God by Moses, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will perish without the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., will be condemned, but not for transgression of the Law: "Because no one understands, they will perish forever" (Job 4:20 Vul.). Secondly, he speaks of those who received the written law, and he says that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">all who have sinned under the Law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e. after the written Law, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">will be judged by the Law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., precisely for having transgressed a precept of the Law: "The word which I have spoken will be his judge on the last day" (Jn 12:48). </font></font><b>208. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The Apostle’s manner of speaking here has been taken as an occasion of error by some. Because the Apostle does not say that all who sinned under the Law will perish by the Law, as he had said of those who are without the Law that they will perish without the law, some believed that those who sin after receiving the law will be judged by some means, i.e., in the present, but will not perish. But as the Gloss [of Lombard, col. 1344] says: "What Christian would say that the Jew will not perish for not believing in Christ, when the Lord says that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for them" (Mt 10:15). Hence Ez (18:32) says: "I have no pleasure in the death of the sinner." </font></font>109 <b>209. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But the Apostle uses these different expressions because, as Gregory says on Jb (36:6): "He gives judgment to the poor," some will perish in the future judgment without being judged, i.e., the wicked who are without faith and the Law: "The wicked will not stand in the judgment" (Ps 1:5), namely, because there is no basis for discussion with one entirely estranged from God: "He who does not believe is condemned" (Jn 3:18). But others who sin in spite of having received the Law and faith will perish in such a way as also to be judged through a discussion held with them; hence, Ez (34:17): "I judge between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats," just as a king condemns enemies without a hearing, but citizens with a careful examination, as Gregory says. </font></font></font><b><br />

Consequently, no one is justified precisely for doing the works of the Law. The answer is that justification can be taken in three ways: in one way, in regard to reputation; then one is said to be justified, when he is regarded as just: "You have made your sisters appear justified," i.e., by reputation (Ez 16:51). In this sense, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the doers of the law are justified</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., are considered just before God and men. Secondly, by doing what is just: "This man went down to his home justified" (Lk 18:14), because the publican performed a work of justice by confessing his sin. In this way is verified the statement that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">the doers of the law will be justified</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., by performing the justices of the Law. In a third way justification can be considered in regard to the cause of justice, so that a person is said to be justified, when he newly receives justice, as in (5:1): "Since we are justified by faith, we are at peace with God." It must not be supposed, however, that the doers of the Law are justified as though acquiring justice through the works of the Law. This cannot be accomplished either by the ceremonial works, which confer no </font></font>112 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">justifying grace, or by the moral works, from which the habit of justice is not acquired; rather, we do such works in virtue of an infused habit of justice. </font></font><b>213. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">For when Gentiles who </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v.14) he clarifies his position.

For the Law was not delivered to the Gentiles but to the Jews: "The law which Moses commanded us as an inheritance for the congregations of Jacob" (Si 24:24); "He has not dealt thus with any other nation" (Ps 147:20); "When Moses commanded us a law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob" (Dt 33:4). From this it is clear that the Gentiles did not sin by not observing the ceremonies of the Law. </font></font>113 <b>215. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Secondly, he commends their observance of law, when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">they do by nature what the law requires</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., the moral precepts, which flow from a dictate of natural reason. Thus Job (1:1) was blameless and upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. Hence he himself says: "My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his ways" (Jb 23:11). </font></font><b>216. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But the expression, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by nature</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, causes some difficulty. For it seems to favor the Pelagians, who taught that man could observe all the precepts of the Law by his own natural powers. Hence, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by nature </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">should mean nature reformed by grace. For he is speaking of Gentiles converted to the faith, who began to obey the moral precepts of the Law by the help of Christ’s grace. Or </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">by nature </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">can mean by the natural law showing them what should be done, as in Ps 4 (v.6): "There are many who say, ‘Who shows us good things!’ The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us," i.e., the light of natural reason, in which is God’s image. All this does not rule out the need of grace to move the affections any more than the knowledge of sin through the Law (Rom 3:20) exempts from the need of grace to move the affections. </font></font><b>217. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Thirdly, he shows their worth in that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, inasmuch as they function as a law to themselves by instructing and inducing themselves to the good, because the Philosopher says: Law is a statement laying down an obligation and proceeding from prudence and understanding (</font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Eth</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. 11). Therefore, it says in 1 Tim (l:9) that "the law is not laid down for the just," who is not compelled by a law outside of him, "but for the lawless," who need to be compelled from without. </font></font>114 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">It is, of course, the highest level of greatness among men, when they are induced toward the good not by others but by themselves. The second level belongs to those who are induced by others but without force. The third belongs to those who need to be forced to do good. The fourth belongs to those who cannot be directed to the good even by force: "In vain have I smitten your children; they took no correction" (Jer 2:30). </font></font><b>218. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">They show </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v. 15) he explains how they are a law to themselves. This can be likened to a law presented to man from without and which it is customary to deliver in writing on account of the memory’s weakness; whereas, those who observe the law without externally hearing the law show </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">that what the law requires is written </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">"not with ink, but" first and chiefly "with the Spirit of the living God" (2 Cor 3:3), and secondly through study: "Write them on the tablet of your heart" (Pr 3:3), i.e., the precepts of wisdom.

First [cf. n. 222], he mentions those actions, one of which is the witness of conscience. He touches on this when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">while their conscience also bears witness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, conscience being the application of one’s knowledge in judging whether some action was good or bad to do. </font></font>115 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Hence, this conscience sometimes gives testimony of good: "Our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience" (2 Cor 1:12); and sometimes of evil: "Your conscience knows that many times you have yourself cursed others" (Ec 7:23). However, no one can testify that an action is good or bad, unless he has knowledge of the Law. Hence, if conscience bears witness about good or evil, this is a clear sign that the work of the Law has been written in the man’s heart. </font></font><b>220. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Another function is to accuse and defend.

For an accusing thought in regard to some action arises in a man, when he has reason to suppose that he has acted evilly: "Mow I rebuke you and lay the charge before you" (Ps 50:21); "The show of their countenance witnesses against them" (Is 3:9). But sometimes a defending thought arises, when he has reason to suppose that he has acted well: "My heart does not reproach me for any of my days" (Jb 27:6). Between this accusation and defense the testimony of conscience has the final say. </font></font><b>221. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">This passage, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">their conscience bears witness</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, can be interpreted in another way, so that there is consciousness not only of one’s deeds but also of thoughts; but the first is better. </font></font><b>222. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">But because testimony, accusation, and defense occur during a trial, he mentions the time, when he says, </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">on that day</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Yet it is sometimes called night on account of the uncertainty of that hour: "At midnight there was a cry" (Mt 25:6). The accusing or defending thoughts are not those which will arise on the day of judgment, because on that day each one’s salvation or damnation will be clear to him; rather, such thoughts as exist now and the testimony of conscience that exists now will be represented to a man on that day by divine power, as Augustine says in book 2 of </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">The City of God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">.

Rather, it seems that the Jews were named after the patriarch Judah: "Judah, your brothers shall praise you" (Gen 49:8); for in the time of Roboam, when ten tribes seceded from his kingdom and adored a golden calf, they were led away captive by the Assyrians (1 Sam l7). Scripture makes no mention of their return; rather, the land remained occupied by strangers later called Samaritans. But two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, remained in the kingdom of Roboam and persevered in the word of God. Although they were led away captive to Babylon, they were permitted to return to their native land by Cyrus, the Persian king (1 Ezra 1).

The reason is that </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">he is </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">truly </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a Jew who is one inwardly</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., whose heart is possessed by the precepts of the Law, which the Jews professed: "Your father who sees in secret will repay you" (Mt 6:6). Again, true circumcision </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">is of the heart in the spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., made by one’s spirit, which expels superfluous thoughts from the heart. Or </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">in the spirit</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., effected by a </font></font>127 <font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">spiritual and </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">not a literal </font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">understanding of the Law: "For we are the true circumcision who worship God in spirit" (Phil 3:3). </font></font><b>245. </b><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Then when he says </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">His praise </font></font></i></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">(v29b) he proves this reason. For it is obvious that in all matters the divine judgment must prevail over the human. Now things that appear outwardly, such as Judaism or circumcision, are praised by men, but things that exist within are judged according to God’s judgment, because "man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart" (1 Sam 16:7). <br /><br />Hence, inward Judaism and circumcision prevail over the outward. And this is what he says: </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">His [whose] praise</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">, i.e., of inward circumcision, is not </font></font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">from men but from God</font></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">: "It is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends" (2 Cor 10:18). </font></font></font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

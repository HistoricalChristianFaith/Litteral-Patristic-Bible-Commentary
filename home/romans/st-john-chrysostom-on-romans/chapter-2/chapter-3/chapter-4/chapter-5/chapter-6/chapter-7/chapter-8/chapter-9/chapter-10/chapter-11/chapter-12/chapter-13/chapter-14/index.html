<div>Romans XIV. 1, 2 
<p><q>Him that is weak in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. For one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believes</font></u></a> that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eats herbs.</q></p>
<p>I Am aware that to most what is here said is a difficulty. And therefore I must first give the subject of the whole of this passage, and what he wishes to correct in writing this. What does he wish to correct then? There were many of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, who adhered of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> to the Law, and after their believing, still kept to the observance of meats, as not having <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> yet to quit the service of the Law entirely. Then that they might not be observed if they kept from swine's flesh only, they abstained in consequence from all flesh, and ate herbs only, that what they were doing might have more the appearance of a fast than of observance of the Law. Others again were farther advanced, (<span>τελειότεροι</span>) and kept up no one thing of the kind, who became to those, who did keep them, distressing and offensive, by reproaching them, accusing them, driving them to despondency. Therefore the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>, out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> lest, from a wish to be right about a trifle, they should overthrow the whole, and from a wish to bring them to indifferency about what they ate, should put them in a fair way for deserting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and out of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> to put everything right at once, before the fit opportunity had come, should do mischief on vital points, so by this continual rebuking setting them adrift from their agreement in (<span>ὁ</span> <span>μολογίας εἰς</span>) Christ, and so they should remain not righted in either respect: observe what great judgment he uses and how he concerns himself with both interests with his customary wisdom. For neither does he venture to say to those who rebuke, You are doing amiss, that he may not seem to be confirming the other in their observances; nor again, You are doing right, lest he should make them the more vehement accusers: but he makes his rebuke to square with each. And in appearance he is rebuking the stronger, but he pours forth all he has to say against the other in his address to these. For the kind of correction most likely to be less grating is, when a person addresses some one else, while he is striking a blow at a different person, since this does not permit the person rebuked to fly into a passion, and introduces the medicine of correction unperceived. See now with what judgment he does this, and how well-timed he is with it. For after saying, <q>make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lusts</font></u></a> thereof,</q> then he proceeds to the discussion of these points, that he might not seem to be speaking in defence of those who were the rebukers, and were for eating of anything. For the weaker part ever requires more forethought. Wherefore he aims his blow against the strong, immediately saying as follows, <q>Him that is weak in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> You see one blow immediately given to him. For by calling him weak (<span>ἀ</span> <span>σθενοὕντα</span>), he points out that he is not healthy (<span>ἄ</span> <span>ρρωστον</span>). Then he adds next, <q>receive,</q> and point out again that he requires much attention. And this is a sign of extreme debility. <q>Not to doubtful disputations.</q> See, he has laid on a third stripe. For here he makes it appear that his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> is of such a nature, that even those who do not transgress in the same manner, and who nevertheless admit him to their affection, and are earnestly bent upon curing him, are at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>. You see how in appearance he is conversing with these, but is rebuking others secretly and without giving offense. Then by placing them beside each other, one he gives encomiums, the other accusations. For he goes on to say, <q>One <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believes</font></u></a> that he may eat all things,</q> commending him on the score of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. <q>Another who is weak, eats herbs,</q> disparaging this one again, on the score of his weakness. Then since the blow he had given was deadly (<span>καιρίαν</span>, used hyperbolically), he comforts him again in these words,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 3</font></u></a>. <q>Let not him that eats, despise him that eats not.</q></p>
<p>He does not say, let him alone, nor does he say, do not blame him, nor yet, do not set him right; but do not reproach him, do not <q>despise</q> him, to show they were doing a thing perfectly ridiculous. But of this he speaks in other words. <q>Let not him which eats not, judge him that eats.</q> For as the more advanced made light of these, as of little <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> healed, and spurious, and still Judaizers, so they too judged these as law-breakers, or as given to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a>. And of these it is likely that many were of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> too. Wherefore he proceeds, for God has received him. But in the other's case he does not say this. And yet to be despised was the eater's share, as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glutton</font></u></a>, but to be judged, his that did not eat, as of little <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. But he has made them change places, to show that he not only does not deserve to be despised, but that he can even despise. But do I condemn him? He means. By no means. For this is why he proceeds, <q>for God has received him.</q> Why then do you speak to him of the law, as to a transgressor? <q>For God has received him:</q> that is, has shown His unspeakable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> about him, and has freed him from all charges against him; then again he turns to the strong.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 4</font></u></a>. <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant?</q></p>
<p>Whence it appears that they too judged, and did not despise only. <q>To his own Master he stands or falls.</q> See here is another stroke. And the indignation seems to be against the strong man, and he attacks him. When he says, <q>Yea, he shall be holden up,</q> he shows that he is still wavering, and requires so much attention as to call in God as a physician for this, <q>for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>is able to make him stand.</q> And this we say of things we are quite in despair about. Then, that he may not despair he both gives him the name of a servant when he says, <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant?</q> And here again he secretly attacks him. For it is not because he does things worthy to exempt him from being judged, that I bid you not judge him, but because he is Another's servant, that is, not yours, but God's. Then to solace him again he does not say, <q>falls,</q> but what? <q>stands or falls.</q> But whether it be the latter or the former, either of these is the Master's concernment, since the loss also goes to Him, if he does fall, as the riches too, if he stand. And this again if we do not attend to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> aim in not wishing them to be rebuked before a fitting opportunity, is very unworthy of the mutual care becoming for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>. But (as I am always saying) we must examine the mind with which it is spoken, and the subject on which it is said and the object he would compass when he says it. But he makes them respectful by no slight motive, when he says this: for what he means is, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, Who undergoes the loss, hitherto does nothing, how can you be else than ill-timed and out of all measure exact, when you seize on (<span>ἄ</span> <span>γκων</span>, throttle) him and annoy him?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 5</font></u></a>. <q>One man esteems one day above another, another esteems every day alike.</q></p>
<p>Here he seems to me to be giving a gentle hint about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>. For it is not unlikely that some who fasted were always judging those who did not, or among the observances it is likely that there were some that on fixed days abstained, and on fixed days did not. Whence also he says, <q>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</q> And in this way he released those who kept the observances from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, by saying that the thing was indifferent, and he removed also the quarrelsomeness of those who attacked them, by showing that it was no very desirable (or urgent, <span>περισπούδαστον</span>) task to be always making a trouble about these things. Yet it was not a very desirable task, not in its own nature, but on account of the time chosen, and because they were novices in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. For when he is writing to the Colossians, it is with great earnestness that he forbids it, saying, <q>Beware lest any man spoil you through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> and vain deceit, after the traditions of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col002.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 2:8</font></u></a>, see p. 4</span> And again, <q>Let no man judge you in meat or in drink</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col002.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 2:16</font></u></a></span>, and, <q>let no man beguile you of your reward.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col002.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 2:18</font></u></a></span> And when writing to the Galatians with great precision, he exacts of them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> spirit and perfectness in this matter. But here he does not use this vehemency, because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> was lately planted in them. Let us therefore not apply the phrase, <q>Let every man be persuaded in his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>,</q> to all subjects. For when he is speaking of doctrines, hear what he says, <q>If any one preaches unto you any gospel other than that you have received, let him be accursed</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal001.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"></a></span><u><font color="#0000ff">, <q>even</q> if it be </font></u><q><u><font color="#0000ff">an </font></u><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>.</q> And again, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co011.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 11:3</font></u></a></span> And in writing to the Philippians, he says, <q>Beware of dogs, beware of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> workers, beware of the concision.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:2</font></u></a></span> But with the Romans, since it was not yet the proper time for setting things of this sort right, <q>Let every man,</q> he says, <q>be fully persuaded in his own mind.</q> For he had been speaking of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>. It was to clear away the vanity of the others and to release these from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> then, that he said as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 6</font></u></a>. <q>He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it.</q> And, <q>He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.</q></p>
<p>He still keeps to the same subject. And what he means is about this. The thing is not concerned with fundamentals. For the thing requisite is, if this person and the other are acting for God's sake, the thing requisite is (these words are repeated 3 manuscripts), if both terminate in thanksgiving. For indeed both this man and that give thanks to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. If then both do give thanks to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the difference is no great one. But let me draw your notice to the way in which here also he aims unawares a blow at the Judaizers. For if the thing required be this, the <q>giving of thanks,</q> it is plain enough that he which eats it is that <q>gives thanks,</q> and not <q>he which eats not.</q> For how should he, while he still holds to the Law? As then he told the Galatians, <q>As many of you as are justified by the Law are fallen from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 5:4</font></u></a></span>; so here he hints it only, but does not unfold it so much. For as yet it was not time to do so. But for the present he bears with it (see p. 337): but by what follows he gives it a further opening. For where he says,</p>
<p>Ver. 7, 8. <q>For none of us lives unto himself, and no man dies unto himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord,</q> by this too he makes the same clearer. For how can he that lives unto the Law, be living unto Christ? But this is not the only thing that he effects by this, he also holds back the person who was in so much haste for their being set right, and persuades him to be patient, by showing that it is impossible for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> to despise them, but that in due time He will set them right. What is the force then of <q>none of us lives to himself?</q> It means, We are not free, we have a Master who also would have us live, and wills not that we die, and to whom both of these are of more interest than to us. For by what is here said he shows that he has a greater concern for us than we have ourselves, and considers more than we do, as well our life to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, as our death to be a loss. For we do not die to ourselves alone, but to our Master also, if we do die. But by death here he means that from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. However, this were enough to convince us that He takes care for us, in that it is to Him we live, and to Him we die. Still he is not satisfied with saying this, but proceeds further. For after saying, <q>Whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's,</q> and passing from that death to the physical one, that he may not give an appearance of harshness to his language, he gives another very great indication of His care for us. Now of what kind is this?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 9</font></u></a>. <q>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living.</q></p>
<p>And so let us at least convince you, that He is thoughtful for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. For had He not had this great care for us, where were the need of the Dispensation (or Incarnation, <span>οἰκονομίας</span>)? He then that has shown so much anxiety about our becoming His, as to take the form of a servant, and to die, will He despise us after we have become so? This cannot be so, assuredly it cannot! Nor would He choose to waste so much pains. <q>For to this end (he says) he also died,</q> as if any one were to say, Such an one will not have the heart to despise his servant. For he minded his own purse. <span>Cf. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo021.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 21:21</font></u></a></span> For indeed we are not so much in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> with money, as is He with our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. Wherefore it was not money, but His own Blood that He gave as bail for us. And for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> He would not have the heart to give them up, for whom He had laid down so great a price. See too how he shows that His power also is unspeakable. For he says, <q>to this end He both died and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</q> And above he said, <q>for whether we live or die, we are His.</q> See what a wide extended Mastery! see what unconquerable might! see what exact <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> over us! For tell me not, he means, of the living. Even for the departed He takes care. But if He does of the departed, it is quite plain that He does of the living also. For He has not omitted any point for this Mastery, making out for Himself more claims than men do, and especially beside all other things in order to take care of us. For a man puts down money, and for this clings strongly to his own slave. But He Himself paid down His death; and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of one who was purchased at so great a price, and the Mastery over whom He had gained with so much anxiety and trouble, He is not likely to count of no value. But this he says to make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judaizer</font></u></a> abashed, and to persuade him to call to mind the greatness of the benefit, and how that when dead he had come to be alive, and that there was nothing that he gained from the Law, and how that it would be the last degree of unfeelingness, to leave Him Who had shown so much care toward him, and run away back to the Law. After attacking him then sufficiently, he relaxes again, and says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 10</font></u></a>. <q>But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you set at nought your brother?</q></p>
<p>And so he seems to be setting them upon a level, but from that he has said, he shows that the difference between them is great. First then by the appellation of <q>brother</q> he does away with disputatiousness, and then also by calling that awful day to their mind. For after saying, <q>Why do you set at nought your brother?</q> he proceeds, <q>For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>And he seems indeed to be again rebuking the more advanced in saying this, but he is putting the mind of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judaizer</font></u></a> to confusion by not only calling for his reverence to the benefit that had been done him, but also making him afraid of the punishment to come. <q>For we shall all,</q> he says, <q>stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Ver. 11, 12. <q>For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>See how he again puts his mind into confusion, while he seems to be rebuking the other. For he intimates some such thing, as if he had said, How does it affect you? Are you to be punished for him? But this he does not say, but hints at it by putting it in a milder form, and saying, <q>For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ:</q> and, <q>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> And he introduces the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the subjection of all to Him, yea a subjection extended even to those in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>, and of all absolutely. For he does not barely say every one shall worship, but <q>shall confess,</q> that is, shall given an account of what he has done. Be in anxiety then as seeing the Master of all sitting on his judgment-seat, and do not make schisms and divisions in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, by breaking away from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, and running over to the Law. For the Law also is His. And why say I so of the Law? Even those in the Law and those before the Law are His. And it is not the Law that will demand an account of you, but Christ, of you and of all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human race</font></u></a>. See how he has released us from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the Law. Then that he may not seem to be saying this to frighten them for the occasion, but to have come to it in the course he had proposed himself, he again keeps to the same subject, and says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 13</font></u></a>. <q>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</q></p>
<p>This does not apply to one less than the other: wherefore it may well fit with both, both the advanced man that was offended at the observance of meats, and the unadvanced that stumbled at the vehement rebuke given him. But consider, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, the great punishment we shall suffer, if we give offense at all. For if in a case where the thing was against law, yet, as they rebuked unseasonably, he forbade their doing it, in order that a brother might not be made to offend and stumble; when we give an offense without having anything to set right even, what treatment shall we deserve? For if not saving others be a crime (and that it is so, he who buried the talent proves), what will be the effect of giving him offense also? But what if he gives himself the offense, you may say, by being weak? Why this is just why you ought to be patient. For if he were strong, then he would not require so much attention. But now, since he is of the feebler sort, he does on this ground need considerable care. Let us then yield him this, and in all respects bear his burdens, as it is not of our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> only that we shall have to give an account, but for those also wherein we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> others to offend. For if that account, were even by itself hard to pass, when these be added too, how are we to be saved? And let us not suppose, that if we can find accomplices in our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, that will be an excuse; as this will prove an addition to our punishment. Since the serpent too was punished more than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, as was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> likewise more than the man <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti002.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 2:14</font></u></a></span>; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08404a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jezebel</font></u></a> also was punished more severely than Ahab, who had seized the vineyard; for it was she that devised the whole matter, and caused the king to offend. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki021.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 21:23-29</font></u></a></span> And therefore thou, when you are the author of destruction to others, wilt suffer more severely than those who have been subverted by you. For sinning is not so ruinous as leading others also into the same. Wherefore he speaks of those who <q>not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:32</font></u></a></span> And so when we see any sinning, let us, so far from thrusting them on, even pull them back from the pit of iniquity, that we may not have to be punished for the ruin of others besides ourselves. And let us be continually in mind of the awful judgment-seat, of the stream of fire, of the chains never to be loosed, of the darkness with no light, the gnashing of teeth, and the venomous worm. <q>Ah, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is merciful!</q> Are these then mere words? And was not that rich man punished for despising Lazarus? Are not the foolish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a> cast out of the Bride-chamber? Do not they who did not feed Him go away into <q>the fire prepared for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:41</font></u></a></span> Will not he that has soiled garments be <q>bound hand and foot</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:13</font></u></a></span>, and go to ruin? Will, not he that demanded the hundred pence to be paid, be given over to the tormentors? Is not that said of the adulterers <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, that <q>their worm shall not die, nor their fire be quenched?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar009.htm#verse43" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 9:43</font></u></a></span> Are these but mere threats then? Yea, it is answered. And from what source <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> do you venture to make such an assertion, and that too when you pass judgment of your own opinion? Why, I shall be able to prove the contrary, both from what He said, and from what He did. <span>See <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:22</font></u></a></span> For if you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> by the punishments that are to come, at least <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> by those that have happened already. For what have happened, and have come forth into reality, surely are not threats and words. Who then was it that flooded the whole world, and affected that baleful wreck, and the utter destruction of our whole race! Who was it that after this hurled those thunders and lightnings upon the land of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>? Who that drowned all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> in the sea? Who that consumed the six hundred thousand men in the wilderness? Who that burnt up the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogue</font></u></a> of Abiram? Who that bade the earth open her mouth for the company of Core and Dathan, and swallow them up? Who that carried off the threescore and ten thousand at one sweep in David's time? Shall I mention also those that were punished individually! Cain, who was given up to a continual vengeance? (the son of) Charmi, who was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> with his whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>? Or him, that suffered the same thing for gathering sticks on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sabbath</font></u></a>? The forty children who were consumed by those beasts, and obtained no pardon even on the score of their age? And if you would see these same things even after the times of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, just consider what great suffering the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> had, how the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> ate their children, some roasting them, and some consuming them in other ways: how after being given up to irremediable famine, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> varied and severe, they threw all previous catastrophes into the shade by the exceeding greatness of their own calamities. For that it was Christ Who did these things unto them, hear Him declaring as much, both by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, and clearly and explicitly. By <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, as when He says, <q>But those that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk019.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 19:27</font></u></a></span>; and by that of the vineyard, and that of the marriage. But clearly and explicitly, as when He threatens that they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nations</font></u></a>, and there shall be upon the earth <q>distress of nations with perplexity, at the roaring of the sea and waves; men's hearts failing them for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.</q> (ib. 21:24, 25, 26.) <q>And there shall be tribulation, such as there never was, no, nor ever shall be.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:21</font></u></a></span> And what a punishment Ananias too and Sapphira suffered, for the theft of a few pieces of money, you all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. Do you see not the daily calamities also? Or have these too not taken place? Do you see not now men that are pining with famine? Those that suffer elephantiasis, or are maimed in body? Those that live in constant poverty, those that suffer countless irreparable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>? Now then will it be reasonable for some to be punished, and some not? For if God be not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a> (and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a> He is not), thou also wilt assuredly suffer punishment, if you sin. But if because He is merciful He does not punish, then ought not these either to have been punished. But now because of these words of yours, God even here punishes many, that when you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not the words of the threatening, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of vengeance ye may at least <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And since things of old do not affright you so much, by things which happen in every generation, He corrects those that in every generation are growing listless. And what is the reason, it may be said, why He does not punish all here? That He may give the others an interval for repentance. Why then does He not take vengeance upon all in the next world? It is lest many should disbelieve in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>. How many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> are there who have been taken, and how many that have left this life unpunished? Where is the mercy of God then? It is my turn now to ask of you. For supposing no one at all had vengeance taken upon him, then you might have taken refuge in this. But now that some are punished, and some are not, though they be the worse sinners, how can it be reasonable that there be not the same punishments for the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>? How can those punished appear to be else than wronged? What reason is there then why all are not punished here? Hear His own defence for these things. For when some had died by the falling of a tower on them: He said to those who raised a question upon this, <q>Suppose ye that they were sinners above all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>? I tell you nay, but except ye repent, you shall all likewise perish</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk013.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 13:4-5</font></u></a></span>; so exhorting us not to feel confident when others suffer punishment, and we ourselves, though we have committed many transgressions, do not. For except we change our conduct, we assuredly shall suffer. And how, it may be said, is it that we are to be punished without end for sinning a short time here? How, I ask, is it that in this world, those who in a short moment of time have done one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, are condemned to constant punishment in the mines? <q>But it is not God that does this,</q> it may be said. How then came He to keep the man with a palsy for thirty and eight years in so great punishments? For that it was for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> that He punished him, hear what He says, <q>Behold, you are made whole, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> no more.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:14</font></u></a></span> Still it is said, he found a release. But the case is not so with the other life. For that there, there will never be any release, hear from His own mouth, <q>Their worm will not die, nor their fire be quenched.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar009.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 9:44</font></u></a></span> And <q>these shall go into everlasting life, but these into everlasting punishment.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:46</font></u></a></span> Now if the life be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>, the punishment is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>. Do you see not how severely He threatened the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? Then have the things threatened come to pass, or were those that were told them a mere talk? <q>One stone shall not remain upon another.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk021.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 21:6</font></u></a></span> And has it remained? But what, when He says, <q>There shall be tribulation such as has not been?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:21</font></u></a></span> Has it not come then? Read the history of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08522a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Josephus</font></u></a>, and you will not be able to draw your breath even, at only hearing what they suffered for their doings. This I say, not that I may pain you, but that I may make you secure, and lest by having humored you overmuch, I should but make a way for the endurance of sorer punishments. For why, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, do you not deem it right you should be punished for sinning? Hath He not told you all beforehand? Hath He not threatened you? Not come to your aid? not done things even without number for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation's</font></u></a> sake? Gave He you not the laver of Regeneration, and forgave He not all your former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>? Hath He not after this forgiveness, and the laver, also given you the succor of repentance if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Hath He not made the way to forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, even after all this, easy to you? Hear then what He has enjoined: <q>If you forgive your neighbor, I also will forgive you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:14</font></u></a></span>, He says.

And will you not be persuaded even after this that there is punishment and vengeance? At that rate you will deny that even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> is punished. For, <q>Depart,</q> He says, <q>into the fire prepared for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:41</font></u></a></span> Now if there be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, then neither is he punished. But if he is punished, it is plain that we shall also. For we also have disobeyed, even if it be not in the same way. And how do you come not to be afraid to speak such daring things? For when you say that God is merciful, and does not punish, if He should punish he will be found in your case to be no longer merciful. See then unto what language the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> leads you? And what are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10487b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">monks</font></u></a> that have taken up with the mountains, and yield examples of such manifold self-denial, to go away without their crown?

Nay, it will be said, For this is suitable with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that there should be a kingdom only, and not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. Well then, shall the whoremonger, and the adulterer, and the man who has done <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> unnumbered, enjoy the same advantages with the man who has exhibited soberness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> is to stand with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a>, or rather even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>?

And who would say this? Who even of men that were quite crazed? Or rather, which of the devils even would say this? For even they confess that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>.

<p>How then do you come not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and tremble, when even the devils confess what yourself art denying? Or how is it that thou dost not see who is the teacher of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doctrines? For he who deceived the first man, and under the pretext of greater hopes, threw them out even of the blessings they had in possession, he it is who now suggests the saying and fancying of these things. And for this reason he persuades some to suspect there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, that he may thrust them into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. As God on the other hand threatens <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> ready, that by coming to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> of it you might so live as not to fall into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. And yet if, when there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> persuades you to these things, how came the devils to confess it, if it did not exist, whose aim and desire it is that we should not suspect anything of the kind, that through fearlessness we might become the more listless, and so fall with them into that fire? How then (it will be said) came they to confess it? It was through their not bearing the compulsion laid upon them. Taking all these things into consideration then, let those who talk in this way leave off deceiving both themselves and others since even for these words of theirs they will be punished for detracting (<span>διασύροντες</span>) from those awful things, and relaxing the vigor of many who are minded to be in earnest, and do not even do as much as those barbarians, for they, though they were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of everything, when they heard that the city was to be destroyed, were so far from disbelieving, that they even groaned, and girded themselves with sackcloth, and were confounded, and did not cease to use every means until they had allayed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon003.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jonah 3:5</font></u></a></span> But do you, who hast had so great experience of facts and of teaching, make light of what is told you? The contrary then will be your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a>. For as they through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the words had not to undergo the vengeance in act, so thou who despisest the threatening by words, wilt have to undergo the punishment in very deed. And if now what you are told seems a fable to you, it will not, however, seem so when the very things convince you, in that Day. Have you never noticed what He did even in this world? How when He met with two thieves, He counted them not worthy of the same estate, but one He led into the Kingdom, and the other He sent away into Hell? And why speak I of a robber and murderer? For even the Apostle He did not spare, when he had become a traitor, but even when He saw him rushing to the halter, and hanging, and bursting asunder in the midst (for he did <q>burst asunder, and all his bowels gushed out</q>) <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 1:18</font></u></a></span>, still when He foresaw all these things, He let him suffer all the same, giving you from the present a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of all that is in the other world also. Do not then cheat yourselves, through being persuaded of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. These devices are his. For if both judges, and masters, and teachers, and savages, respect the good, and punish the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, with what reason is the contrary to be the case with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, while the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man and he who is not so are deemed worthy of the same estate? And when will they leave off their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>? For they who now are expecting punishment, and are among so many terrors, those from the judges and from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, and yet do not for this depart from iniquity; when on their departing this life they are to lay aside even this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and are not only not to be cast into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, but are even to obtain a kingdom; when will they leave doing wickedly?

To add to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, to set up rewards for iniquity, to count the sober and the unchastened, the faithful and the irreligious, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, to have the same deserts?

<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rom. XIV. 14</font></u></a></p>
<p><q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, and am persuaded by (Gr. in) the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord Jesus</font></u></a>, that there is nothing unclean of itself, but to him that esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</q></p>
<p>After first rebuking the person who judges his brother, and moving him to leave off this reproaching, he then explains himself further upon the doctrinal part, and instructs in a dispassionate tone the weaker sort, displaying in this case too a great deal of gentleness. For he does not say he shall be punished, nor anything of the sort, but merely disburdens him of his fears in the matter, and that with a view to his being more easily persuaded with what he tells him; and he says, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, and am persuaded.</q> And then to prevent any of those who did not trust him (or <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>,</q> <span>τὥν οὐ πιστὥν</span>) saying, And what is it to us if you are persuaded? For you are no trustworthy evidence to be set in competition with so great a law, and with oracles brought down from above, he proceeds, <q>in the Lord.</q> That is, as having learned from Him, as having my confidence from Him. The judgment then is not one of the mind of man. What is it that you are persuaded of and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>? Tell us. <q>That there is nothing unclean of itself.</q> By nature, he says, nothing is unclean but it becomes so by the spirit in which a man uses it. Therefore it becomes so to himself only, and not to all. <q>For to him that esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</q> What then? Why not correct your brother, that he may think it not unclean? Why not with full authority call him away from this habit of mind and conception of things, that he may never make it common? My reason is, he says, I am afraid to grieve him. Wherefore he proceeds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 15</font></u></a>. <q>But if your brother be grieved with your meat, now you do not walk charitably.</q></p>
<p>You see how far, for the present, he goes in affection for him, showing that he makes so great account of him, that with a view not to grieve him he does not venture even to enjoin things of great urgency, but by yieldingness would rather draw him to himself, and by charity. For even when he has freed him of his fears, he does not drag him and force him, but leaves him his own master. For keeping a person from meats is no such matter as overwhelming with grief. You see how much he insists upon charity. And this is because he is aware that it can do everything. And on this ground he makes somewhat larger demand upon them. For so far he says from its being proper for them to distress you at all, they ought even, if need be, not to hesitate at condescending to you. Whence he proceeds to say, <q>Destroy not him with your meat, for whom Christ died.</q> Or do you not value your brother enough even to purchase his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> at the price of abstinence from meats? And yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> refused not to become a slave, nor yet to die for him; but thou dost not despise even food, that you may save him. And yet with it all Christ was not to gain all, yet still He died for all; so fulfilling His own part. But are you aware that by meat you are overthrowing him in the more important matters, and yet makest a disputing? And him who is the object of such care unto Christ, do you consider so contemptible, and dishonor one whom He loves? Yet He died not for the weak only, but even for an enemy. And will you not refrain from meats even, for him that is weak? Yet Christ did what was greatest even, but thou not even the less. And He was Master, thou a brother. These words then were enough to tongue-tie him. For they show him to be of a little spirit, and after having the benefit of great things from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, not to give in return even little ones.</p>
<p>Ver. 16, 17. <q>Let not then your good be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spoken of. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink.</q></p>
<p>By their <q>good,</q> he means here either their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, or the hope of rewards hereafter, or the perfectness of their religious state. For it is not only that you fail to profit your brother, he means, but the doctrine itself, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and His gift, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spoken of. Now when you fight, when you quarrel, when you are vexatious, when you make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a> in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and reproachest your brother, and art distant with him, those that are without will speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of you. And so good is so far from coming of this, that just the opposite is the case. For your good is charity, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of the brotherhood, being united, being bound together, living at peace, living in gentleness (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιεικείας</span>). He again, to put an end to his fears and the other's disputatiousness, says, <q>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink.</q> Is it by these, he means, that we are to be approved? As he says in another passage too, <q>Neither if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse.</q> And he does not need any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>, but is content with stating it. And what he says is this, If you eat, does this lead you to the Kingdom? And this was why, by way of satirizing them as mightily pleased with themselves herein, he said, not <q>meat</q> only, but <q>drink.</q> What then are the things that do bring us here? <q>Righteousness, and peace, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>,</q> and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> life, and peace with our brethren (whereto this quarrelsomeness is opposed), the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> from unanimity, which this rebuking puts an end to. But this he said not to one party only, but to both of them, it being a fit season for saying it to both. Then as he had mentioned peace and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, but there is a peace and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> over bad actions also, he adds, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> Since he that ruins his brother, has at once subverted peace, and wronged <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, more grievously than he that plunders money. And what is worse is, that Another saved him, and you wrong and ruinest him. Since then eating, and the supposed perfect state, does not bring in these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtues</font></u></a>, but the things subversive of them it does bring in, how can it be else than right to make light of little things, in order to give firmness to great ones? Then since this rebuking took place in some degree out of vanity, he proceeds to say,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 18</font></u></a>. <q>For he that in these things serves Christ, is acceptable to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and approved of men.</q></p>
<p>For they will not admire you so much for your perfect state, as all will for peace and amity. For this is a goodly thing, that all will have the benefit of, but of that not one even will.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 19</font></u></a>. <q>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify one another.</q></p>
<p>This applies to the other, that he may grow peaceable. But the other to the latter too, that he may not destroy his brother. Still he has made both apply to either again, by saying, <q>one another,</q> and showing that without peace it is not easy to edify.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 20</font></u></a>. <q>For meat destroy not the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Giving this name to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of a brother, and adding greatly to the fears, and showing that he is doing the opposite of that he desires. For thou, he says, art so far from building up as you intend, that you dost even destroy, and that a building too not of man but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and not for any great end either, but for a trivial thing. For it was <q>for meat,</q> he says. Then lest so many indulgences should confirm the weaker brother in his misconception, he again becomes doctrinal, as follows,</p>
<p><q>All things indeed are pure, but it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> for that man who eats with offense.</q></p>
<p>Who does it, that is, with a bad <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. And so if you should force him, and he should eat, there would be nothing gained. For it is not the eating that makes unclean, but the intention with which a man eats. If then thou dost not set that aright, you have done all to no purpose, and hast made things worse: for thinking a thing unclean is not so bad as tasting it when one thinks it unclean. Here then you are committing two <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">errors</font></u></a>, one by increasing his prejudice through your quarrelsomeness, and another by getting him to taste of what is unclean. And so, as long as you do not persuade him, do not force him.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 21</font></u></a>. <q>It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</q></p>
<p>Again, he requires the greater alternative, that they should not only not force him, but even condescend to him. For he often did this himself also, as when he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:3</font></u></a></span>, when he was shorn <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act018.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 18:18</font></u></a></span>, when he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a> that Jewish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act021.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 21:26</font></u></a></span>. And he does not say to the man <q>do so,</q> but he states it in the form of a sentiment to prevent again making the other, the weaker man, too listless. And what are his words? <q>It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> not to eat flesh.</q> And why do I say flesh? If it be wine, or any other thing of the sort besides, which gives offense, refrain. For nothing is so important as your brother's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. And this Christ shows us, since He came from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and suffered all that He went through, for our sakes. And let me beg you to observe, how he also drives it home upon the other, by the words <q>stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</q> And do not tell me (he means) that he is so without reason but, that you have power to set it right. For the other has a sufficient claim to be helped in his weakness, and to you this were no loss, not being a case of hypocrisy <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal002.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"></a></span><u><font color="#0000ff">, but of edification and economy. For if you force him, he is at once destroyed, and will condemn you, and fortify himself the more in not eating. But if you condescend to him, then he will </font></u><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> you, and will not suspect you as a teacher, and you will afterwards gain the power of sowing imperceptibly in him the right views. But if he once <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> you, then you have closed the entrance for your reasoning. Do not then compel him, but even yourself refrain for his sake, not refraining from it as unclean, but because he is offended, and he will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> you the more. So <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also advises when he says, <q>It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> not to eat flesh,</q> not because it was unclean, but because the brother is offended and is weak.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 22</font></u></a>. <q>Have you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>? Have it to yourself.</q></p>
<p>Here he seems to me to be giving a gentle warning to the more advanced on the score of vanity. And what he says is this, Do you wish to show me that you are perfect, and fully furnished? Do not show it to me, but let your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> suffice. And by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, he here means that concerned not with doctrines, but with the subject in hand. For of the former it says, <q>With the mouth confession is made unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:10</font></u></a></span>; and, <q>Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk009.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 9:26</font></u></a></span> For the former by not being confessed, ruins us; and so does this by being confessed unseasonably. <q>Happy is he that condemns not himself in the thing which he allows.</q> Again he strikes at the weaker one, and gives him (i.e. the stronger) a sufficient crown, in that of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. Even if no man see, that is, you are able to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> in yourself. For after saying, <q>Have it to yourself,</q> to prevent his thinking this a contemptible tribunal, he tells him this is better to you than the world. And if all accuse you, and thou condemn not yourself, and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> lay no charge against you, you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>. But this is a statement he did not make to apply to any person whatever. For there are many that condemn not themselves, and yet are great transgressors: and these are the most miserable of men. But he still keeps to the subject in hand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 23</font></u></a>. <q>And he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubts</font></u></a> is condemned if he eat.</q></p>
<p>Again, it is to exhort him to spare the weaker, that he says this. For what good is it if he eat in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, and condemn himself? For I approve of him, who both eats, and does it not with doubting. See how he induces him not to eating only, but to eating with a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> too. Then he mentions likewise the reason why he is condemned continuing in these words,</p>
<p><q>Because he eats not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> Not because it is unclean, but because it is not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. For he did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that it is clean, but though unclean he touched it. But by this he shows them also what great harm they do by compelling men, and not persuading them, to touch things which had hitherto appeared unclean to them, that for this at all events they might leave rebuking. <q>For whatsoever is not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</q> For when a person does not feel sure, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that a thing is clean, how can he do else than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Now all these things have been spoken by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> of the subject in hand, not of everything. And observe what care he takes not to offend any; and he had said before, <q>If your brother be grieved with your meat, now you do not walk charitably.</q> But if one should not grieve him, much less ought one to give him offense. And again, <q>For meat destroy not the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> For if it were a grievous act of iniquity to throw down a Church, much more so is it to do so to the spiritual Temple. Since a man is more dignified than a Church: for it was not for walls that Christ died, but for these temples.</p>
<p>Let us then watch our own conduct on all sides, and afford to no one ever so little handle. For this life present is a race-course and we ought to have thousands of eyes <span>Hilary in Psalm 119</span> on every side, and not even to fancy that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> will be an adequate excuse. For there is such a thing, there certainly is, as being punished for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> is inexcusable. Since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> too were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, yet not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> in an excusable way. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, but they are without excuse. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:20</font></u></a></span> For when you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of those things which it is not possible to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, you will not be subject to any charge for it: but when of things easy and possible, you will be punished with the utmost rigor. Else if we be not excessively supine, but contribute our own share to its full amount, God will also reach forth His hand unto us in those things which we are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of. And this is what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said to the Philippians likewise. <q>If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:15</font></u></a></span> But when we are not willing to do even what we are masters of, we shall not have the benefit of His assistance in this either. And this was the case with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> too. <q>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>,</q> He says, <q>speak I unto them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a>, because seeing they see not.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:13</font></u></a></span> In what sense was it that seeing they saw not? They saw devils cast out, and they said, He has a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. They saw the dead raised, and they worshipped not, but attempted to kill Him. But not of this character was Cornelius. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:24</font></u></a></span> For this reason then, when he was doing the whole of his duty with sincerity, God added unto him that which was lacking also. Say not then, how came God to neglect such and such a one who was no formalist (<span>ἄ</span> <span>πλαστος</span>) and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man, though a Gentile? For in the first place no man can possibly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> for certain whether a person is no formalist, but He only who <q>formed (<span>πλάσαντι</span>) the hearts severally.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa033.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 33:15</font></u></a></span> And then there is this to be said too, that perchance (<span>πολλάκις</span>) such an one was neither thoughtful nor earnest. And how, it may be said, could he, as being very uninformed? (<span>ἄ</span> <span>πλαστος</span>.) Let me beg you to consider then this simple and single-hearted man, and take notice of him in the affairs of life, and you will see him a pattern of the utmost scrupulousness, such that if he would have shown it in spiritual matters he would not have been overlooked: for the facts of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> are clearer than the sun. And wherever a man may go, he might easily lay hold of his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, if he were minded, that is, to be heedful, and not to look on this as a by-work. For were the doings shut up into Palestine, or in a little corner of the world? Have you not heard the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> say, <q>All shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Me from the least even to the greatest?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer031.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 31:34</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb008.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 8:11</font></u></a></span> Do not you see the things themselves uttering the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>? How then are these to be excused, seeing as they do the doctrine of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> spread far and wide, and not troubling themselves, or caring to learn it? And do you require all this, it is asked, of a rude savage? Nay not of a rude savage only, but of any who is more savage than men of the present day. For why is it, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, that in matters of this world he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to answer when he is wronged, and to resist when he has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> done him, and do and devise everything to prevent his ever having his will thwarted even in the slightest degree; but in spiritual concerns he has not used this same judgment? And when a man worships a stone, and thinks it a god, he both keeps feasts to it, and spends money on it, and shows much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> towards it, and in no case becomes listless from his simpleness. But when he has to seek to the very and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, do you then mention singleness and simpleness to me? These things are not so, assuredly they are not! For the complaints are those of mere listlessness. For which do you think the most simple and rude, those in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> day or those now? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jos024.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Joshua 24:2</font></u></a></span> Clearly the former. And when that it was easiest to find religion out now or then? Clearly now. For now the Name of God is proclaimed even by all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, and the Prophets have preached, the things come to pass, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> been convinced. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen032.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 32:29</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jdg013.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judges 13:18</font></u></a></span> But at that day the majority were still in an uninstructed state, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> was dominant. And there was no law to instruct, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, nor doctrine, nor multitude of men acquainted with it, nor anything else of the kind, but all things then lay as it were in a deep darkness, and a night moonless and stormy. And yet even then that wondrous and noble man, though the obstacles were so great, still <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> God and practised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and led many to the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>; and this though he had not even the wisdom of those without. For how should he, when there were no letters even yet invented? Yet still he brought his own share in, and God joined to bring in what was lacking to him. For you cannot say even this, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> received his religion from his fathers, because he <span>Terah, see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jos024.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Joshua 24:2</font></u></a></span> was an idolater. But still, though he was from such forefathers and was uncivilized, and lived among uncivilized people, and had no instructor in religion, yet he attained to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and in comparison with all his descendants, who had the advantage both of the Law and the Prophets, he was so much more illustrious as no words can express. Why was it then? It was because in things of this world he did not give himself any great anxiety, but in things of the spirit he applied his whole attention. (In Gen. Hom. 33, etc.) And what of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10156b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Melchizedek</font></u></a>? Was not he also born about those times, and was so bright as to be called even a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> of God? (In Gen. Hom. 35, 36.) For it is impossible in the extreme, that the sober-minded (<span>νήφοντα</span>) should ever be overlooked. And let not these things be a trouble to us, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that it is the mind with which in each case the power lies, let us look to our own duties, that we may grow better. Let us not be demanding an account of God or enquire why He let such an one alone, but called such an one. For we are doing the same as if a servant that had given offense were to pry into his master's housekeeping. Wretched and miserable man, when you ought to be thoughtful about the account you have to give, and how you will reconcile your master, do you call him to account for things that you are not to give an account of, passing over those things of which you are to give a reckoning? What am I to say to the Gentile? He asks. Why, the same that I have been saying. And look not merely to what you shall say to the Gentile, but also to the means of amending yourself. When he is offended by examining into your life, then consider what you will say. For if he be offended, you will not be called to a reckoning for him, but if it be your way of life by which he is injured, you will have to undergo the greatest danger. When he sees you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophizing</font></u></a> about the kingdom, and fluttering at the things of this life, and at once afraid about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and trembling at the calamities of this life, then lay it to mind. When he sees this, and accuses you, and says, If you are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> with the Kingdom, how is it thou dost not look down upon the things of this life? If you are expecting the awful judgment, why do you not despise the terrors of this world? If you hope for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>, why do you not think scorn of death? When he says this, be thou anxious what defence you will make. When he sees you trembling at the thought of losing your money, you that expectest the heavens, and exceedingly glad about a single penny, and selling your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> again for a little money, then lay it to mind. For these are the things, just these, that make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> stumble. And so, if you are thoughtful about his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, make your defence on these heads, not by words, but by actions. For it is not through that question that anybody ever <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemed</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but through men's bad lives it is, that there are thousands of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemies</font></u></a> in all quarters. Set him right then. For the Gentile will next ask you, How am I to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that God's commands are feasible? For thou that art of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> extraction, and hast been brought up in this fine religion, dost not do anything of the kind. And what will you tell him? You will be sure to say, I will show you others that do; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10487b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">monks</font></u></a> that dwell in the deserts. And are you not ashamed to confess to being a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, and yet to send to others, as unable to show that you display the temper of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>? For he also will say directly, What need have I to go to the mountains, and to hunt up the deserts? For if there is no possibility for a person who is living in the midst of cities to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, this is a sad imputation on this rule of conduct, that we are to leave the cities, and run to the deserts. But show me a man who has a wife, and children, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>, and yet pursues wisdom. What are we then to say to all this? Must we not hang down our heads, and be ashamed? For Christ gave us no such commandment; but what? <q>Let your light shine before men</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:16</font></u></a></span>, not mountains, and deserts, and wildernesses, and out-of-the-way places. And this I say, not as abusing those who have taken up with the mountains, but as bewailing those that dwell in cities, because they have banished <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> from thence. Wherefore I beseech you let us introduce the discipline they have there here also, that the cities may become cities indeed. This will improve the Gentile. This will free him from countless offenses. And so if you would set him free from scandal, and yourself enjoy rewards without number, set your own life in order, and make it shine forth upon all sides, <q>that men may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q> For so we also shall enjoy that unutterable and great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant that we may all attain to, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man, etc.</p>

<p>It is always a custom with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> to conclude his exhortation with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and doxologies. For he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that the thing is one of no slight importance. And it is out of affectionateness and caution that he is in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of doing this. For it is the character of a teacher devoted to his children, and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, not to instruct them in words only, but by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> too to bring upon his teaching the assistance which is from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And this he does here also. But the connection is as follows: <q>To Him that is of power to establish you, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> for ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q> For he again clings to those weak brethren, and to them he directs his discourse. For when he was rebuking, he made all share his rebuke; but now, when he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a>, it is for these that he wears the attitude of a suppliant. And after saying, <q>to establish,</q> he proceeds to give the mode of it, <q>according to my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>;</q> and this was what one would do to show that as yet they were not firmly fixed, but stood, though with wavering. Then to give a trustworthiness to what he says, he proceeds, <q>and the preaching of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>;</q> that is, which He Himself preached. But if He preached it, the doctrines are not ours, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are of Him. And afterwards, in discussing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the preaching, He shows that this gift is one of much benefit, and of much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; and this he first proves from the person of the declarer thereof, and then likewise from the things declared. For it was glad tidings. Besides, from His not having made anything of them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to any before us. And this he intimates in the words, <q>according to the revelation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>.</q> And this is a sign of the greatest friendliness, to make us share in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, and no one before us. <q>Which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest.</q> For it had been determined long ago, but was only manifested now. How was it made manifest? <q>By the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> of the Prophets.</q> Here again he is releasing the weak person from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For what do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? Is it lest thou depart from the Law? This the Law wishes, this it foretold from of old. But if you pry into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of its being made manifest now, you are doing a thing not safe to do, in being curious about the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and calling Him to account. For we ought not with things of this nature to act as busybodies, but to be well pleased and content with them. Wherefore that he might himself put a check upon a spirit of this sort, he adds, <q>according to the commandment of the everlasting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> requires <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>, and not curiosity. And when God commands, one ought to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a>, not curious. Then he uses another argument to encourage them, saying <q>made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to all nations.</q> That is, it is not thou alone but the whole world that is of this Creed, as having had not man, but God for a Teacher. Wherefore also he adds, <q>through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> But it was not only made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>, but also confirmed. Now both are His work. And on this ground too the way it is to be read is, <q>Now to Him that is of power to establish you through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>;</q> and, as I was saying, he ascribes them both to Him; or rather, not both of these only, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> belonging (or ascribed, Gr. <span>τὴν εἰς</span>) to the Father also. And this too is why he said, <q>to Whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> forever, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q> And he uses a doxology again through awe at the incomprehensibleness of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>. For even now they have appeared, there is no such thing as comprehending them by reasonings, but it is by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> we must come to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of them, for in no other way can we. He well says, <q>To the only wise God.</q> For if you will only reflect how He brought the nations in, and blended them with those who in olden time had wrought well, how He saved those who were desperate, how He brought men not worthy of the earth up to heaven, and brought those who had fallen from the present life into that undying and unalterable life, and made those who were trampled down by devils to vie with Angels, and opened Paradise, and put a stop to all the old <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, and this too in a short time and by an easy and compendious way, then will you learn His wisdom—when you see that which neither Angels nor Archangels <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>, they of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> learned on a sudden through Jesus. (2 manuscripts add <q>then will you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His power.</q>) Right then is it to admire His wisdom, and to give Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>! But you keep dwelling over little things, still sitting under the shadow. And this is not much like one that gives <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. For he who has no confidence in Him, and no trust in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, does not bear testimony to the grandeur of His doings. But he himself offers <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> up in their behalf, in order to bring them also to the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>. But when you hear him say, <q>to the only wise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> think not that this is said in disparagement of the Son. For if all these things whereby His wisdom is made apparent were done <span>or made, see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 1:3</font></u></a></span> by Christ, and without Him no single one, it is quite plain that he is equal in wisdom also. What then is the reason of his saying <q>only?</q> To set Him in contrast with every created being. After giving the doxology then, he again goes from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> to exhortation, directing his discourse against the stronger, and saying as follows:</p></div>

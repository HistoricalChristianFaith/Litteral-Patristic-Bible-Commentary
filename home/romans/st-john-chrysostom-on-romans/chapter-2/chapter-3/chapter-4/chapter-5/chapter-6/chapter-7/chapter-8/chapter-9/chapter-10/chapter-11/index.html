<p>And he introduces the form a person would use in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, as though taking occasion from what had been said, and after making this alarming statement, by the denial of it he causes the sequel to be allowed with readiness; and what by all the former arguments he had been laboring to show that he makes good here also. What then is this? That even if there be but a few saved, the promise yet stands good. This is why he does not merely say <q>people,</q> but <q>people which He foreknew.</q> Then proceeding with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that the <q>people</q> were not cast off, <q>For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, of the tribe of Benjamin.</q></p>
<p>I, he says, the instructor, the preacher. Now since this seemed contrary to what was said before in the words, <q>Who has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> our report?</q> and, <q>All the day long have I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;</q> and, <q>I will provoke you to jealousy by them which are no people;</q> he was not satisfied with the deprecation, nor with having said, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> forbid,</q> but makes it good by taking it up again and saying, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has not cast away His people.</q> But this is not a confirmation, men may say, but an assertion. Observe then the confirmation, both the first, and that which follows it. For the first is that he was himself of that race. But He would not, if on the point of casting them off, have chosen from them him to whom He entrusted all the preaching, and the affairs of the world, and all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, and the whole economy. This then is one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>, but the next, after it, is his saying, that <q>people whom He foreknew,</q> that is, who He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> clearly were suited to it, and would receive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. <span>Pococke on Hos. p. 23.

And so to prevent any from saying, Are you the people, then? And because you have been called, has the nation been called? He proceeds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2</font></u></a>. <q>He has not cast off His people, whom He foreknew.</q></p>
<p>As though he said, I have with me three, five, or ten thousand. What then? Has the people come to be three, five, or ten thousand? That seed that compared with the stars of heaven for multitude, or the sand of the sea? Is this the way you deceive us and put a cheat upon us, by making the whole people yourself and the few that are with you; and did you inflate us with idle hopes, and say that the promise has been fulfilled, when all are lost, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> comes down to a few? This is all bombast and vanity! We cannot away with such sophistry as this! Now, that they may not say this, see how in the sequel he proceeds to the answer, not giving the objection indeed, but before it grounding the answer to it upon ancient history. What then is the answer?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2-5</font></u></a>. <q>Do you not know,</q> he says, <q>what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says of Elias? How he (so most; manuscripts Sav. who) makes intercession to God against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, saying, Lord, they have killed Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and dug down Your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what says the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02175a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Baal</font></u></a>. Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What he means is nearly this. <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has not cast off His people.</q> For had He done so, He would have admitted none of them. But if He did admit some, He has not cast them off. Still it is said, if He had not cast off, He would have admitted all. This does not follow; since in Elijah's time the part to be saved had come down to <q>seven thousand:</q> and now also there are probably many that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. But if you do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> who they are, this is no wonder, for that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, who was so great and good a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. But God ordered things for Himself when even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> them not. But consider his judgment. Now in proving what was before him, he covertly augments the charge against them. For this is why he gave the whole passage, that he might parade before them their untowardness, and show that they had been so from of old. For if he had not wished this, but had directed his whole attention to prove that the people lay in the few, he would have said that even in Elijah's time, seven thousand were left. But now he reads to them the passage further back, as having been throughout at pains to show that it was no strange thing that they did with Christ, and the Apostles, but their habitual practice. For to prevent their saying that it was as a deceiver we put Christ to death, and as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a> that we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecute</font></u></a> the Apostles, he brings forward the text which says, <q>Lord, they have killed Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and dug down your altars.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki019.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 19:14</font></u></a></span> Then in order not to make his discourse galling to them, he attaches another reason to the bringing forward of the text. For he quotes it not as if it was on purpose to accuse them, but as if intent upon showing some other things. And he leaves them without any excuse even by what had before been done. For observe how strong the accusation is even from the person speaking. For it is neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, nor Peter, nor James, nor John, but one whom they held in the greatest estimation, the chief of the Prophets, the friend of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, a man who had been so very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a> in their behalf as even to be given up to hunger for them, who even to this day has never died. What then does this man say? <q>Lord, they have killed Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and dug down Your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</q> What could be more brutal cruelty than this? For when they should have besought pardon for the offenses they had already committed, they were minded even to kill him. And all these things put them quite beyond pardon. For it was not during the prevalence of the famine, but when the season was favorable, and their shame was done away, and the devils (i.e. false gods) had been put to shame, and the power of God had been shown, and the king had bowed beneath it, that they committed these audacities, passing from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, and making away with their teachers, and such as would bring them to a better mind. What then could they have to say to this? Were they too deceivers? Were they too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>? Did they not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> whence they were either? But they distressed you. Yes, but they also told you goodly things. But what of the altars? The altars too did not surely distress you? Did they too exasperate you? See of what obstinacy, of what insolence they were ever yielding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a>! This is why in another passage too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, when writing to the Thessalonians, You also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, who both killed the Lord, and their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> us, and please not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and are contrary to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th002.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 2:14-15</font></u></a></span>; which is what he says here too, that they both dug down the altars, and killed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>. But what says the answer of God unto him? <q>I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02175a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Baal</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki019.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 19:18</font></u></a></span> And what has this to do with the present subject? Some may say. It has a great deal to do with the present subject. For he shows here that it is the worthy that God uses to save even if the promise be made to the whole nation. And this he pointed out above when he said, <q>Though the number of the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.</q> And, <q>Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should have become as Sodoma.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom009.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 9:27-29</font></u></a></span> And he points it out from this passage also. Wherefore he proceeds to say, <q>Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>.</q> Observe that each word maintains its own rank, showing at once God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a> temper of them that receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. For by saying election, he showed the approval of them, but by saying <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, he showed the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 6</font></u></a>. <q>And if by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, then it is no more of works, otherwise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is no more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>: but if it be of works, then is it no more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, otherwise work is no more work.</q></p>
<p>He again springs upon the disputatiousness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, in what has just been quoted; and on this ground bereaves them of excuse. For you cannot, he means, so much as say, that the Prophets called indeed, and God invited, and the state of things cried aloud, and the provoking to jealousy was enough to draw us to Him, but what was enjoined was grievous, and this is why we could not draw near, since we had a display of works demanded of us, and laborious well-doings. For you cannot even say this. For how should God have demanded this of you, when this would just throw His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> into the shade? And this he said out of a wish to show that He was most desirous that they might be saved. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu005.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 5:29</font></u></a></span> For not only would their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> be easily brought about, but it was also God's greatest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to display His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man. Why then are you afraid of drawing near, since you have no works demanded of you? Why are you bickering and quarrelsome, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is before you, and why keep putting me the Law forward to no purpose whatsoever? For you will not be saved by that, and will mar this gift also; since if you pertinaciously insist on being saved by it, you do away with this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Then that they might not think this strange, having first taken those seven thousand; he said that they were saved by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. For when he says, <q>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>;</q> he shows that they also were saved by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. And not hereby only, but likewise by saying, <q>I have reserved unto Myself.</q> For this is the language of One Who shows that He Himself was the chief Contributor. And if by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, it will be said, how came we all not to be saved? Because ye would not. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, though it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, saves the willing, not those who will not have it, and turn away from it, who persist in fighting against it, and opposing themselves to it. Observe how throughout the point he is proving is, <q>Not as though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Word of God</font></u></a> had taken none effect,</q> by showing that the worthy were those to whom the promise came, and that these, few though they be, may yet be the people of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and indeed he had stated it in the beginning of the Epistle with much force, where he says, <q>For what if some did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 3:3</font></u></a></span>, and did not even stop at this, but proceeded, <q>Yea, let God be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, and every man a liar.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 3:4</font></u></a></span> And here again he confirms it another way, and shows the force of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, and that always the one were being saved, the other perished. Let us then give thanks, that we belong to them that are being saved, and not having been able to save ourselves by works, were saved by the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. But in giving thanks, let us not do this in words only, but in works and actions. For this is the genuine thanksgiving, when we do those things whereby God is sure to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, and flee from those from which we have been set free. For if we, after insulting the King, instead of being punished have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, and then go and insult Him afresh, since we are detected in the utmost ingratitude, we should with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> have to suffer the utmost punishment, one greater far than the former. For the former insolence did not show us so ungrateful as that committed after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and much attention shown us. Let us then flee those things from which we have been set free, and not give thanks with our mouths only, lest it be said of us also, <q>This people <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> Me with their lips, but with their heart is far from Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa029.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 29:13</font></u></a></span> For how is it else than unseemly, when the <q>heavens declare the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa018.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 19:1</font></u></a></span>, and thou, for whom the heavens were made that glorify Him, doest such things that through you the God that made you is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemed</font></u></a>? It is for this that not only he that blasphemes, but yourself also, will be liable to punishment. For the heavens also do not glorify God by sending forth a voice but by putting others upon doing it at the sight of them, and yet they are said <q>to declare the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> Thus too they that furnish a life to be wondered at, even though they hold their peace, yet glorify <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when others through them glorify Him. For He is not so much reverenced because of the heaven, as of a spotless life. When then we are discoursing with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, we cite (4 manuscripts read or point to the reading, <q>let us not cite</q>) not the heavens before them, but the men, whom though they were in worse plight than brutes, He has persuaded to be the Angels' competitors. And we (1 manuscripts <q>let us</q>) stop their mouths by speaking of this change. For far better than the heaven is man, and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> brighter than their beauty may he possess. For it, though visible for so long a time, did not persuade much. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, after preaching a short time, drew the whole world unto him. <span>St. Augustine on Psalm 19:4</span> For he possessed a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> no less than the heaven, which was able to draw all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> unto him. Our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is not a match even for the earth: but his is equal to the heavens. That stands indeed keeping to its own boundary and rule; but the loftiness of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> transcended all the heavens, and conversed with Christ Himself. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co010.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 10:15</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom015.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 15:19</font></u></a>, etc.</span> And the beauty of it was so great, that even God heralds it forth. For the stars did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> marvel at when they were made. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job038.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 38:7</font></u></a></span> But this He marvelled at when He says, <q>He is a chosen vessel unto Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:15</font></u></a></span> And this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> does a cloud many times overshadow. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a> overshadowed but even in storms he was clearer to the sight than the hard sky (<span>σταθερἅς</span> <span>μεσημβρίας</span> <span>)</span> at noon, and shone constantly as it had done before the clouds came on. For the Sun who shone in him sent not forth such rays as to be over-clouded by the concourse of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, but even then shone forth the more. Wherefore he says, <q>My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is sufficient for you, for My Strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co012.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 12:9</font></u></a></span> Let us then strive to be like him, and then even to what we are this heaven will be as nothing, if we wish it, nor yet the sun, nor the whole world. For these are for us, and not we for them. Let us show that we are worthy of having had these made for us. For if we be found unworthy of these, how shall we be worthy a kingdom? For indeed all that live so as to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> God are unworthy to see the sun. They who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> Him are unworthy to enjoy the creatures who glorify Him: since even a son who insults his father is unworthy to be waited upon by the approved servants. Hence these will enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and that great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; but we shall have to undergo punishment and vengeance.</p>
<p>How miserable then will it be for the creation which was made for you to be fashioned <q>according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> liberty of the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:21</font></u></a></span> but for us who were made children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, through our much listlessness, to be sent away to destruction and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, for whose sake the creation shall enjoy that great festal time? Now to keep this from coming to pass, let such of us as have a pure <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> keep it still such, or rather let us make its brightness more intense. And let those of us that have a soiled one, not despair. For <q>if</q> (he says) <q>your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> be as purple, I will make them white as snow. And if they be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:18</font></u></a></span> But when it is God that promises, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> not, but do those things whereby you may draw to you these promises. Are they unnumbered, the fearful and outrageous acts done by you? And what of this? For hitherto you are not gone away into the grave where no man shall confess. (ib. 38:18; Psalm 6:5.) Hitherto the arena (<span>θέατρον</span>) is not broken up for you, but you are standing within the line, and you are able even by a struggle at the last to recover all your defeats. You are not yet come to where the rich man was, for you to hear it said, <q>there is a gulf between you and us.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk016.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 16:26</font></u></a></span> The Bridegroom is not yet at hand, that one should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> to give you of his oil. Still can you buy and store up. And there is not one yet to say, <q>Not so; lest there be not enough for us and and you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:9</font></u></a></span>; but there are many that sell, the naked, the hungry, the sick, the imprisoned. Give food to these, clothing to those, visit the sick, and the oil will come more than from fountains. The day of account is not here. Use the time as need be, and make deductions from the debts, and to him that owes <q>an hundred measures of oil, say, Take your bill and write fifty.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk016.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 16:6</font></u></a></span> And with money, and with words, and with every other thing do in like manner, imitating that steward. And advise this to yourself, and also to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">relatives</font></u></a>, for you have still the power of saying so. You are not yet come to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of calling in another in their behalf, but you have power to give advice at once to yourself and to others. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk016.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 16:28</font></u></a></span> But when you are gone away there, neither of these things will you have it in your power to do at need. And with good reason. For thou who hast had so long a period fixed you, and neither done yourself good, nor any else, how when you are under the Judge's hands shall you be able to obtain this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>? Putting all these things together then, let us cling fast to our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and not lose the opportunity of this life present. For it is possible, it is, even at our last breath to please God. It is possible to gain approval by your last will, not indeed in such way as in our lifetime, still it is possible. How, and in what way? If you leave Him among your heirs, and givest Him also (<span>καὶ αὐτᾥ</span>) a portion of your whole estate. Have you not fed Him in your lifetime? At all events when departed, when you are no longer owner, give Him a share of your goods. He is loving unto man, He does not deal niggardly by you. It is a mark to be sure of a greater desire, and so it will be more rewarded, to feed Him in your lifetime. But if you have not done this, at all events do the next best thing. Leave Him joint-heir (see p. 384) with your children, and if you are dilatory over this, bethink yourself that His Father made you joint-heir with Him, and break down your inhuman spirit. For what excuse will you have if you dost not even make Him a sharer with your children, who made you share the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and was slain for you? And yet all that ever He did, He did not in repayment of a debt, but as bestowing a favor. But you after so great benefits, have been made a debtor as well. And yet, though things are so, it is as if receiving a favor, not as demanding payment of a debt, that He crowns you; and this too when what He is to receive is His own. Give then your money, which is now no longer of any use to you, and of which you are no longer owner; and He will give you a Kingdom which shall be of service to you perpetually, and with it will bestow also the things of this life. For if He be made the joint heir of your children, He does lighten their orphanage for them, do away with plots against them, beat off insults, stop the mouths of pettifoggers. And if they themselves be unable to stand up for their bequeathments, He will Himself stand up, and not let them be broken through. But if He do even allow this, then He makes up of Himself all that was ordered in the will with still greater liberality, because He has been but mentioned in it. Leave Him then your heir. For it is to Him that you are upon the point of going. He will be your Judge Himself in the trial for all that has been done here. But there are some so miserable and pinched, that though they have no children, still they have not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> to do this, but approve of giving that they have to hangers on, and to flatterers, and to this person and to that, sooner than to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, Who has done them so great benefits. And what can be more unreasonable than this conduct? For if one were to compare men of this cast to asses, aye, or to stones, one shall not still be saying anything tantamount to their unreasonableness and senselessness. Nor could one find a similitude to put before you their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and dementedness. For what pardon shall they obtain for not having fed Him in their lifetime, who, even when they are on the point of departing to Him, have not the inclination to give Him but a trifle out of those goods, of which they are no longer the owners, but are of such an inimical and hostile disposition, as not even to give Him a share in what is useless to themselves? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how many of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> have not even been counted worthy to obtain an end of this kind, but have been snatched off suddenly? But you does God empower to give orders to your kindred, and to speak with them about your property, and set all that is in your house in order. What defence then will you have to set up, when even after receiving this favor from Him, you have treacherously given up the benefit, and art standing as it were in diametrical opposition to your forefathers in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>? For they even in their lifetime sold all, and brought it to the Apostle's feet. But you, even at your death, dost not give any share to them that need. What is the better part, and gives one much boldness, is to remedy poverty in one's lifetime. But if you have not been minded to do this, at all events do upon your death-bed some noble act. For this is not what a strong <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> for Christ would do, yet still it is an act of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. For if you will not have the high place with the Lambs, still even to be after them at all is no light thing, and so not to be placed with the goats nor on the left hand. But if you will not do even this, what plea is to rescue you, when neither the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of death nor your money having become henceforth of no use to you, nor the leaving of safety behind you to your children, nor the laying up of much pardon there against the time to come, will make you merciful to man? Wherefore I advise, as the best thing, that in your lifetime you give the larger half of your goods to the poor. But if there be any of so narrow a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as not to have the heart to do so, at all events let them by necessity become merciful. For when you were living as if there were no death, then you clung close to your goods. But now since you have learned that you are to die, at least now give over your opinion, and deliberate about your affairs as one that must die. Or rather as one that ought to enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> life for evermore. For if what I am going to say be distasteful, and big with horror, still it must be said. Reckon with your slaves the Lord. Are you giving your slaves liberty? Give Christ liberty from famine, from distress, from imprisonment, from nakedness. Are you horrified at the words? Is it not then more horrible when thou dost not even thus much? And here the word makes your blood curdle. But when you are gone to that world, and hast to hear things far more grievous than these, and see the tortures which are incurable, what will you say? To whom will you flee for refuge? Whom will you call to your alliance and assistance? Will it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>? He will not hearken to you. Or those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>? They will not give you of their oil. Your father then or your grandfather? But none even of these, if he be ever so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, will have it in his power to reverse that sentence. Weighing then all these things, to Him Who alone is Lord to blot out the bill against you and to quench that flame, to Him make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> and supplication, and propitiate Him, by now feeding Him and clothing Him continually: that in this world you may depart with a good hope, and when you are there you may enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> blessings, which may we all attain to by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rom. XI. 7</font></u></a></p>
<p><q><em>What then?</em> <em><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> has not obtained that, which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it and the rest were blinded.</em></q></p>
<p>He had said that God did not cast off His people; and to show in what sense He had not cast them off, he takes refuge in the Prophets again. And having shown by them that the more part of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were lost, that he might not seem to be again bringing forward an accusation of his own, and to make his discourse offensive, and to be attacking them as enemies, he takes refuge in David and Isaiah, and says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 8</font></u></a>. <q>According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa029.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 29:10</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Or rather we should go back to the beginning of his argument. Having then mentioned the state of things in Elijah's time, and shown what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is, he proceeds, <q>What then? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> has not obtained that which he seeks for.</q> Now this is as much what an accuser would say, as what one who was putting a question. For the Jew, he means, is inconsistent with himself when he seeks for righteousness, which he will not accept. Then to leave them with no excuse, he shows, from those who have accepted it, their unfeeling spirit, as he says, <q>But the election has obtained it,</q> and they are the condemnation of the others. And this is what Christ says, <q>But if I by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02388c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Beelzebub</font></u></a> cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Wherefore they shall be your judges.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk011.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 11:19</font></u></a></span> For to prevent any one from accusing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the thing, and not their own temper, he points out those who had obtained it. Hence he uses the word with great propriety, to show at once the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> from above and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> of these. For it is not to deny <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free-will</font></u></a> that he speaks of their having <q>obtained</q> (as by chance, Gr. <span>ἐ</span> <span>πέτυχε</span>) it, but to show the greatness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, and that the greater part was of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, though not the whole. For we too are in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of saying, <q>so and so chanced to get</q> (same word), <q>so and so met with,</q> when the gain has been a great one. Because it is not by man's labors, but by God's gift, that the greater part was brought about.</p>
<p><q>And the rest was blinded.</q></p>
<p>See how he has been bold enough to tell with his own voice the casting off of the rest. For he had indeed spoken of it already, but it was by bringing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> in as accusers. But from this point he declares it in his own person. Still even here he is not content with his own declaration, but brings Isaiah the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> in again. For after saying, <q>were blinded,</q> he proceeds; <q>according as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber.</q> Now whence came this blinding? He had indeed mentioned the causes of it before, and turned it all upon their own heads, to show that it was from their unseasonable obstinacy that they had to bear this. And now he speaks of it too. For when he says, <q>Eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear,</q> he is but finding fault with their contentious spirit. For when they had <q>eyes to see</q> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, and were possessed of <q>ears to hear</q> that marvellous Teaching, they never used these as were fitting. And the <q>He gave,</q> do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> to mean here an agency, but a permission only. But <q>slumber</q> (<span>καταάνυξις</span> lit. piercing) is a name he here gives to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> inclinable to the worse, when incurably and unchangeably so. For in another passage David says, <q>that my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> may sing unto You, and I may not be put to slumber</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa029.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 30:12</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13722a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Septuagint</font></u></a></span>: that is, I may not alter, may not be changed. For as a man who is hushed to slumber in a state of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pious</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> would not easily be made to change his side; so too he that is slumbering in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> would not change with facility. For to be hushed to slumber here is nothing else but to be fixed and riveted to a thing. In pointing then to the incurable and unchangeable character of their spirit, he calls it <q>a spirit of slumber.</q> Then to show that for this unbelief they will be most severely punished, he brings the Prophet forward again, threatening the very things which in the event came to pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 9</font></u></a>. <q>Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa069.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 69:22-23</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>That is, let their comforts and all their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things change and perish, and let them be open to attack from any one. And to show that this is in punishment for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> that they suffer this, he adds, <q>and a recompense unto them.</q></p>

<p>Do these things then still require any interpreting? Are they not plain even to those ever so senseless? And before our words, the very issue of facts has anticipated us in bearing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> to what was said. For at what time have they ever been so open to attacks? At what time such an easy prey? At what time has He so <q>bowed down their backs?</q> At what time have they been set under such bondage? And what is more, there is not to be any unloosing from these terrors. And this the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> has also hinted. For he does not say only, <q>bow Thou down their back,</q> but, <q>forever bow Thou down.</q> But if you are disposed to dispute, O Jew, about the issue, from what has gone before learn also the present case. Thou went down to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>; and two hundred years passed, and God freed you speedily from that bondage, and that though thou were irreligious, and went whoring with the most baneful whoredom. You were freed from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and you worshipped the calf, you sacrificed your sons to Baalpeor, you defiled the temple, you went after every sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>, you grew not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> nature itself. The mountains, the groves, the hills, the springs, the rivers, the gardens did you fill with accursed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a>, you slew the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, overthrew the altars, exhibited every excess of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> and irreligion. Still, after giving you up for seventy years to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Babylonians</font></u></a>, He brought you back again to your former freedom, and gave you back the temple, and your country, and your old form of polity and there were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> again, and the gift of the Spirit. Or rather, even in the season of your captivity you were not deserted, but even there were Daniel, and Ezekiel, and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> Jeremiah, and in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04749a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">desert</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. After this you reverted to your former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> again, and wast a reveller <span>ἐ</span> <span>ξεβακχεύθης</span> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ma014.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Maccabees 14:33</font></u></a></span>, therein, and changed your manner of life <span>πολιτείαν</span> to the Grecian in the time of Antiochus the impious <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan008.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 8:14</font></u></a>; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ma004.htm#verse54" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Maccabees 4:54</font></u></a></span>. But even then for a three years and a little over only were ye given up to Antiochus, and then by the Maccabees ye raised those bright trophies again. But now there is nothing of the sort, for the reverse has happened throughout. And this is ground for the greatest surprise, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vices</font></u></a> have ceased, and the punishment has been increased, and is without any hope of a change. For it is not seventy years only that have passed away, nor a hundred, nor yet twice as many but three hundred, and a good deal over, and there is no finding even a shadow of a hope of the kind. And this though ye neither are idolaters, nor do the other audacious acts ye did before. What then is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>? The reality has succeeded to the type, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> has shut out the Law. And this the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> foretelling from of old said, <q>And ever bow Thou down their back.</q> See the minuteness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, how it foretells their unbelief, and also points out their disputatiousness, and shows the judgment which should follow, and sets forth the endlessness of the punishment. For as many of the duller sort, through unbelief in what was to come to pass, wished to see things to come by the light of things present, from this point of time God gave <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of His power on either part, by lifting those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, above the heaven, but bringing down such of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> not to the lowest estate of desolation, and giving them up to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> not to be ended. Having then urged them severely both about their not believing, and about what they had suffered and were yet to suffer, he again allays what he had said by writing as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 11</font></u></a>. <q>I say then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid.</q></p>
<p>When he has shown that they were liable to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> without number, then he devises an allayment. And consider the judgment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. The accusation he had introduced from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, but the allayment he makes come from himself. For that they had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a> greatly, he would say, none will gainsay. But let us see if the fall is of such kind as to be incurable, and quite preclude their being set up again. But of such kind it is not. You see how he is attacking them again, and under the expectation of some allayment he proves them guilty of confessed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. But let us see what even by way of allayment he does devise for them. Now what is the allayment? <q>When the fullness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>shall have come in, then shall all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> be saved,</q> at the time of his second coming, and the end of the world. Yet this he does not say at once. But since he had made a hard onset upon them, and linked accusations to accusations, bringing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> in after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> crying aloud against them, Isaiah, Elijah, David, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, Hosea, not once or twice, but several times; lest in this way he should both by driving these into despair, make a wall to bar their access to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and should further make such of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> unreasonably elated, and they also by being puffed up should take harm in matter of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, he further solaces them by saying, <q>But rather through their fall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> has come unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> But we must not take what is here said literally, but get acquainted with the spirit and object of the speaker, and what he aimed to compass. Which thing I ever entreat of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. For if with this in our minds we take up what is here said, we shall not find a difficulty in any part of it. For his present anxiety is to remove from those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> the haughtiness which might spring in them from what he had said. For in this way they too were more likely to continue unshaken in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, when they had learned to be reasonable, as also those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were, when quit of despair, more likely to come with readiness to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. Having regard then to this object of his, let us so listen to all that is said on this passage. What does he say then? And whence does he show that their fall was not irremediable, nor their rejection final? He argues from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, saying as follows:</p>
<p><q>Through their fall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> has come unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, for to provoke them to jealousy.</q></p>
<p>This language is not his own only, but in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a> too the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parables</font></u></a> mean this. For He who made a marriage feast for His Son, when the guests would not come, called those in the highways. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:9</font></u></a></span>. And He who planted the Vineyard, when the husbandmen slew the Heir, let out His Vineyard to others. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat021.htm#verse38" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 21:38</font></u></a>, etc</span> And without any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>, He Himself said, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat015.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 15:24</font></u></a></span> And to the Syrophœnician <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, when she persevered, He said somewhat further besides. <q>It is not meet,</q> He says, <q>to take the children's bread, and cast it to the dogs.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat015.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 15:26</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> to those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> that raised a sedition, <q>It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken unto you: but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:46</font></u></a></span> And throughout it is clear that the natural course of things was this, that they should be the first to come in, and then those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>; but since they disbelieved, the order was reversed; and their unbelief and fall caused these to be brought in first. Hence it is that he says, <q>through their fall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> has come to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, for to provoke them to jealousy.</q> But if he mentions what the course of things issued in, as if the chief design of Providence, do not feel surprised. For he wishes to solace their down-stricken <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, and his meaning is about this. Jesus came to them; they did not receive Him, though He did countless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, but crucified Him. Hence He drew the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> to Him, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> they had, by cutting them to the heart for their insensibility might at least out of a moroseness against others persuade them to come over. For they ought to have been first admitted, and then we. And this was why he said, <q>For it is the power of God unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> unto every one that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believes</font></u></a>; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:16</font></u></a></span> But as they had started off, we the last became first. See then how great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> he gathers for them even from this. One that he says, we were then called, when they were not willing; a second that he says, the reason of our being called was not that we only might be saved, but that they also, growing jealous at our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, might become better. What does he say then? That if it were not for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews'</font></u></a> sake, we should not have been called and saved at all? We should not before them, but in the regular order. Wherefore also when He was speaking to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, He did not say barely, <q>Go to the lost sheep of the House of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:6</font></u></a></span>, but, <q>Go rather to the sheep,</q> to show that to those parts also they must come after these. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> again says not, <q>It was necessary that the word of God should have been spoken unto you,</q> but <q>should first have been spoken unto you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:46</font></u></a></span>, to show that in the second place it must be to us also. And this was both done and said, that they might not be able, shameless though they were, to pretend that they were overlooked, and that was why they did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. This then was why Christ, though he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> all things before, yet came to them first.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 12</font></u></a>. <q>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, how much more their fullness?</q></p>
<p>Here he is speaking to gratify them. For even if these had fallen a thousand times, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> would not have been saved unless they had shown <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. As the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> likewise would not have perished unless they had been unbelieving and disputatious. But as I said, he is solacing them now they are laid low, giving them so much the more ground to be confident of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> if they altered. For if when they stumbled, he says, so many enjoyed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and when they were cast out so many were called, just consider what will be the case when they return. But he does not put it thus, When they return. Now he does not say <q>how much more their</q> return, or their altering, or their well-doing, but <q>how much more their fullness,</q> that is, when they are all about coming in. And this he said to show that then also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and God's gift will do the larger part, or almost the whole.</p>
<p>Ver. 13, 14. <q>For I speak to you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>; inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, I magnify mine office; if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</q></p>
<p>Again he endeavors much to get himself clear of untoward suspicion. And he seems to be blaming the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, and to be humbling their conceits, yet he gives a gentle provocation to the Jew also. And indeed he goes round about seeking to veil and allay this great ruin of theirs. But he finds no means of doing it, owing to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the facts. For from what he had said, they deserved but the greater condemnation, when those who were far short of them had taken the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things prepared for them. This is why then he passes from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> to those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, and puts in between his discourse the part about them, as wishing to show that he is saying all these things in order to instruct them to be reasonable. For I praise you, he means, for these two reasons; one, because I am necessitated to do so as being your commissioned minister; the other, that through you I may save others. And he does not say, my brethren, my kinsmen; but, <q>my flesh.</q> And next, when pointing out their disputatious spirit, he does not say, <q>if by any means I may</q> persuade, but, <q>provoke to jealousy and save;</q> and here again not all, but, <q>some of them.</q> So hard were they! And even amid his rebuke he shows again the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, for they are causes of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and not in the same way. For they became purveyors of blessings to them through unbelief, but these to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Hence the estate of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> seems to be at once equal and superior. For what will you say, O Jew? That if we had not been cast out, he would not have been called so soon? This the man of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> may say too, If I had not been saved, you would not have been moved to jealousy. But if you would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> wherein we have the advantage, I save you by believing, but it is by stumbling that you have afforded us an access before yourself. Then perceiving again that he had touched them to the quick, resuming his former argument, he says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 15</font></u></a>. <q>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?</q></p>
<p>Yet this again condemns them, since, while others gained by their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, they did not profit by other men's well doings. But if he asserts that to be their doing which necessarily happened, be not surprised: since (as I have said several times) it is to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> these, and to exhort the other, that he throws his address into this form. For as I said before, if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> had been cast away a thousand times over, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> had not shown <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, they would never have been saved. But he stands by the feeble party, and gives assistance to the distressed one. But see also even in his favors to them, how he solaces them in words only. <q>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,</q> (and what is this to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>?) <q>what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?</q> Yet even this was no boon to them, unless they had been received. But what he means is to this effect. If in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> with them He gave other men so great gifts, when He is reconciled to them what will He not give? But as the resurrection of the dead was not by the receiving of them, so neither now is our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> through them. But they were cast out owing to their own folly, but it is by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> that we are saved, and by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> from above. But of all this nothing can be of service to them, unless they show the requisite <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Yet doing as he is wont, he goes on to another encomium, which is not really one, but which only seems to be, so imitating the wisest physicians, who give their patients as much consolation as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the sickness allows them. And what is it that he says?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 16</font></u></a>. <q>For if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, the lump also is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>; and if the root be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, so are the branches;</q></p>
<p>So calling in this passage by the names of the first-fruit and root <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, the patriarchs, all who were of note in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>; and the branches, those from them who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. Then since the fact met him that many had disbelieved, observe how he undermines (<span>ὑ</span> <span>ποτέμνεται</span>, see p. 345) it again, and says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 17</font></u></a>. <q>And if some of the branches be broken off.</q></p>
<p>And yet above you said that the more part perished, and a few were saved only. How came it then that speaking of those that perished, you have used a <q>some,</q> which is indicative of fewness? It is not, he replies, in opposition to myself, but out of a desire to court and recover those that are distressed. Observe how in the whole of the passage one finds him working at this object, the wish to solace them. And if you deny it, many contradictions will follow. But let me beg you to notice his wisdom, how while he seems to be speaking for them, and devising a solace for them, he aims a secret blow at them, and shows that they are devoid of all excuse, even from the <q>root,</q> from the <q>first-fruit.</q> For consider the badness of the branches, which, when they have a sweet root, still do not imitate it; and the faultiness of the lump, when it is not altered even by the first-fruit. <q>And if some of the branches were broken off.</q> However, the greater part were broken off. Yet, as I said, he wishes to comfort them. And this is why it is not in his own person, but in theirs, that he brings in the words used, and even in this gives a secret stroke at them, and shows them to have fallen from being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> kinsmen. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:9</font></u></a></span> For what he was desirous of saying was, that they had nothing in common with them. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh008.htm#verse39" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 8:39</font></u></a></span> For if the root be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, and these be not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, then these are far away from the root. Then under the appearance of solacing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, he again by his accusation smites them of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. For after saying, <q>And if some of the branches were broken off,</q> he proceeds.</p>
<p><q>And thou being a wild olive were grafted in.</q></p>
<p>For the less esteem the man of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> is of, the more the Jew is vexed at seeing him enjoy his goods. And to the other, the disgrace of the little esteem he was of, is nothing to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of the change. And consider his skilfulness. He does not say, <q>thou were</q> planted <q>in,</q> but <q>thou were grafted in,</q> by this again cutting the Jew to the heart, as showing that the Gentile man was standing in his own tree, and himself lying on the ground. Wherefore he does not stop even here, nor after he had spoken of grafting in does he leave off (and yet in this he declared the whole matter), but still he dwells over the prosperous state of the Gentile, and enlarges upon his fair fame in the words, <q>And with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree.</q> And he seems indeed to have viewed him in the light of an addition. But he shows that he was no whit the worse on that account, but in possession of everything, that the branch which had come up out of the root had. Lest then on hearing the words, <q>and thou were grafted in,</q> you should suppose him to be lacking when compared with the natural branch, see how he makes him equal to it by saying, that <q>with them you partake of the root and fatness of the olive:</q> that is, hast been put into the same noble rank, the same nature. Then in rebuking him, and saying,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 18</font></u></a>. <q>Boast not against the branches.</q> He seems indeed to be comforting the Jew, but points out his vileness and extreme dishonor. And this is why he says not, <q>boast not,</q> but, <q>boast not against</q> do not boast against them so as to sunder them. For it is into their place that you have been set, and their goods that you enjoy. Do you observe how he seems to be rebuking the one, while he is sharp upon the other?</p>
<p><q>But if you boast,</q> he says, <q>you bear not the root, but the root you.</q></p>
<p>Now what is this to the branches that are cut off? Nothing. For, as I said before, while seeming to devise a sort of weak shadow of consolation, and in the very midst of his aiming at the Gentile, he gives them a mortal blow; for by saying, <q>boast not against them,</q> and, <q>if you boast, you bear not the root,</q> he has shown the Jew that the things done deserved boasting of, even if it was not right to boast, thus at once rousing him and provoking him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and smiting at him, in the attitude of an advocate, and pointing out to him the punishment he was undergoing, and that other men had possession of what were their goods.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 19</font></u></a>. <q>You will say then,</q> he goes on, <q>The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.</q></p>
<p>Again he establishes, by way of objection, the opposite to the former position, to show that what he said before, he had not said as directly belonging to the subject, but to draw them to him. For it was no longer by their fall that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> came to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, nor was it their fall that was the riches of the world. Nor was it by this that we were saved, because they had fallen, but the reverse. And he shows that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> in regard to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> was a main object, even though he seems to put what he says into another form. And the whole passage is a tissue of objections, in which he clears himself of the suspicion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>, and makes his language such as will be acceptable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 20</font></u></a>. <q>Well,</q> he praises what they said, then he alarms them again by saying, <q>Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you are grafted in by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>So here another encomium, and for the other party an accusation. But he again lays their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> low by proceeding to say, <q>be not high-minded, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.</q> For the thing is not matter of nature, but of belief and unbelief. And he seems to be again bridling the Gentile, but he is teaching the Jew that it is not right to cling to a natural kinsmanship. Hence he goes on with, <q>Be not high-minded,</q> and he does not say, but be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>, but, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For haughtiness genders a contempt and listlessness. Then as he is going into all the sorrows of their calamity, in order to make the statement less offensive, he states it in the way of a rebuke given to the other as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 21</font></u></a>. <q>For if God spared not the natural branches,</q> and then he does not say, neither will He spare you, but <q>take heed, lest He also spare not you.</q> So paring (<span>ὑ</span> <span>ποτεμνόμενος</span>) away the distasteful from his statement, representing the believer as in the struggle, he at once draws the others to him, and humbles these also.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 22</font></u></a>. <q>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness: otherwise thou also shall be cut off.</q></p>
<p>And he does not say, Behold your well doing, behold your labors, but, <q>Behold the goodness of God</q> toward man, to show that the whole comes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> from above, and to make us tremble. For this reason for boasting should make you to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>: since the Lord (<span>δεσπότης</span>) has been good unto you, do thou therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For the blessings do not abide by you unmovable if you turn listless, as neither do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> with them, if they alter; <q>For thou also,</q> he says, <q>unless thou continue in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, will be cut off.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 23</font></u></a>. <q>And they also, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in.</q></p>
<p>For it was not God that cut them off, but they have broken themselves off and fallen, and he did well to say have broken themselves off. For He has never yet so (Sav. conj. manuscript corr. <span>οὗτος</span>) cast them off, though they have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a> so much and so often. You see what a great thing a man's free choice is, how great the efficacy of the mind is. For none of these things is immutable, neither your good nor his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. You see too how he raises up even him in his despondency, and humbles the other in his confidence; and do not thou be faint at hearing of severity, nor thou be confident at hearing of goodness. The reason why He cut you off in severity was, that you might long to come back. The reason why He showed goodness to you was, that you might continue in (he does not say the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, but) His goodness, that is, if you do things worthy of God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man. For there is need of something more than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. You see how he suffers neither these to lie low, nor those to be elated, but he also provokes them to jealousy, by giving through them a power to the Jew to be set again in this one's place, as he also had first taken the other's ground. And the Gentile he put in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and what had happened to them, lest they should feel elated over it. But the Jew he tries to encourage by what had been afforded to the Greek. For thou also, he says, will be cut off if you grow listless, (for the Jew was cut off), and he will be grafted in if he be earnest, for thou also wast grafted in. But it is very judicious in him to direct all he says to the Gentile, as he is always in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of doing, correcting the feeble by rebuking the stronger. This he does in the end of this Epistle too, when he is speaking of the observance of meats. Then, he grounds this on what had already happened, not upon what was to come only. And this was more likely to persuade his hearer. And as he means to enter on consecutiveness of reasonings, such as could not be spoken against, he first uses a demonstration drawn from the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For if they were cut off, and cast aside, and others took precedence of them in what was theirs, still even now despair not.</p>
<p><q>For God is able,</q> he says, <q>to graft them in again,</q> since He does things beyond expectation. But if you wish for things to be in order, and reasons to be consecutive, you have from yourselves a demonstration which more than meets your wants.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 24</font></u></a>. <q>For if you were cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree.</q></p>
<p>If then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> was able to do what was contrary to nature, much more will it that which is according to nature. For if this person, who was cut off from those by nature his fathers, came contrary to nature unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, much more will you be able to recover your own. For the Gentile's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> lot is according to nature (he being by nature a wild olive), and the good contrary to nature (it being contrary to nature for him to be grafted into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>), but your lot on the contrary is the good by nature. For it is not upon another root, as the Gentile, but on your own that you are to be fixed if you are minded to come back. What then do you deserve, when after the Gentile had been able to do what was contrary to nature, you are not able to do that which is according to nature, but hast given up even this? Then as he had said <q>contrary to nature,</q> and, <q>were grafted in,</q> that you may not suppose the Jew to have the advantage, he again corrects this by saying that he also is grafted in. <q>How much more shall these,</q> says he, <q>which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive-tree?</q> And again, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is able to graft them in.</q> And before this he says, that if they <q>abide not still in unbelief, they shall be also grafted in.</q> And when you hear that he keeps speaking of <q>according to nature,</q> and <q>contrary to nature,</q> do not suppose that he means the nature that is unchangeable, but he tells us in these words of the probable and the consecutive, and on the other hand of the improbable. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things and the bad are not such as are by nature, but by temper and determination alone. And consider also how inoffensive he is. For after saying that thou also will be cut off, if you dost not abide in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and these will be grafted in, if they <q>abide not still in unbelief,</q> he leaves that of harsh aspect, and insists on that of kindlier sound, and in it he ends, putting great hopes before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> if they were minded not to abide so. Wherefore he goes on to say,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 25</font></u></a>. <q>For I would not, brethren, that you should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>, lest ye should be wise your own conceits.</q></p>
<p>Meaning by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> here, that which is unknown and unutterable, and has much of wonder and much of what one should not expect about it. As in another passage too he says, <q>Behold, I tell you a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse51" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:51</font></u></a></span> What then is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>?</p>
<p><q>That blindness in part has happened unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> Here again he levels a blow at the Jew, while seeming to take down the Gentile. But his meaning is nearly this, and he had said it before, that the unbelief is not universal, but only <q>in part.</q> As when he says, <q>But if any has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co002.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 2:5</font></u></a></span>: And, so here too he says what he had said above, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has not cast off His people whom He foreknew</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 11:2</font></u></a></span>: and again, <q>What then? Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 11:11</font></u></a></span>: This then he says here also; that it is not the whole people that is pulled up, but many have already <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, and more are likely to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. Then as he had promised a great thing, he adduces the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> in evidence, speaking as follows. Now it is not for the fact of a blindness having happened that he quotes the passage (for every one could see that), but that they shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> and be saved, he brings Isaiah to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, who cries aloud and says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 26</font></u></a>. <q>There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa059.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 59:20</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Then to give the mark that fixes its sense to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, to prevent any one from drawing it aside and attaching it to times gone by, he says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 27</font></u></a>. <q>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Not when they are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a>, not when they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, not when they do the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of the Law, but when they attain to the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. If then this has been promised, but has never yet happened in their case, nor have they ever enjoyed the remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>, certainly it will come to pass. Hence he proceeds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 29</font></u></a>. <q>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q></p>
<p>And even this is not all he says to solace them, for he uses what had already come about. And what came in of consequence, that he states as chiefly intended, putting it in these words,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 28</font></u></a>. <q>As concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</q></p>
<p>That the Gentile then might not be puffed up, and say, <q>I am standing, do not tell me of what would have been, but what has been,</q> he uses this consideration to bring him down, and says, <q>As concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, they are enemies for your sakes.</q> For when you were called they became more captious. Nevertheless God has not even now cut short the calling of you, but He waits for all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> that are to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> to come in, and then they also shall come. Then he does them another kind favor, by saying, <q>As touching election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes.</q> And what is this? For wherein they are enemies, punishment is theirs: but wherein they are beloved, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of their ancestors has no influence on them, if they do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. Nevertheless, as I said, he ceases not to solace them with words, that he may bring them over. Wherefore by way of fresh <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> for his former assertion, he says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 30-32</font></u></a>. <q>For as you in times past have not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also now not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy. For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.</q></p>
<p>He shows here that those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> were called first. Then, as they would not come, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were elected, and the same result occurred again. For when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> would not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, again the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> were brought over. And he does not stop here, nor does he draw the whole to a conclusion at their rejection, but at their having mercy shown them again. See how much he gives to those of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, as much as he did to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> before. For when you, he would say, <q>in times past did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>,</q> being of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> came in. Again, when these did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>, you have come. However, they will not perish forever. <q>For God has concluded them all in unbelief,</q> that is, has convinced them, has shown them disobedient; not that they may remain in disobedience, but that He may save the one by the captiousness of the other, these by those and those by these. Now consider; you were disobedient, and they were saved. Again, they have been disobedient, and you have been saved. Yet you have not been so saved as to be put away again, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were, but so as to draw them over through jealousy while you abide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 33</font></u></a>. <q>Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of God! How unsearchable are His judgments!</q></p>
<p>Here after going back to former times, and looking back to God's original dispensation of things whereby the world has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existed</font></u></a> up to the present time, and having considered what special provision He had made for all occurrences, he is stricken with awe, and cries aloud, so making his hearers feel confident that certainly that will come to pass which he says. For he would not have cried aloud and been awe-struck, unless this was quite sure to come to pass. That it is a depth then, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>: but how great, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not. For the language is that of a person wondering, not of one that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the whole. But admiring and being awe-struck at the goodliness, so far forth as in him lay, he heralds it forth by two intensitive words, riches and depth, and then is awestruck at His having had both the will and the power to do all this, and by opposites effecting opposites. <q>How unsearchable are His judgments.</q> For they are not only impossible to be comprehended, but even to be searched. <q>And His ways past finding out;</q> that is, His dispensations for these also are not only impossible to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>, but even to be sought into. For even I, he means, have not found out the whole, but a little part, not all. For He alone <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> His own clearly. Wherefore he proceeds:</p>
<p>Ver. 34, 35. <q>For who has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</q></p>
<p>What he means is nearly this: that though He is so wise, yet He has not His Wisdom from any other, but is Himself the Fountain of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things. And though He has done so great things, and made us so great presents, yet it was not by borrowing from any other that He gave them, but by making them spring forth from Himself; nor as owing any a return for having received from him, but as always being Himself the first to do the benefits; for this is a chief mark of riches, to overflow abundantly, and yet need no aid. Wherefore he proceeds to say, <q>For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things.</q> Himself devised, Himself created, Himself works together (Vulg. <span>συγκρατεἵ</span>, manuscripts <span>συγκροτεἵ</span>). For He is rich, and needs not to receive from another. And wise, and needs no counsellor. Why speak I of a counsellor? To <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the things of Him is no one able, save Himself alone, the Rich and Wise One. For it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of much riches that He should make them of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> thus well supplied; and of much wisdom that He should constitute the inferiors of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> their teachers. Then as he was awe-struck he offers up thanksgiving also in the word, <q>To Whom be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> forever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>For when he tells of any great and unutterable thing of this kind, he ends in wonder with a doxology. And this he does in regard to the Son also. For in that passage also he went on to the very same thing that he does here. Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, Who is over all God blessed forever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom009.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 9:5</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Him then let us also imitate, and let us glorify God in all things, by a heedful way of life, and let us not feel confidence in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtues</font></u></a> of our ancestry, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> the example that has been made of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. For this is not, certainly it is not, the relationship of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>, for theirs is the kinsmanship of the Spirit. So the Scythian becomes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> son: and his son on the other hand more of an alien to him than the Scythian. Let us not then feel confidence in the well-doings of our fathers (most manuscripts <q>of others</q>), but if you have a parent who is a marvel even, fancy not that this will be enough to save you, or to get you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, unless you have the relationship of character to him. So too if you have a bad one, do not think that you will be condemned on this account, or be put to shame if at least you order your own doings aright. For what can be less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>? Still in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> they soon became related to the Saints. Or what more nearly connected than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? Yet still by unbelief they were made aliens. For that relationship is of nature and necessity, after which we are all relations. For of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> we all sprung, and none can be more a relation than another, both as regards <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> and as regards <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11088a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Noah</font></u></a>, and as regards the earth, the common mother of all. But the relationship worthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>, is that which does distinguish us from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>. For it is not possible for all to be relations in this way, but those of the same character only. Nor do we call them brothers who come of the same labor with ourselves, but those who display the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>. In this way Christ gives men the name of children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and so on the other hand children of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and so too children of disobedience, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and of perdition likewise. So Timothy was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> son from goodness and was called <q>my own son</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 1:2</font></u></a></span>: but of his sister's son we do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> even the name. And yet the one was by nature related to him, and still that availed him not. But the other being both by nature and country far removed from him (as being a native of Lystra), still became most nearly related. Let us then also become the sons of the Saints, or rather let us become even God's sons. For that it is possible to become sons of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, hear what he says, <q>Be therefore perfect, as your father which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse48" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:48</font></u></a></span> This is why we call Him Father in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, and that not only to remind ourselves of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, but also of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that we may not do anything unworthy of such a relationship. And how it may be said is it possible to be a son of God? By being free from all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and showing gentleness to them that affront and wrong us. For your Father is so to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> Him. Wherefore, though He says various things at various times, yet in no case does He say that you may be like your Father, but when He says, <q>Pray for them that despitefully use you, do good to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:44</font></u></a></span>, then He brings in this as the reward. For there is nothing that brings us so near to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and makes us so like Him, as this well-doing. Therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also, when he says, <q>Be followers of God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:1</font></u></a></span>, means them to be so in this respect. For we have need of all good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, chiefly however of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to man and gentleness, since we need so much of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to man ourselves. For we commit many transgressions every day. Wherefore also we have need to show much mercy. But much and little is not measured by the quantity of things given, but by the amount of the givers' means. Let not then the rich be high-minded, nor the poor dejected as giving so little, for the latter often gives more than the former. We must not then make ourselves miserable because we are poor, since it makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">almsgiving</font></u></a> the easier for us. For he that has got much together is seized with haughtiness, as well as a greater affection to that (or <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> beyond that</q>) he has. But he that has but a little is quit of either of these domineering <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>: hence he finds more occasions for doing well. For this man will go cheerfully into a prison-house, and will visit the sick, and will give a cup of cold water. But the other will not take upon him any office of this sort, as pampered up (<span>φλεγμαίνων</span>) by his riches. Be not then out of heart at your poverty. For your poverty makes your traffic for heaven the easier to you. And if you have nothing, but have a compassionating <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, even this will be laid up as a reward for you. Hence too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> bade us <q>weep with them that weep</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom012.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 12:15</font></u></a></span>, and exhorted us to be to prisoners as though bound with them. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb013.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 13:3</font></u></a></span> For it is not to them that weep only that it yields some solace that there be many that compassionate them, but to them who are in other afflicting circumstances. For there are cases where conversation has as much power to recover him that is cast down as money. For this then God exhorts us to give money to them that ask, not merely with a view to relieve their poverty, but that He may teach us to compassionate the misfortunes of our neighbors. For this also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man is odious, in that he not only disregards men in a beggared state, but because he gets himself trained (<span>ἀ</span> <span>λείφεται</span>) for cruelty and great inhumanity. And so he that, for their sakes, thinks little of money, is even on this account an object of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, that he is merciful and kind to man. And Christ, when He blesses the merciful, blesses and praises not those only that give the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> of money, but those also who have the will to do so. Let us then be so inclinable to mercy, and all other blessings will follow, for he that has a spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> and mercy, if he have money, will give it away, or if he see any in distress, will weep and bewail it; if he fall in with a person wronged, will stand up for him; if he sees one spitefully entreated, will reach out his hand to him. For as he has that treasure-house of blessings, a loving and merciful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, he will make it a fountain for all his brethren's needs, and will enjoy all the rewards that are laid up with God (Field with 4 manuscripts <span>τᾥ θεᾥ</span>). That we then may attain to these, let us of all things frame our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> accordingly. For so, while in this world, we shall do good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> without number, and shall enjoy the crowns to come. To which may we all attain by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward man, etc.</p>

with the greatest pleasure and the most intimate satisfaction the questions
which you have kindly addressed to me, Simplicien, my father; and if I did not
endeavor to answer it, I would do not only blameworthy resistance, but
ingratitude. We had already discussed in some way, and even in writing, the
difficulties you are proposing concerning the Apostle St. Paul. However little
satisfied with previous researches and explanations, I have studied with more
care and attention the words of the Apostle and all his thoughts. For you would
not submit them to our examination, if the intelligence was easy and accessible
to all.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>FIRST
QUESTION. -</strong> What does St. Paul think of the Old Law? - 1. The first question
you asked me for clarification extends from these words: "What shall we
say then? Is the law sin? Not at all, "up to these:" The law is
therefore good for me if I will, "and what follows, including, I think,
that passage unhappy man that I am, who will deliver me from body of this
death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord? Here the Apostle seems
to me to have personified, in himself the man subject to the old law, and to
have adopted language for his own account. And as he said above, "We are
freed from the law of death in which we were kept, that we may serve in the
newness of the spirit, and not in the dilapidation of the letter; And that
these words might pass for a reproach against the Law, he hastens to add:
"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Far from there. But I only knew
sin by the law. For I would not know concupiscence, if the law had not said,
Thou shalt not covet.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. One
might object here: Although the Law is not sin, but only gives occasion for it,
it is none the less blamed by these words of the Apostle. It must be
understood, then, that the Law was given neither to produce nor to destroy sin,
but only to make it known, to convince of its guilt the soul which thought
itself almost assured of its innocence; so that sin could be conquered only by
grace, she became anxious about her fault and turned to the side of grace. So
the Apostle does not say, "I have committed sin only by the Law, but I
have known sin only by the Law. He does not say either: I would not have
coveted, if the Law had not said: Thou shalt not covet, but: I would not know
concupiscence, if the Law had not said, Thou shalt not covet. From which it
follows that the Law did not produce, but merely made known concupiscence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. Now,
since grace was not yet available to resist concupiscence, it had to be
increased. Indeed, when the crime of formal resistance is added to it, when it
acts against the Law, it has more force than if it were not forbidden by any
law. This is why the Apostle adds: "Now, taking occasion of command, sin
has produced in me all concupiscence. Concupiscence already existed before the Law,
but not entirely, because there was not yet formal resistance. So Saint Paul
says elsewhere: "For where there is no law, there is no
prevarication." (Rom. IV, 15.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. As for
the following: "For without the law sin is dead," it is as if he were
saying: Sin is hidden, that is to say, it is supposed to be dead.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This is
what he will clearly express a little further down. "And I," he
continues, "I used to live. without law; That is to say, death, fruit of
sin, did not terrify me, because sin did not appear, since there was no law.
"But when the commandment came, sin re-lived," that is to say, it is
made to see. "And I am dead," that is to say, I understood that I was
dead; I know at least that prevarication holds me under the threat of certain
death. Evidently these words: "When the commandment came, the sin has
re-lived," indicate enough that sin once lived, that is to say, it seems
to me, has shown itself in the prevarication of the first man, since he had
himself received a command (Gen. II, 17). For the Apostle says elsewhere:
"But the seduced woman fell into prevarication (2 I Tim. II, 14); And
again: "By a prevarication similar to that of Adam, who is the figure of
him who was to come (Rom, V, 14). Because to relive one must have lived. But
sin was dead, that is to say hidden, because men, born mortal, lived without
Law and followed the lusts of the flesh without suspecting it: for there was no
defense. So: "And I used to live without law," says the Apostle. By
this he clearly shows that he does not speak in his own name, but in general
and in the name of the old man. "But when command came, sin re-lived. And
I am dead; it turned out that this command,. who was to give me life, caused my
death. Indeed, if one obeys the commandment, it is certainly life. But it
turned out that he caused death, because to sin against the commandment is not
only to sin, (it was already sinned before) but it is to sin with more malice
and perversity, then evil is done knowingly and by formal disobedience.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5.
"For," continues the Apostle, "the sin taking occasion of the
commandment has seduced me and by him has killed me. The sin abusing the Law,
while the defense increased covetousness, became more pleasant and seduced us.
For it is a deceitful sweetness, which is followed by more numerous
punishments, greater and more bitter. As the man who has not yet received
spiritual grace has more attraction for a defended action, sin seduces by a
false sweetness; and the prevarication added to it, he kills.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6.
"Thus the law is holy and command it holy, just and good. Indeed the law
orders and defends what is needed. "What is good has become for me death?
Far from there. Evil is in the abuser, and not in the commandment itself, which
is good. Because the law is good, if it is used legitimately (I Tim.I, 8). But
that one who is abusing them does not submit himself to God in a pious
humility, to be able to fulfill the Law by means of grace. Thus he who does not
legitimately use the law receives it only to provide, by his prevarication, to
appear his sin which was hidden before the defense. And that beyond measure;
Because it is no longer simply a sin, but a disobedience to the commandment.
The Apostle then continues, adding: "But sin, to appear sinned, has, by a
good thing, made death for me; so that the commandment has made the sinner or
the sin exceedingly guilty. By this he explains the meaning of what he has said
above. For without the Law sin is dead; Not that he did not exist, but he did
not appear; and in what sense he also said, "Sin has re-lived," which
does not mean that sin existed only after the law, but only then it appeared as
disobedience to the law; since in this same place the Apostle says: "But
sin, to appear sin, has, by a good thing, made death for me. He does not say:
To be sin, but: "To appear sin. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. Then he
gives the reason: "For we know that the law is spiritual, and I am carnal.
It is sufficiently clear here that the Law can only be fulfilled by spiritual
men, who become such only by grace. In fact, the closer man comes to the spiritual
Law, that is, the more his affections rise in the spiritual order, the better
he fulfills the Law; because he finds there a greater pleasure, seeing that he
is no longer overwhelmed under his weight, but fortified with his light; for
the command of the Lord is luminous and brightens the eyes, his law is pure and
converts souls; (Ps. XVIII, 8, 9.) grace remits sins and pouring out the spirit
of charity which does not deprive virtue only of what it has painful, but makes
it pleasant. Obviously after saying, "And I'm carnal," he had to
explain how much. For those who are already under the influence of grace are
also called carnal in a certain sense.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Already
redeemed from the blood of the Lord, and born to the life of faith, To these
the Apostle said, "Therefore, my brethren; I myself could not speak to you
as to spiritual men, as to carnal men, as to little children in Christ Jesus; I
have watered you in fact, "But I neither laugh nor give you food (1 Cor.
III,1, 2)." I must see from this that they were born to the life of grace,
they who are little children of Jesus Christ and whom we must drink of milk,
and yet he still calls them carnal. As for him who is not yet under the rule of
grace, but under that of the law; he is carnal in the sense that he is not
freed from sin, but sold as a slave to sin because he seeks, as the price of a
fatal pleasure, the very sweetness that seduces him and that he has violated
the law , with all the more pleasure that the defense is more formal. But he
can not accept this sweetness as a reward suitable to his condition without
being forced to undergo the yoke of passion as a slave bought. He feels that he
is the slave of the passion that controls him; he to whom a defense is made,
who knows perfectly this defense and yet the transgress,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"So what I do, I do not understand it:" These expressions: "I do
not understand it," do not mean to say: I do not know that I sin;
otherwise the Apostle would contradict himself, since he said: "Sin, to
appear sin, has, by a good thing; operated in me death; And above: "I knew
sin only by the law. How would sin appear, how would he know it, if he did not
know? But he speaks in the same sense as the Lord, when he once said
self-wicked, "I do not know you (Matt. XXV,12):" For nothing escapes
God, since he has open fires on those who do evil, in order to erase their
memory here below (Ps. XXXIII, 17). Sometimes, for ourselves, to ignore means
not to approve. So when the Apostle says, "What I do, I do not understand
it," that means I do not approve of it. This is what the following
demonstrates when he adds: "For what I want, I do not do it; but what I
hate, I do it. I hate here the sense of ignorance, as of those to whom the Lord
will say: "I do not know you," it is written, "You hate, O Lord;
to all those who commit iniquity (Ps V, 7)."</font></span><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"If I do what I do not want, I accept the law as good. He does not want
what the law does not want because the law defends what he does. He therefore
agrees with the law, not so much as he relaxes, but because he does not want
what he does. He is conquered because he is not yet delivered by grace,
although he already knows by your law that he is doing evil and that he does
not want to do it. As for the following: "Now therefore, it is no longer I
who do this, but the sin that dwells in me," that does not mean that he
does not consent to do evil, even though he is agree with the law to condemn
it. For he speaks again in the name of man established under the rule of the
law (Ret. l. I, ch. I.) and not under that of grace; of man, therefore, led to do so by the
concupiscence which dominates him and seduces him by the false sweetness of the
forbidden sin, although he disapproves of it, enlightened by the law. "I
do not do it," means: I do it because I'm defeated. It is indeed passion
that acts; she is yielded because she is the mistress. But not to yield, to
strengthen the soul against passion, must grace, which the Apostle will speak.</span></p></span><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">10.
"For I know," he says, "that good does not dwell in me, that is,
in my flesh. As far as he knows, he is in agreement with the law; but insofar
as he acts, he yields to sin. Now where does he know what he is saying, that
what dwells in his flesh is not good, but sin? Whence does he know it, except
by the transmission of the mortality of mortality and the continual assaults of
voluptuousness? One is the punishment of original sin, the other the punishment
for frequent relapses in sin. We bring it one by coming into the world, we add
the other during our life. These two things, nature and habit combined, make
passion very powerful, very difficult to overcome; this is what the Apostle
calls here sin, and which he declares to dwell in his flesh, that is to say, to
exert an entire domination, a kind of empire. It is in this sense that we read
in the Psalmist: "I would rather be last in the house of the Lord than
dwell in the tents of sinners (Ps. LXXXIII, 11)" as if he who is despised
wherever he may be, he was not regarded as inhabitant; which connects with the
word habitation the idea of ​​any domination. But if grace produces in us the
effect that the Apostle expresses elsewhere in these terms: "Let not sin
reign in our mortal bodies, until we make them obey his lusts (Romans vii.,
12)." we can no longer properly say that sin dwells in us.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">11.
"Indeed the will is in May, but to do good, I do not find it. These words,
for those who do not understand them well, almost seem to destroy free will.
But how would that be, since the Apostle says, "Willingness resides in me?
Certainly the will is in our power, since it resides in us; but if we can not
do good, the fault is in original sin. This is not the primitive nature of man,
but the pain of sin; whence results mortality itself, fragility which has
become second nature, and from which we are delivered by the grace of the
Creator, when we submit to him by faith. But all these expressions apply only
to the man established under the law, and not yet under grace. Indeed, he who
is not yet under grace, does not do the good he wants; but he does the evil he
does not want, because he is dominated by concupiscence, fortified by the link
of mortality, and also by the training of habit. But if he does what he does
not wind, it is not he who does it, but the sin that dwells in him, according
to what has been said and explained above.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">12. So
when I rejoice in doing good, I find "a law that opposes it, because evil
dwells in me; That is to say, I find that the law is good for me when I want to
do what it commands, but the evil lies in me because of the facility to commit
it. It is this facility that the Apostle hears, when he says above: "The
will resides in me. Indeed, what is easier for the man established under the
law to shear for good and do evil? He wants good without difficulty, although
he has less facility to do it than to want it; and he easily does the harm he
hates, though he does not want it; he is like a man violently pushed, who
arrives without difficulty at the bottom of the precipice, although he does not
want it. though he dreads it extremely. I say this because of the word of the
Apostle: "Reside. So the man established under the law and not yet freed
by grace, testifies to the law that it is good: he returns it to him completely
by the very fact that he reproaches himself for acting against it, and he finds
that it is good for him, since he wants to do what he commands, but he can not
because of the empire of concupiscence; he is thus guilty of prevarication, and
forced to implore the grace of the Deliverer.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

"I delight, indeed, in the law of stake, according to the inner man, in
the you who say; you will not covet. But I see in my members another law which
combats the law of your mind, and captivates me under the law of sin, which is
in my members. "He calls the law of its members the very weight of
mortality under which we groan (II<span>  </span>Cor.
V, 4.), because the body, which corrupts, weighs down the soul (2 Sag. IX, 15.).
From which it often results that what is not allowed charm irresistibly. This
overwhelming, crushing burden, he calls it law, speaks of it as a just
punishment, a divine judgment given and inflicted by the One who warned the
man, saying, "From the day you eat that fruit, you die of death (Gen. II,
17). This law combats the law of the spirit which says, "You shall not
covet," and in which man delights according to the inner man; and before
he is under the influence of grace, he fights so much that she captivates him
under the law of sin, that is, under his own yoke. For saying, "Which is
in my members," the Apostle makes it quite clear that it is the same as
the one he said above: "I see in my members another law. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">14. The
object of all this is to show that the man so captive must not presume his
strength. It was the hub of confusing the pride of the Jews who boasted of the
works of the Law, even though they were driven by concupiscence to commit all
kinds of evil, although the law of which they were so proud tells them:
"You will not covet. So the man vanquished, condemned, prisoner,
prevaricator rather than conqueror, after having even received the law, must
say, must exclaim with humility: "Unhappy man that I am, who will deliver
me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ-Our Lord.
Indeed, all that remains in free will in this mortal life is not to perform
justice when the man wants it, but to resort with pious entreaties to the One
who can give him to accomplish it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">15. Would
it be imagined, from the text we have just expounded, that the Apostle judges
the law bad? He said, "The law has come to make sin abound (Rom. V, 20);
the ministry of death was engraved in letters on stones (II Co. III, 7.); The
strength of sin is the law (I Cor. XV); you have died to the law by the body of
Christ, to be to another, to Him. who has risen from the dead (Rom. VII, 4);
the passions of sin, which were occasioned by the law, acted in our members
until they produced "fruits for death; but now we are freed from the law
of death in which we were kept, so that we may serve in the novelty of the
spirit, and not in the dilapidation of the letter (Ib. 5, 6.). He said that,
and other things of the same kind; but it must be remembered that these
expressions simply mean that the law increases concupiscence by defense, and
that it binds the culprit by prevarication, by giving orders which men can not
fulfill because of their infirmity, unless they do not humbly resort to the
grace of God. This is why it is said that those whom she dominates are under
her; and she dominates those whom she punishes, that is to say, all the
prevaricators. But those who have received the law prevail against it, unless
grace enables them to execute what it commands. Thus it does not dominate those
who are under grace, because they did it out of love, they who were condemned
when they were under the yoke of fear.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">16. Zion
is carried by these texts of the Apostle to believe that he blames the law,
what will be said of these words: "I indulge in the law of God,"
according to the inner man? Obviously this is a eulogy of the law. But to this
we answer that he speaks here of another law, that is to say, of the law of
Christ, and not of that which was given to the Jews. We will then ask what law
the Apostle said: "The law came to make sin abound? It is said without
hesitation that it is Jewish law. See, then, is it also of this that it is
said, "Now, taking occasion of command, sin has produced in me all
concupiscence. These expressions: "Has produced in me all
concupiscence," do they mean anything but these: "In order to make
sin abound? See again if this is not the meaning of these words: "So that
the commandment has made the sinner or the sin exceedingly guilty. Indeed,
"To make sin more than guilty" comes down to: "That sin should
abound. If, then, we prove that the commandment is good, the commandment of
which sin has taken occasion to effect all concupiscence, to the point of
exceeding the measure; we will prove by this very fact that the law is good, it
has come for sin to abound, that is to say for sin to operate all concupiscence
and to exceed all measure. Let us therefore listen to the same Apostle:
"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Far from there. But, we are told,
this applies to the law of Christ, that is, to the law of grace. Let us then be
told how we hear the following: "But I knew sin only by the law. For I
would not know concupiscence, if the law had not said, Thou shalt not covet.
Now, taking occasion of command, sin has wrought all concupiscence in me. The
context shows enough of what law he speaks when he says, "Is the law sin?
Far from there. Evidently it is the one whose command has given to sin the
opportunity of operating all concupiscence, and consequently of that which has
come about for sin to abound and to be evil.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But what
is more clear than the words added by the Apostle: "So the law is holy,
and the command holy, just and good?" We are still told that it is the
Gospel, not the Jewish law: so great, so blind is the Manichean perversity!
They do not pay attention to the passage so express, so obvious, which comes
after. "What is good has become for me death? Far from there ; but sin, to
appear sin, has, by a good thing, made death for me, so that the commandment
has made the sinner or the sin exceedingly guilty; That is to say, the holy
commandment, just and good, which nevertheless arose so that sin abounded, that
is, exceeded all measure.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">17. Why,
then, if the law is good, is it called "ministry of death?" Because
sin, "to appear sin, has, by a good thing, operated for me death. Do not
be surprised, since it has been said of the very preaching of the Gospel:
"We are for God the good odor of Christ to those who flee and to those who
are lost ; "To some smell of life for life, but to others smell of death
for death (Rom. XIII, 8, 10). The law has been called the ministry of death to
the Jews, for whom it was written on stone, emblem of the hardness of their
heart; but not for those who fulfill it for love. Because love is the fullness
of the law. Indeed, the law, written on the stone, says, "Thou shalt not
commit adultery; You will not be homicidal; You will not steal; You will not
covet, all things that are fulfilled for love, to the testimony of the Apostle,
who says to us, "He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. For you
shall not commit adultery; You will not kill; You will not steal; Thou shalt
not covet, and if there be any other commandment, all is summed up in this
word: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, 1 because this word is written
in the law.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If the law
is good, why is it "the strength of sin? Because sin has, by a good thing,
brought about death, so that it has exceeded the measure, that is to say, it
has been fortified by the prevarication.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If the law
is good, "why are we dead by the body of Christ? Because, delivered from
the affection which the law punishes and condemns, we are dead to the law which
condemns. Indeed, it is especially when it threatens, terrifies or strikes,
that it is given the name of law. Thus the same precept is the law for those
who fear, and grace for those who do it with love. Hence this word of the Gospel
The law was given by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ (2 Jn, I, 17).
Indeed, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ to fulfill the very law,
which was given by Moses to inspire fear. So: "You are dead to law,"
means: You have died to the torture of the law, "by the body of
Christ," for which sins were forgiven which made them liable to just
punishment.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If the law
is good, why "did the passions of sin which are occasioned by the law, act
in our members, until they produce fruit of death? Because the Apostle here
hears from these passions of the sin of which he has often been spoken, the
increase of the concupiscence occasioned by the defense, and the punishment
imposed on the prevarication: that is to say, because the sin "By a good
thing done death, so that the commandment has made the sinner or the sin
exceedingly guilty. "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">If the law
is good, why are we "free from the law of death in which we were kept,
that we may serve in the novelty of the spirit, and not in the dilapidation of
the letter? Because the law is only the letter for those who do not fulfill it
with this spirit of charity, which is the purpose of the New Testament. Thus
those who have died to sin are freed from the letter in which are held the
guilty who do not fulfill what is written. Indeed, what is the law, if not a
simple letter for those who can read it and can not do it? For those for whom
it was written know it; but as they know it only in so far as it is written,
and not to love and fulfill it, it is only for them the letter: a letter which
is of no help to those who read it, but bear witness against those who sin.
Therefore those who are renewed by the Spirit are freed from his condemnation;
they no longer cling to the letter to find punishment, but to intelligence for
the sake of justice. Hence the word: "The letter kills, but the spirit
gives life (II Cor. III, 6). Indeed the law only Luke, but not understood or
not fulfilled, certainly kills; and that's when it's called a letter. "But
the spirit gives life, because the fullness of the law is charity, which has
been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us (Rom. V, 5).

St. Paul on justification. - (1). It is time, I think, to move on to the other
question you have given us, that is to say, to explain the whole text, from
this verse: "And not only she, but also Rebecca who had two sons at a time
from Isaac, our father. Because before they were born, or they had done good or
bad; Up to this one: "If the Lord of Hosts had not reserved for us an
offspring, we would have become like Sodom and like Gomorrah. This passage is
certainly darker than the other. But as I know you, you have not been able to
demand of me this work without asking God for me the grace to do it. Emboldened
by this thought, I enter immediately into matter.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">2. First
of all, I shall not lose sight of the goal which the Apostle proposes in all
his Epistle, and I will take him for a guide. This goal is to prevent anyone
from boasting about the merit of his works, like the Jews who dared to boast of
having observed the law they had been given, claiming to have received
evangelical grace as a reward due to their merit, to their fidelity to this law
and consequently, did not want the same grace to be granted to the Gentiles,
that they deemed it unworthy, unless they professed Judaism, This question,
raised above, his solution in the Acts of the Apostles (Act XV). The Jews,
therefore, did not understand that this benefit, being evangelical grace, is
not the reward of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace (Rom. (?), 6).
In many places St. Paul attests to it, always putting the grace of faith above
works, not to destroy them, but to show that instead of preceding grace, good
works follow it; and that no one should imagine having received grace for doing
good, but understanding that he can not do good without having received grace
by faith.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Now man
begins to receive grace when, attracted to faith by a voice from within or
without, he begins to believe in God. But it is important to distinguish in
what moments, by the reception of which sacraments grace descends more full,
more manifest. The catechumens are not without it; or it should be said that
Corneille did not believe in God, who, by his prayers and alms, made himself
worthy to be visited by an angel (Act. X, 1-4.). Now he would not have done so,
if at first he had not believed; and he would not have believed, if he had not
been called, or by some mysterious visions of soul and spirit, or by some
external and sensible manifestations. In some, the grace of faith is
insufficient to obtain the kingdom of heaven, as in the catechumens, for
example, or at Cornelius himself, before he was incorporated into the Church by
receiving sacraments; in others it is so great that they are part of the body
of Christ and become the temple of God. "For the temple of God is
holy," says the Apostle, "and you are this temple (Cor. III,<span>  </span>17)." And the Lord Himself: "If
anyone does not be reborn from the water and the Holy Spirit, he can not enter
the kingdom of heaven (Jn, III, 5.). There are, then, beginnings of faith
analogous to conception; but to reach eternal life, it is not enough to be
conceived, one must be born. Nothing, however, of all this takes place without
the grace of divine mercy, because good works, if there are any, accompany
grace, as we have said, but do not precede it.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">3. This is
what the Apostle wants to persuade. He says elsewhere: "It is the grace of
God that saved us by faith, and it does not come from us, for it is a gift from
God; neither works, so that no one may boast (Eph. II, 8, 9.); Here he applies
this principle to children who have not yet been born. No one can say that
Jacob, before his birth, deserved by his works that God says of him: "The
eldest will serve under the youngest. "So not only her," says the
Apostle, (for Isaac was promised, when God said, "In that time will I
come, and Sarah will have a son;" and that son certainly had not deserved
by his works that his birth was promised, that in Isaac was called the race of
Abraham, that is to say, they shared the happiness of the saints in Christ, who
would understand that they are children of the promise; would not boast of their
merits, but would attribute to the grace of the vocation the advantage of being
co-heirs of Christ, since, having not yet been born, they certainly deserved
nothing when they were promised birth;) but also Rebecca, who had two sons at
once of Isaac, our father, "He is very careful to say," at once,
"because they had been conceived together, and that is why nothing is
attributed to the merits of parents and that no one dares to say: The son is
born such, because the father or the mother were affected by such or in such a
way, at the moment of conception. Indeed the moment of conception was the same
for both. This is why the Apostle says, "At once," thus cutting short
all the observations of astrologers, or rather of those so-called horoscopesmen,
who predict the manners and destinies of men according to the circumstances of
their birth. <span> </span>In fact, they can not in
any way explain such a great difference of fate between these twin beings,
conceived in the same instant, under the same constellation, in the same state
of the sky, so much so that it is impossible to make the slightest observation.
for one that can not be applied to the other. They can easily understand by
that, if they wish, that the answers they sell to their credulous listeners,
are not based on any art, but on chances and conjectures. To return to our
subject, the Apostle cites these examples only to confound and humble the pride
of ungrateful men towards divine grace, who dare to boast of their own merits.
"For before they were born, or had done any good or evil, not because of
their works, but by the will of him who called, he was told," The eldest
will serve under the youngest."</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

therefore belongs to the one who calls; and then good works are to him who
receives grace, not as the source of this grace, but as his product. Indeed it
is not to be hot that the fire warms, but it warms because it is hot; the wheel
does not run to be round, but because it is round; thus no one does good to
receive grace, but does so because he has received it. How, indeed, the one who
has not been justified, could he live in justice? How can one who has not been
sanctified live holy? How can one who has not been quickened live? But it is
your grace that justifies, so that the one who is justified can live in
justice. Grace then laughs at first bond, and good works then, as the Apostle
says elsewhere: "But to him who works, the wages are not imputed as a
grace; but as a debt (Rom IV, 4.); As is immortality after good works, if it is
claimed as debt. It is from her that the same Apostle speaks thus: "I
fought the good fight, I finished my race, I kept the faith; I have the crown
of justice left, which the Lord, just judge, will one day return to me (I Tim.
IV, 7, 8). Perhaps the word "will give me back" presupposes a debt.
But when: "Going up to heaven he made captivity captive," he did not
return, but "given to men. (Eph. IV, 5) How, indeed, would the Apostle
dare to demand the payment of a debt, if he had not at first received the
gratuitous grace which, by justifying it, enabled him to fight against good
fight? For he had been blasphemer, persecutor, outrageous; then he obtained
mercy, as he himself testifies, (Tim I, 13) believing in him who justifies, not
the pious man (Rom. IV, 5), but the impious one, in order to render him pious
by justifying him.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

"Not because of their works, but by the will of him who calls, he was
told: The eldest will serve under the youngest. What the Apostle said above,
"For before they were born, or they had done good or evil," was a
preparation for this: "No because of their works," but by the will of
the One who calls, "which makes one wonder why he said," That the
decree of God might remain firm according to his election? How, indeed, is an
election just, how is there any election, where there is no difference? For if
Jacob was elected before he was born, without deserving, without doing
anything, he could not be, since there was no difference in determining the
choice. Likewise, if Esau was reprobated without having deserved it, since he
was not born and had not done anything when we said of him: "The eldest
will serve under the youngest," how can we say that he was precisely? What
distinction will we make, how shall we reasonably understand these words:
"I loved Jacob and hated Esau? They read, it is true, in a prophet who
wrote long after the birth and death of Jacob and Esau; however, it seems that
it is only a memory of the judgment: "And the eldest will serve under the
youngest; Stopped before they were born and that they had acted. Where does the
election come from? How could it be, since there is no difference in merits
between two men who are not born and have not done anything yet? Could it be
the difference of natures? But that would be difficult to understand since
there was only one father, one mother, one conception, one Creator. Could it be
that, as the same Creator drew from the same earth, different kinds of animals
and reproducers; he would also have created, from the same couple, in two twins
conceived together, children of a quite different nature so that the one would
attract his love and the other his hatred? There was no choice before the one
to be chosen existed. If indeed Jacob was created, to please; how did it rain
before Esau, to become good? It was not chosen to become good, but having been
created good, it could be chosen.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">5.
"According to his election" would it mean that God, who foresees
everything, would have seen in advance the faith of Jacob before he was born?
So, although no one can be justified by his works, since one must be justified
to do good, yet as it is by faith that God justifies the nations (Gal. III, 8),
and that no one believes that by an act of his free will, God, foreseeing this
free and voluntary faith, would have chosen, in his prescience, a man who was
not yet born, in order to justify him. But if the election is made by
prescience and God has known beforehand the faith of Jacob; how will you prove
that he did not elect him for his works? If, because they had not yet been
born, they had done neither good nor bad, they did not believe either one or
the other. "But prescience predicted that one would believe?" She
could also predict that he would act; and if it is said that God elected him in
anticipation of his future faith, another may claim that God elected him rather
because of his future works than he foresaw. How then does the Apostle show
that it is not because of the works that it was said: "The eldest will
serve under the youngest? If it was because children were not yet born, he
could not speak of faith rather than works, since faith and works are lacking
to those who are not born. He did not want to make it understood that the
youngest was elected and slaved enslaved, because of prescience. Because it is
to show that the election did not come from the works he said: "Before
they were born or they had done good or bad. Otherwise one might have objected:
But God knew what each of them had to do. - So, what is the origin of this
choice? if it is not the fruit of works, which did not exist, or men who were
not yet born; if it is not the result of faith, which did not exist any more:
where does it come from?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">6. Must it
be said that there was no choice, since there was no difference between them in
the maternal womb in terms of faith, works, or any merits? But the Apostle
says, "That the decree of God may stand firm according to his election.
And it is precisely because he used this word that we make ourselves the
question. Perhaps it could be read otherwise: the Apostle had not wanted to
make it heard that if it were said: "Not because of their works, but by
the will of the Caller, the elder will serve under the most young, "so
that the decree of God might remain firm according to his election; But in
quoting those children who were not born, who had done nothing, he would rather
have dismissed the idea of ​​any election, and these words: Because before they
were born or had they neither good nor evil, that the decree of God might
remain firm according to his election, "would mean, before they had done
good or evil, to thereby determine the election of him who did good; and as
there would have been no choice based on works, and proper to strengthen the
decree of God, it is not therefore because of their works, but by the will of
Him who calls, "it is to say of him who justifies the ungodly by his
grace, by calling him to faith, "that he was told: The eldest will serve
under. the youngest. The decree of God, therefore, does not remain firm after
the election, but the election according to the decree; that is to say, it is
not because God finds in men good works to fix his choice, that the decree of
justification subsists; but it is because the decree subsists to justify those
who have faith, that God meets works worthy of election for the kingdom of
heaven. Indeed, if there were no election, there would be no elected officials,
and the Apostle could not say, "Who will accuse them? elected of God (Rom.
VIII, 33.)? However, election does not precede justification; but the
justification, the election. Because no one is elected if he is already at a
distance from the one who is rejected. So I do not see that it has been
possible to say, other than by admitting prescience: "God has elected us
before the foundation of the world (Eph. I, 4.)." And here, when the Apostle
says, "Not because of their works, but by the will of him who calls, it
was said to him, 'The eldest will serve under the youngest; He does not mean to
speak of election founded on merits, which occur only after the sanctification
of grace, but from the liberality of the gift of God; so that no one will boast
of his works. "For it is the grace of God that saves us, and it does not
come from us, but from God, for it is a gift from God; nor works, that no one
may boast (Ib. II, 8, 9). "</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">7. But one
asks whether faith, at least, deserves the justification of man; or if the
mercy of God precedes the merits of faith, so that faith itself is counted
among the benefits of grace? Now, after saying, "No, because of their
works," the apostle does not add: because of faith, "he was told, The
elder will serve under the youngest; But by the will of the Caller. Because no
one believes, if he is not called. Now God calls in his mercy, and not in
consideration of faith or merit; because merits follow the vocation, rather than
precede it. For how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how
will they hear if no one preaches them (Rom. X, 14.)? If therefore the mercy of
God does not prevent by calling, no one can believe so as to obtain the
beginning of his justification, and to receive the faculty of doing good. So
grace precedes all merit. "So Christ died for the wicked (Rom. V, 6)."
It is therefore by the will of the Caller, and not by the merits of his works,
that the youngest has had the advantage of seeing his eldest serve under him; as
also what is written: "I loved Jacob" must be explained by the will
of God who calls and not by the good works of Jacob.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">9. So the
Apostle has foreseen the effect that these words might produce on the mind of
the listener or the reader, and he hastened to add, "What shall we say
then? Is there in God injustice? Not at all. And as to tell us how far
injustice is from God, he continues: "For he said to Moses, I will have
mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.
But is this a solution, or an aggravation of the difficulty? For here is the
crux of the question: If God has mercy on whom he has pity, if he shows mercy
to whom he has mercy, why has this mercy failed Esau, since through it he would
have become good like Jacob? Or the meaning of these words: "I will have
mercy on whom I will have pity, and I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy," would it be this one: he whose mercy God had to call him, he has
pity to make him believe; and he to whom he has mercy to bring him to believe,
will he have mercy on him, that is to say, he will make him merciful, to bring
him to do good? By this we would be warned that no one should boast or take
pride in the works of mercy, as if through them one could deserve God of
oneself; whereas one is merciful only by the gift of God, who has mercy on whom
he has mercy. And if anyone boasted of having merit this mercy by believing,
let him know that his faith is a gift of the One who shows his pity by
inspiring the faith to him whom he had pity on calling him, when he is still
unfaithful. For this is how the faithful is distinguished from the ungodly.
"Indeed, what have you received, and if you have received it, why do you
boast of it, as if you had not received it?" (I Cor. IV, 7)</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> </span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">10. Very
good. But why was this mercy denied to Esau? Why was he not called to receive
the faith, and having faith to become merciful, to do good? Would he not want
to? But if Jacob believed because he wanted, God did not give him faith? So he
got it from his will, and he got something he did not get? Could it be because
no one can believe without wanting it, not wanting it without being called; and
that no one can give the session, God gives the faith by calling, so that no
one can believe without a vocation, although no one believes in spite of
himself? "For how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? Or
how will they hear, if no one preaches them? Nobody therefore believes without
being; but one can be called without believing. "For many are called, but
few are chosen (Matt. XX, 16); And the elect are certainly those who have not
despised the one who called them, but followed him in believing, and believed,
no doubt, by the acquiescence of their will. What do the following words mean
then: "It does not depend on the one who wants, nor on the one who runs,
but on God who shows mercy (Luc, II, 14)? Could we not even want to be unless
we are called, and our will has no effect, if God does not help us to act? So
you have to want and run. For it is not in vain that it is said, "And
peace on earth to men of good will;" And again: "Run so as to arrive
(I Cor. IX, 24); Yet "it does not depend on the one who wants, nor on the
one who runs, but on the God who has mercy," that we obtain what we desire
and that we reach the goal to which we tend. Esau did not want to be good and
did not run; but if he had wished and if he had run, he would have arrived with
the help of God, who, in calling him, would have given him the faculty of
wanting and running, unless he was unfaithful to his vocation and,
consequently, reprobate. For something else is that God gives us to want,
something else that gives us what we want. Indeed, he wanted our will to be at
once to him and to us; to him, by vocation, to us, by obedience. As for what we
desire, he gives us alone, namely the power to do good and to live always
happy. Yet Esau, who was not yet born, could neither want that nor want it. Why
was it reproved from the womb? We are back to the same difficulties; already so
obscure by themselves, they are further aggravated by our continual
repetitions.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">12.
Moreover, if you pay close attention to these words: "It does not depend
therefore help the one who wants, nor the one who runs, but God who has
mercy," you will see that the Apostle has not only wanted to say that we
reach our goal only with the help of God; but that he also had the thought that
he expresses elsewhere in these terms: "Operate your salvation with fear
and trembling; for it is God who works in you to do it and do it, and shows his
good will. " by which he makes it sufficiently clear that it is by the
operation of God that good will is formed in us. Indeed if, saying; "It
does not depend on the one who wants, nor on the one who runs," (Phil.II,
12, 18) he had only wanted to make it understood that the will of man is not
enough, it jumps, to lead a nigh right and holy life, four times the mercy of
stake does not help him; One could say in the same way: it does not depend on
the God who shows mercy, but on the man who wills, since the mercy of a stake
is not enough, on its own, unless our will attaches to it. consent. Now it is
evident that our will is powerless, if God does not show mercy; "For I do
not know how one could say that the mercy of God is vain, if we do not want.
Basically, if God gives us mercy, we will; since our will itself is part of
this mercy: "For it is God who works in us to will it and to do it,
according to his good velvety. Indeed, assuming that we ask if good will is a
gift from God, it would be wonderful for someone to dare to deny it. As good
will does not precede the vocation, but the vocation the good will, it is right
to attribute this good will to God who calls; but we can not assign the vacation.
Thus these words, "It depends neither on the one who wants, nor on the one
who runs, but on God who has mercy," do not mean that we can not, without
the help of God, obtain what we desire, but rather that without his vocation we
can not even want.</span></p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">15. But
what good is this question, when the Apostle himself adds: "For the
Scripture says to Pharaoh, This is why I have raised you up, to make my power
burst out, and to make my name be it proclaimed by all the earth? "The
Apostle says this in evidence of what he has advanced above, that it does not
depend on the one who wants or the one who runs, but on God who has mercy. As
if someone had asked him: where do you get this doctrine from? He answers,
"The Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'This is why I raised you up, to make my
power burst out in you, and to proclaim my name by all the earth. Evidently he
shows that "it does not depend on the one who wants, nor on the one who
runs, but on God who shows mercy. From which he concludes: "So he has pity
on whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills:" two things he had not
stated above. If he said, "It does not depend on the one who wants, nor on
the one who runs, but on God who has mercy," he also did not say: it does
not depend on the one who does not want, who scornful, but of God who hardens.
By this he suggests that the two thoughts which he expresses below: "So he
has pity on whom he wills," agree with what he said above in the sense
that, on the part of God to harden is not to want mercy; it's not giving
something to make it worse, but not giving what could make it better. And if it
happens without any difference of merit, which will not immediately make the
objection that the Apostle does: "Certainly you will tell me: what is he
complaining about? Because who resists his will? Indeed, it is evident from
innumerable passages of Scripture that God often complains that men do not want
to believe and live well. So it is said of the faithful and those who do the
will of God that they walk without reproach (Luc, I, 6.), because the Scripture
does not complain about them. But what is he complaining about? says the
Apostle; for who resists his will, since he has pity on whom he wills and
hardens whom he wills? However, let us take things higher so that we may, with
the help of God, form our feeling.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">16. The
Apostle wrote earlier, "What shall we say then? Was there God of
injustice? Not at all. Let this point remain fixed and immutable in every soul
that piousness animates and is firm in its faith: there is no injustice in God.
Therefore one must believe very firmly, very firmly that if God has pity on
whom He wills and hardens whom He wills, that is to say, have pity on whom He
wills, and have no mercy on whom He wills. does not want, it is the effect of a
certain mysterious equity, inaccessible to the human weakness, which one can
also notice in the very things of this world and in the terrestrial contracts.
For if we did not find the traces and the stamp of a superior justice, our
infirmity would never dare to lift our eyes or aspire to penetrate into the
holy and very pure sanctuary of spiritual precepts. Happy are those who are
hungry and thirsty for justice, because they will be satisfied (Matt. V, 6.).
In this barren life, in our mortal condition, we would be dry even before we
were thirsty, if we were not refreshed by the breath, however slight, of
justice from above.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Thus, as
human society rests on a trade of mutual exchange, we give and receive what is
due and what is not due; who does not see that he who demands what is due to
him can not be accused of injustice, still less the one who hands him over to
whom he pleases him; and that it depends, not on the debtor, but on the
creditor? Now it is an imprint, or, as I said above, a vestige of the supreme
equity printed on human things. All men, and it is the Apostle who tells us:
"All die in Adam (I Cor. XV, 22.)," from whom original sin has passed
through all mankind; therefore all men form only one mass of sin, indebted for
a punishment to divine and sovereign justice: punishment that can be demanded
or surrender without shadow of injustice. The debtors, in their pride, judge
from whom it must be demanded, to whom it must be handed over, absolutely like
those workers hired to work in the vineyard who were indignantly indignant at
giving to others the wages they had received (Matt, XX, 11). Now it is this
insolent curiosity that the Apostle represses by saying: "O man, who are
you, to dispute with God?"</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">For it is
to dispute with God that to find it evil that he complains of sinners, as if he
were forcing someone to sin, when he is content not to grant to certain sinners
the grace of his justification; and that, for that, it is said of him that he
hardens them, not by exciting them to sin, but by not making them merciful. But
he does not show mercy to whom he deems fit to refuse it, for deeply mysterious
reasons quite inaccessible to human intelligence. For his judgments are
incomprehensible and his ways impenetrable (Rom. XI, 33). And he is right in
complaining of sinners, since he does not force them to sin. His purpose is
also to excite by those complaints those to whom he has mercy to maintain their
vocation, to groan in their hearts and to resort to his grace. He therefore
complains with justice, and even with mercy.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">17. Zion
is astonished that no one who resists his will rescues whoever he wants and
abandons whoever he wants; that he whom he rescues, and whom he abandons, are
of the same mass of sin; that, although both are indebted for the same penalty,
he demands it from the one and in fact shines over the other: if, I say, we are
astonished at this: "O man, Will we answer, "who are you to dispute
with God? I think that the word "man" has the same meaning here as in
this other passage: "Are not you men and do you not walk according to man?
For here under this name is meant the carnal and animal man, those to whom the
Apostle says: "I could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to
carnal men," and then: you could not do it now, and now you can not,
because you are still carnal (I Cor. III, 1, 4); And elsewhere: "The
animal man does not perceive what is of the Spirit of God (Ib. II ,14). So it
is to them that he says, "O man, who are you, to dispute with God? The
vase, he said to the potter, "Why did you do that to me? Does not the
potter have the power to make, from the same mass of clay, a vase of honor and
another of ignominy? These words prove sufficiently, it seems to me, that the
Apostle addresses the carnal man: for he indicates the matter of which the
first man was formed, and as according to the same Apostle, as I did note
above, "all die in Adam," all here also form the same mass of clay.
And although one is a vessel of honor and the other a vessel of ignominy, yet
the vessel of honor necessarily began to be carnal, before reaching the
spiritual age. The Corinthians were already vessels of honor and regenerated in
Christ; yet the Apostle speaks to them as to little children, even calls them
carnal and tells them; "I could not speak to you as spiritual men, but as
carnal men. Like little children in Christ Jesus, I watered you with milk, but
I did not give you food, because you could not yet; and now you can not,
because you are still carnal. Though he calls them carnal, yet he says that
they are regenerated in Christ, little children in Christ, and that they must
be watered with milk. By adding, "And even now you can not," he
suggests that if they make progress, they will be able to do it later, since
they are already spiritually regenerated and grace has begun to operate. them.
So they were destined to be vessels of honor, and yet it would have been right
to say to them: "O man, who are you to dispute with God? Now, if we could
speak this language to such men, much more can it be addressed to those who are
not yet regenerated, or who are vases of ignominy. Only let us consider it to
be incontestable, that there is no injustice in God. Whether he delivers the
debt or demands it, he whoever demands it can not accuse him of injustice; he
to whom he hands it over can not boast of his merits. One pays only what he
owes, and the other has only what he has received.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">18. But we
must try here, with the help of the Lord, to reconcile the truth of this text:
"You do not hate anything that you have done, (Sag. XI, 26)" with
this other text: "I loved Jacob and I hated Esau (Mal. I, 2, 3). If indeed
God hated Esau because he was a vessel of ignominy, and that it is the same
potter who makes the vessels of honor and the vases of ignominy, how will it be
true to say: "You do not hate anything you did? For God hated Esau, of
whom he himself made a vessel of ignominy. To solve this difficulty, it must be
understood that God is the author of all creatures. Now every creature of God
is good (I Tim. IV, 4); and every man a creature as a man, but not as a sinner.
God being therefore the creator of the body and soul of man, neither fun nor
the other is evil, and God hates neither: for he hates nothing of what he did.
But the soul wins over the body; and God on the soul and on the body. he who
created them both; and he hates in man only sin. The sin in man is a disorder,
an act of perversity; that is to say, a distance from the Creator who is more
spoken; and a reconciliation of the creature. It is not the man, but the
sinner, whom God hates in Esau. Thus it is said of the Lord, "He came to
his house, and his people did not receive him." And that he himself says
to the Jews, "If you do not listen, it is because you are not of
God." Why call them "his," and why say that they are not of God,
"if not because, in the first case, it is spoken of the men whom the Lord
himself had made, and that in the second he were the sinners he was taking
back? And yet these men and sinners were one; but they were men by the creation
of God, and sinners by their own will.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Now that
God loved Jacob, must we conclude that Jacob was not a sinner? No ; but God
loved in him the grace which he granted, and not the sin which he effaced. For
Christ died for the wicked; not so that they remain impious, but so that,
justified by their impiety, they become believers in the one who justifies the
impious; 4 for God hates ungodliness. Thus he punishes it in some by damnation,
he destroys it in others by justification, as he finds it good in his
impenetrable judgments. And though, impious people whom he does not justify, he
makes vases of ignominy, yet he does not hate their work in them. No doubt, as
impious, they are worthy of execration; but as vases they have utility; That of
turning in favor of the vases of honor, by their just punishments. God does not
hate them either as men or as vases, that is to say, he does not hate in them
either his creatures or the instruments of his Providence; because he did not
tie anything he did. But by making them the vessels of perdition, he makes them
also means of correction. He hates in them impiety, which is not his work. Thus
the judge hates robbery in the man, but not the condemnation of the robber at
the mines; for robbery is the theft of the thief, and condemnation that of the
judge. In the same way, God by making of the mass of the impious, the vases of
perdition, does not hate what he does, that is to say the work of his
Providence in the just punishment of the reprobate, which becomes an occasion
of salvation for those whose pity he has. So it was said to Pharaoh, "This
is why I have provoked you; it is to burst into you my power and that your name
may be announced in all the earth. This manifestation of the power of God, and
the preaching of his name by failing the earth, benefit those in whom the
vocation is efficacious, in that they slow down the fear and excite them to
straighten their ways.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">That is
why the Apostle says, "May God, wishing to manifest his anger and signal
his power, endure with extreme patience the vessels of anger that are to be
destroyed," implied: "Who are you? to challenge God? These last words
relating to those which preceded, the meaning would then be: if God, wishing to
manifest his anger, has endured vases of anger; who are you bridge challenging
with him? And not only, says the Apostle, it is by wishing to manifest his
anger, and to point out his power, which he has endured with extreme patience
with the vessels of anger; fit to be destroyed; But, he adds, "it is to
manifest the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy. What, indeed, is it
to the vessels of perdition that God patiently supports them to destroy them in
their time, and to use them as instruments of salvation for those whose pity he
has? But this is useful to those whom he proposes to save thus; so that, as it
is written, the righteous one should wash his hands in the blood of the sinner;
1 that is, purify himself from evil works by the fear of God; at the sight of
the punishment of sinners: So if God willing to manifest his anger; He has
borne vessels of anger, to inspire others with a salutary fear, and to manifest
the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared for
glory. In fact, this hardening of the ungodly shows two things: first, what
must be feared, so that each one may turn to God; then what actions of thanks
must be rendered to the divine mercy which shows, by the punishment of some,
what it accords to others. However, if the punishment it requires of some is
not right, by not demanding it from others it does not give them anything. But
as this punishment is just, and there is no iniquity in divine vengeance, who
will be able to render worthy deeds of thanks to him who delivers what he might
require, without anyone being able to say: have nothing?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

"And we, whom He has also called, not only of the Jews, but of the
Gentiles," that is to say, we, vessels of mercy which he has prepared for
the glory. He did not call all the Jews, kill among the Jews; not all the good
ones, but of the good ones. It is the same mass of sinners and impious ones,
born of Adam, and in which, except the grace of God, Jews and Gentiles are one.
If indeed the potter makes of the same mass, a vase of ignominy and a vase of
honor, it is clear that among the Jews as among the Gentiles, God makes vessels
of honor and vases of ignominy and that, therefore, all must be considered as
belonging to the same mass. St. Paul then quotes the testimonies of the
prophets relative to the two species of races, but by inverting the order; for
he said in the first place, "Of the Jews, and then of the Gentiles. But
now he cites firstly what regards the Gentiles, and then what concerns the
Jews. "As he says in Hosea, I will call him who is not my people, my
people; "Who is not beloved, beloved; and it shall come to pass in the
very place where they were told, Ye are not my people, they shall be called
children of the living God. This text applies to the Gentiles who had no place
designated for the sacrifices, as the Jews had Jerusalem. Now the apostles were
sent to the Gentiles, so that everyone could believe where he was, and wherever
they were, those to whom God gave the power to be made children of God, could
offer him a sacrifice of praise. The Apostle continues: "And Isaiah cries
against Israel. In order not to believe that all Israel has gone to ruin, he
tells us that here too there have been vessels of honor and vases of ignominy.
"The number of the children of Israel," says the prophet, "as
much as the sand of the sea, there will be a remnant of saved. All others are
vases destined for perdition. "For the Lord will fulfill and abbreviate
his word on the earth; That is to say, in his mercy he will save the believers
by the abbreviated means of faith, and not by means of the innumerable
practices of which the Jewish people were slavishly overwhelmed and crushed.
Did not the Lord, by grace, fulfill and abbreviate his word on earth, when he
said, "My yoke is sweet and my burden light (Matt. XI, 30)?" This is
what the Apostle also recalls a little lower: "Near you," said he,
"is the word in your mouth and in your heart; it is the word of faith that
we announce; because if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and if in
your heart you believe that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Because it is believed crier to be justified, and confess of mouth to be saved
(Rom. X, 8-10). This is the word that God has fulfilled and abridged on the
earth; it is by this accomplishment and by means of this abstract; that the
thief was justified, Attached to the cross by all its members, having no
freedom but the crier and the mouth, he thought of crier to be justified,
confessed of mouth to be saved, and deserved immediately of s to hear saying,
"Today you will be with me in paradise (Luc, XXIII, 43). No doubt if,
after having received grace, he had long lived on earth, good works would have
followed his conversion. But they did not precede it, so as to deserve this
grace, since it passed from brigandage to the cross and from the cross to
paradise.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
Apostle continues: "And as Isaiah had said before, If the Lord of hosts
had not given us an offspring, we would have become like Sodom and like
Gomorrah. Here we had a scion reserved for him and he returned to what he said
above: "There will be a remnant of saved. The others perished, as vases of
perdition, by a deserved punishment. And if all did not perish like the
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, they owed it not to their merits, but to the
grace of God who left offspring, to produce a new harvest in all the universe .
This is what the Apostle says a little lower: "So also, in this time also,
a remnant has been saved by the election of grace. But if it is by grace, it is
not by works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What happened? What
Israel sought, he did not find; but those who have been chosen have found it;
the others were blinded (Rom. XI, 5, 7.). The vessels of mercy have found, the
vessels of wrath have been blinded; and all, however, were of the same mass, as
in the multitude of the Gentiles.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">20. There
is in Scripture a passage which must be quoted for the subject we are dealing
with, and which marvelously confirms all that we have expounded. It is in the
book called by some Jesus Sirach, by the other Ecclesiastics; it reads,
"All men come from the mud, and Adam was made of earth. In the greatness
of his wisdom, the Lord has separated them and changed their ways. He blessed
and lifted up some of them, sanctified them, joined with them; he cursed and
humiliated some others, and he scattered them when they separated from him.
"Like the clay in the hand of the potter who shapes and shapes it as he
wishes, so all the ways of man are in the disposition of the Lord; thus the man
is in the hand of him who has done it and who will repay him according to his
judgment. Good is contrary to evil, life to death, and the sinner to the
righteous. Consider all the works of the Most High, they are thus two by two,
and one opposed to the other."</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">First,
praise is given to the wisdom of God: "In the greatness of his wisdom, the
Lord has separated them. And what did he separate them from, if not the
happiness of paradise? And he changed their ways, "that they may live as
subjects to death. Then all together formed only one mass, having sin for
origin and death for punishment, though all that is good is created and formed
by God. For all have the beauty of the body, and the union of their members is
so harmonic that the Apostle draws a comparison to recommend charity (I Cor.
XII, 12). All of them also have the vital spirit which animates the material
members, and all this human nature so wonderfully balanced by the domination of
the soul and the obedience of the body. But the carnal concupiscence, the
punishment of sin, having taken the upper hand, had confounded all the human
race into one and the same mass, the original task having invaded everything.
And yet we read, "He has blessed and brought up some of them; He
sanctified them and joined them; he cursed and humiliated some others, and he
scattered them when they separated from him. What comes back to this word of
the Apostle: "Does not the potter have the power to make, from the same
mass of clay, a vessel of honor and another of ignominy? The rest of the text
presents a similar idea: "Like the clay in the potter's hand, which shapes
and shapes it as it pleases, so all man's paths are in the disposition of the
Lord, so the man is in the hand of the one who did it. And as the Apostle adds,
"Is there in God injustice? This is what the other writer says: "He
will repay him according to his judgment. But since the reprobate are justly
punished, and their punishment is for the benefit of those to whom he has
mercy, pay attention to this: "Good is contrary to evil, life to death,
and the sinner to the righteous. Consider thus all the works of the Most High;
they are two by two, and one opposed to the other; Evidently so that the
contrast of the wicked should make them shine and enjoy the good ones. However,
this improvement being the effect of grace, as if to say, "There will be a
remnant of saved," the writer adds, in the very name of those who are
saved: "And I was aroused, the last , and I am like the one who gathers
clusters after the pickers. And how does he prove that he owes it to the mercy
of God, and not to his merits? I myself hoped, he said, beseeched the Lord,
and, like the one who harvested, I filled the press. Although it was last
aroused, however, as it is written that the last will be the first (Matt. XX,
16), the people gathered from the remnant of Israel, hoping for the blessing of
God, filled the press with a superabundant harvest, which has occurred
throughout the universe.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">21. The
purpose of the Apostle, as that of all those justified by whom the mysteries of
grace have been revealed to us, is therefore to bring the one who glorifies
himself to glory in the Lord (II Cor. X, 17.). Indeed, who will discuss with
the Lord when, from the same mass, he condemns one and justifies the other?
Free will can do a lot; it certainly exists; but what can he do with men sold
as slaves to sin? The flesh, "says the Apostle, covets against the spirit,
and the spirit against the flesh, so that you do not do what you want (Gal.
V,17). We are commanded to live well, offering ourselves as reward eternal
happiness; but who can live well and act well, if it is not justified by faith?
We are commanded to believe in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and
to do good through love; but who can believe without being called in any way,
that is, excited by some testimony? Who is the master to obtain the sign that
will enlighten his mind, and determine his will to believe? Who attaches heart
to what does not please him? Who has the faculty or to meet the object that can
charm him, or to be charmed when he meets him? So when we find pleasure in what
can move us towards God, it is a gift and an inspiration of grace, and not the
result of our will, our talent or the merit of our works; because it is he who
gives and distributes and the consent of the will, and the resources of the
talent, and the animated works of the fire of charity. We are commanded to ask
to receive, to seek to find, and to strike to be opened (Matt. VII, 7). But is
not our prayer sometimes lukewarm, or rather cold, almost nil, and even
absolutely nil, to the point where we do not even notice it to groan? For to
groan in such a case would be to pray again. What, then, do we see there,
except that he alone, who commands us to pray, to seek, to strike, may grant us
the power to do so? "It does not depend on the one who wants, nor on the
one who runs, but on God who shows mercy," since we can neither will nor
run, if he does not touch us and excites us himself.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">22. If
there is here any election, as this text seems to indicate: "A remnant has
been saved by the election of grace (Rom. XV, 5.):" that is to say,
election of those who must be justified, and not the election of those who are
justified, for the possession of eternal life, this election is so mysterious
that it escapes us completely within the same mass; or at least, if some
discover it, I confess on this point my helplessness. In fact, if my thought
allows itself to examine this question, I perceive only three reasons which may
determine the choice of those who must attain to the grace of salvation: a
genius above the vulgar, or a lesser culpability, or the two together; add, if
you wish, honest and useful knowledge. Consequently, whoever has contracted
only very slight defilements, (for who is absolutely innocent?) Will be endowed
with a brilliant and polite genius by the liberal arts culture, that one will
appear worthy of being chosen for justification. Well ! I have scarcely posited
this principle, that I see myself pitied by Him who chooses what is weak according
to the world, to confound what is strong, and what is foolish according to the
world to confound the wise (Rom. XI, 39) ; and looking up to him and all
shamed, I myself take pity on a great many men purer than some sinners and more
eloquent than some fishermen. Do not we see many of our faithful walk in the
ways of God, although, from the point of view of genius, they are far below, I
do not say some heretics, but even some actors? Do not we also see people of
both sexes living blamelessly in conjugal chastity, and yet tainted with heresy
or paganism, or, if they are in the true faith and in the true Church, so
lukewarm that we are astonished to see courtesans and histrions, suddenly
converted, surpassing them, not only in patience and moderation, but even in
faith, hope, charity? There remains, then, that the choice is determined by the
wills. But the will itself does not shake itself if it does not meet something
that is able to charm and attract the spirit; and this encounter is not in the
power of man. What did Saul want, if not to attack, to drag, to garrot, to kill
Christians? What will be furious, furious, blind! And yet, overcome by a single
word, and struck by the sight of an object capable of breaking his anger, of
changing and turning his mind and will towards faith, he suddenly becomes an
extraordinary persecutor more extraordinary, of the Gospel (Éccl. XXXIX, 19-26).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And yet,
what will we say? "Is there in God an injustice," because he makes
him pay for whom he pleases, and remits the debt to whomever he wishes; that he
demands only what is owed him, and gives only what belongs to him? "Is
there in God injustice? Far from there. However, why so treat one, and not the
other? "O man, who are you? If you are given your debt, you can
congratulate yourself; if you demand it, you can not complain. Only believe,
although we can not understand it, that He who created everything, mind and
body, did everything with many, weight and measure (3). But his judgments are
inexplicable and his ways impenetrable (1). Let's sing Alleluia, let's sing a
hymn and let's not say: Why this, or why? For all things were created in their
time (2).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

already embarked on the Exposition of the Letter to the Romans, as I did with
the Exposition of the Letter to the Galatians. But there would be many books of
that work, if the whole Letter had been finished; of them I only concluded one,
which is the commentary to the initial greeting, to the words: The grace and
peace of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you (Rm 1,7). It
happened, by the way, that I stopped trying to solve the very difficult
question -tangent to the words of our passage- about the sin against the Holy
Spirit, which is not forgiven in this world or in the other (Mt 12,32). But
then I gave up adding more volumes to expose the entire Charter, scared by the
size and difficulty of the company, diverting me to other easier jobs. It
turned out that the first book, already concluded, was left alone. I chose as a
title: Inchoate exposition of the Letter to the Romans.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I say
there that "grace is in the remission of sins and peace in reconciliation
with God" (Cf 8,11). Wherever I have made this statement, it should not be
taken as if peace itself and reconciliation did not enter into the general
concept of grace, but there would be a specific name of grace to designate the
remission of sins. It is like when we say «the Law», specifically, in relation
to the expression: The Law and the Prophets (Mt 22,40), wanting to include also
the Prophets. This book begins: "In the Letter that the Apostle Paul wrote
to the Romans."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In the
Letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, as can be deduced from its
content, the question arises: Are the Jews the only recipients of the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ, for having deserved them with their observance of the
Law? <span> </span></font><font size="3">Or are all the Gentiles, who
without merit of previous works, are the recipients of justification by faith
in Christ Jesus, bearing in mind that this faith did not come to them by being
already righteous, but, believing, they received justification and began to
live as righteous? What the Apostle really intends to demonstrate is that the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has come for all mankind. And he clarifies it by
saying that grace has precisely this name because it is not something that is
paid in justice like a debt contracted; No, it's a free gift. It turns out that
some of the believers, coming from Judaism, had begun to revolt against those
of the gentility, and especially against the apostle Paul, because he admitted
uncircumcised to the grace of the Gospel, without subjecting them to the bonds
of the old Law. he preached that they should believe in Christ, and that there
was no need to submit to the yoke of carnal circumcision. But he does so with
such a balance that the Jews are not tolerated by the pride of any merit in
observing the Law, nor do they allow the Gentiles, by the merit of their faith,
to become arrogant against the Jews for having accepted Christ, a whom the Jews
crucified. The same idea develops in another place, where it says that it is placed
as ambassador of the same Lord (Cf 2Co 5,20), cornerstone (Cf Eph. 2,20), which
unites both peoples, both Jews and Gentiles in Christ, through the bond of
grace. To each and every one of them takes away all possible arrogance, born of
its merits; He makes disciples of humility to others, so that they are capable

servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, segregated for the Gospel of
God. He immediately distinguishes in two words the dignity of the Church and
the decrepitude of the Synagogue. The Church receives this name because it has
been called. The Synagogue, on the other hand, makes reference to the
gregarious. Being summoned is proper to men; to be added makes more reference
to the animals: in fact the herd or flock is applied with more property to the
cattle. It is true that in many passages of Scripture the Church is called
"herd of God", "flock of God" and "fold of God".
However, when metaphorically men are called by the name of some cattle, it is
because they are still part of the ancient life. And it can be seen how these
men do not aspire to the enduring food of the truth, but rather content
themselves with the earthly bread of temporary promises. So, Paul, servant of
Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, a vocation that incorporated him into
the Church. But it was segregated to proclaim the Gospel of God. Where did it
come from, but from the flock of the Synagogue? If it is that the Greek meaning
of these words agrees fully with its Latin sense.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

without a doubt, endorses with the authority of the prophets the strength of
the Gospel of God, for whose service he tells us he was chosen. In this way he
makes a new recommendation to the pagans not to be proud, since the believers
in Christ, of whom he feels called to be a part, put them before the Jews, of
whom he claims to have been separated. Actually the prophets are part of the
Jewish people. And already they had once promised the Gospel, which brings
justification to those who believe in him. This is what he says: Segregated for
the Gospel of God, which had previously been promised by his prophets (Cf Eph.
2,20). There were also some prophets who did not come from God. In his writings
there are several expressions about Christ, which they had heard and then expressed
in their songs, as it is said, for example, of the Sibyl. I would not easily be
inclined to believe it, if I did not mention it the most illustrious poet in
the Roman language. Indeed, before speaking about the renewal of the world,
whose verses could very well be called a song to the kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ, this verse advances: The final age of the song of Cumas has arrived.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Everyone
knows that the Cumus Song is that of the Sibyl. The Apostle knew that these
testimonies were found about the truth in the writings of the Gentiles; he
expressed it explicitly speaking to the Athenians, as recorded in the Acts of
the Apostles (Rm 1,1-2). That is why he not only says: By his prophets, but he
adds: In the holy Scriptures, lest someone, seduced by certain glimpses of the
false prophets, fall into some kind of impiety. It is also his intention to
declare that the writings of the Gentiles are plagued by a superstitious
idolatry, not being able to qualify them as saints due to the fact that they
contain an allusion referring to Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

could also happen that someone had preference for a prophet of antiquity, alien
to the Jewish people, in whose writings there is no cult of idols, product of
the hand of man; because in what refers to the simulacra of his fantasies,
every mistake deceives his followers. Well, to prevent anyone from being led by
preferences of this kind, to find the name of Christ there, and qualify them as
holy Scriptures, excluding those divinely entrusted to the Hebrew people, it
seems very opportune that, After having said in the holy Scriptures, he added:
About his Son, born of the lineage of David according to the flesh (Rm 1,3).
David, we know, was king of the Jews. It was therefore fitting that the prophets
who proclaimed Christ should come from the same people in whom the one they
were announcing was going to be incarnated. It was necessary to meet those who,
in their impiety, only accept our Lord Jesus Christ in their humanity, assumed
by him, but do not recognize his divinity, which distinguishes him and
separates him from all creation. Thus the Jews thought, for whom Christ was
only David's son, oblivious to the dignity for which he is Lord of David
himself, being Son of God. That is why he argues in the Gospel, using the same
prophetic words, from David's mouth. He asks them, in effect, how his son can
be, being that David himself calls him Lord (Cf Mt 22,42-45). His answer should
be that he is his son according to the flesh, but as to his divinity he is Son
of God and Lord of David himself. The apostle Paul, who knew this well, comes
up against it trying to avoid the belief that Christ was only and exclusively a
man of flesh and blood. Hence, first say: for the Gospel of God, which had been
promised by his prophets in the Holy Scriptures about his Son, who became a man
of the lineage of David, and then adds: according to the flesh. By adding this
expression, according to the flesh, he saved his divine rank. Of this rank, not
only the lineage of David, but that of every creature, whether angelic or any
other, however high their excellence, is lacking. It is the very Word of God,
by means of which all things were created (Cf Jn 1,1). This Word became a man
of the lineage of David and dwelt among us (Cf Jn 1,14); but he did not change,
becoming flesh, but he clothed himself with flesh to manifest himself in the
proper way to carnal men. The Apostle distinguishes humanity well from
divinity, not only in these words: according to the flesh, but in those other
words: it was done. Because it was not made (or was made) in its being of the
Word of God, no: by it all things were made, and it is not possible for it to
be made together with all the others. Nor was it done before all of them, so
that all others, except her, could exist through her. Because if she, before
the others, was created, the other things created by her environment could not
be, nor could it be said that everything was done through her, if she was also
made. This is why the Apostle, speaking of "being made" referring to
Christ, adds: according to the flesh, to make it clear that inasmuch as it is
the Word of God, that is, Son of God, it was not created by God, but rather of
him was born.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>[1,4]</strong> Of
this same Christ, who according to the flesh was born of the lineage of David,
goes on to say that he was predestinated with power to be the Son of God; and
this not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit; but not any
spirit, but the sanctifying Spirit in the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection
emphasizes the power of the one who dies, and therefore says: Predestined with
power, according to the sanctifying Spirit, in the resurrection of the dead.
Later, sanctification brought the new life, which was initialed by the
resurrection of our Lord. This is what the Apostle refers to elsewhere: If you
have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is seated at
the right hand of God (Col 3,1). The order of the words could really be this:
to the expression: Sanctifying spirit not to add to it in the resurrection of
the dead, but: it was predestined; then the order of the sentence would be like
this: that it was predestined in the resurrection of the dead, leaving as a
clause the words: Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
sanctification. This order of phrase seems more accurate because it adapts
better to its meaning, since this is the son of David according to the weakness
of his flesh, and Son of God with the power of the sanctifying Spirit.
Therefore he was born of the lineage of David, that is, he is David's son in
his mortal body, so he also died. But he was predestined to be the Son of God -
and Lord of David himself - in the resurrection of the dead. The fact of having
died makes reference to being the son of David; on the other hand, his
resurrection from the dead refers to his divine filiation, being also Lord of
David himself. As in another passage the Apostle says: For although he died for
his weakness, he is still alive by the power of God (2Co 13,4). Thus his
weakness belongs to David, and his eternal life to the power of God. That is
why David, referring to him in the words already quoted, calls him Lord: The
Lord said to my Lord: sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your
feet (Ps. 109,1). Because he has risen from the dead, he is seated at the right
hand of the Father. David, inspired by the Spirit, to see the predestined to
sit at the right hand of the Father, in the resurrection of the dead, did not
have the audacity to call him his son, but his Lord. And for that reason, with
the same reason, the Apostle added: From Jesus Christ our Lord, after saying:
in the resurrection of the dead. As if he wanted to remind us why David
testifies that he is his Lord, rather than his son. . Paul does not say of him
that he was predestined in the resurrection "from among" the dead,
but he says in the resurrection of the dead. In effect, it is not by his own
resurrection that his divine filiation, with that highest dignity, is evident.
his own and exclusive, for which he is also the head of the Church, given that
the rest of the dead will also be resurrected. He was actually predestined to
be the Son of God with a certain primacy in the resurrection, since his
predestination was from the resurrection of all the dead, that is, he was
destined to rise above others and before others. The words Son of God, placed
behind it was predestined, are like the confirmation of such high dignity. Only
the Son of God could be predestined to this, since he is also the head of the
Church, and the same Apostle in another place calls him first-born from the
dead (Cf Col 1,18). It was convenient that the judge of the resurrected was the
one who had preceded them as a model. But not as a model of all the resurrected
ones, but as an example of those who have to resuscitate to live and reign
eternally: he is precisely their head, and they are their body. He was
predestined in the resurrection, from among all of them to be his prince, while
for the rest of the resurrected he will be not his prince, but his judge. It was
not predestined precisely in the resurrection of those dead whom he was to
condemn. By saying the Apostle who had been predestinated in the resurrection
of the dead, he wants to imply that he would advance in the resurrection of the
dead. But to those who preceded has been those who were to continue in the
possession of the celestial kingdom. That is why he does not say: He was
predestinated as the Son of God in the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ
our Lord, but says: In the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord.
As if to say: "Who has been predestined as the Son of God in the
resurrection of his dead," that is, of those who belong to him for eternal
life. As anticipating the question: "Of what dead?" Gives this answer:
"Of those of Jesus Christ our Lord." In the resurrection of the
remaining dead, it has not been predestined, it has not preceded them in the
glory of eternal life, since they will not follow it: the resurrection of the
wicked will be for the punishment. Thus, as the Only Begotten Son of God, and
firstborn from the dead, he was predestinated in the resurrection of the dead.
What dead people, but those of Jesus Christ, our Lord?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Through him, he continues, we have received the grace and the apostolic
ministry; the grace in common with all the faithful; the apostolic ministry
only with some. If he had only said that he received the apostolic ministry, he
would have been ungrateful to grace, for which his sins were forgiven, and he
would give the impression that the apostolic ministry had been given as a
reward for the merits of his previous conduct. That is why he focuses well on
this point, so that no one dares to affirm that he has been called to the
Gospel because of the merits of his previous life. Not even the Apostles
themselves, who, after the head, are the most eminent members of the body, were
properly capable of receiving the apostolic commission, without having previously
received, like all others, the grace that justifies and heals sinners. And he
continues: That among all the Gentiles there may be an obedience to the faith
for the glory of his name. To this end he says he has received the apostolic
ministry, so that obedience to faith may be obeyed for the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that is, for that all who desire salvation believe in Christ and
follow his name. This salvation has not only come to the Jews, as some of them
believed, which makes it clear when saying: Among all the Gentiles, of whom you
are also part, called by Jesus Christ (Rm 1,5-6). In other words: so that you
too belong to that Jesus Christ who is the salvation of all people, even though
you are not part of the number of the Jews, but of the rest of the heathen
peoples.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

What he has said so far is who is the author of the Letter, that is, Paul,
servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, chosen for the Gospel of God.
And as the question seemed spontaneous: What kind of gospel? He answered: He
who had been promised by his prophets in the holy Scriptures about his Son. And
again the question came: Who is this his Son? To which he answers: He who
became a man of the lineage of David according to the flesh, predestined to be
the Son of God with power, according to the sanctifying Spirit, in the
resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord. Again another supposed
question: And you, how do you belong? He answers: By means of which we have
received the grace and the apostolic ministry, so that among all the Gentiles
there is an obedience to the faith for the glory of his name. And as if he were
again asked: What is the reason you are writing to us ?, he answers: Among
those who are also you, called by Jesus Christ. Then, and according to the
epistolary style, he mentions the recipients: To all beloved by God, who are in
Rome, saints by vocation. Here too he emphasizes the goodness of God over his
own merits. It does not say: To those who love God, but: To those loved by God.
He loved us first, before all merit, so that we, the beloved ones, loved Him (Cf
1Jn 4,19). They reaffirm the words that follow: Saints by vocation. And
although someone attributes himself to obey the one who calls him, no one can
be attributed to having been called. Saints by vocation should not be
understood as being called because they are already saints, but they have
become saints because they have been called.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

end, as usual, the heading of a letter, only the greeting remains, as a wish of
health to the addressees. Instead of him, and by greeting, he says: Grace and
peace to you, from our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. For not all grace
comes from God. The evil judges, for example, favor some people with their
grace, seduced by greed or cowed by fear. Nor does all peace come from God or
come from him. The Lord himself makes distinction, when he says: My peace I
give you, adding, moreover, that he does not give them the same peace that this
world gives (Cf Jn 14,27). It is, therefore, of the grace that is born of God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, through which the forgiveness of sins
comes to us, that made us enemies of God; and peace is the fruit of
reconciliation with God. When by grace our sins have been forgiven and our
enmity has disappeared, there is nothing left but to adhere in peace to God,
from whom only sin separated us. This is what the prophet says: He does not
cover his ears to avoid hearing; what happens is that your sins put distance
between God and you (Is 59,1-2). When they have already been forgiven by faith
in our Lord Jesus Christ, without separation, then peace will come.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Perhaps someone wonders how God's justice can be understood as a judge, even
though he grants his grace by forgiving sins. In God this is totally just; Yes,
because it is truly just that, when the fear of punishment has not yet clearly
appeared, those who are already repentant of their sins, are mercifully
separated from those who are stubbornly looking for excuses to continue
sinning, with no intention of repenting or correcting themselves. It would be
unjust, on the other hand, for the latter to suffer the same fate in punishment
as those who did not despise the invitation of God, and, aware of being
sinners, were disgusted with themselves, to the point of hating their own sins
as God. he hates them The doctrine, in short, of justice for man, is summed up
in this: to love in himself only what there is of God, and to hate what is
proper to man; not to approve their own sins, and in them not to blame anyone
but themselves; or to think that it is enough for him to disagree with his
sins, if he does not try to avoid them in the future with careful vigilance;
that he will not think that his own resources are enough to avoid them, but
that he should seek divine help. It is, therefore, just that God forgives them,
whatever their sins committed in the past life; and it would be a great
injustice to confuse them and equate them with those who have not repented.
Therefore, not to forgive some is God's justice, and to forgive others is the
grace of God. Thus, the grace of God is just, and justice gratifying, since in
the sinner grace precedes the merit of repentance: no one could repent of his
sins, if somehow God had not invited him with a call.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>[1,7]</strong> We
must not lose sight of the fact that the justice of God remains firm, and
although the repentant has been absolved of eternal and spiritual punishment,
no one is free of pain, and sometimes tortures, corporal - we well know how the
martyrs were tested in them - and finally death itself, which our human nature
deserved for sin. The fact that also the good and the pious pass through these
sufferings, we must believe it as a just judgment of God. This is what is
called in Sacred Scripture learning (discipline), which is not allowed to get
rid of any righteous. No one is exempt from that saying: God whom he loves
corrects him, and scourges all those he recognizes as children (Hb 12,6). The
same Job, who suffered so much, to shine as a paragon of strength and servant
of God, leaves us frequent evidence that their bodily torments are due to their
sins. The Apostle Peter also exhorts his brothers to endure the sufferings for
the name of Christ, and says: That none of you have to suffer for being a
murderer, a thief or cursing others, or for meddling in other people's affairs;
but if it is because he is a Christian, do not be ashamed of it; glorify God
for bearing this name. The time has come to begin the judgment for the house of
God. And if the beginning is for us, what will be the end of those who do not
believe in the Gospel of God? If the just is barely saved, what will the wicked
and the sinner stop in? (1P 4,15-18) Clearly we can see that the sufferings of
the righteous are due to a just judgment of God, a judgment that begins, he
says, by his house, so that we can deduce there how great will be the penalties
reserved for the ungodly. And Paul says to the Thessalonians: We ourselves
praise you in the churches of God, for your tenacity and your faith in the
persecutions that you are suffering, as a testimony of the just judgment of God
(2Ts 1,4-5). He fully agrees with what Peter says: The time has come to begin
the judgment for the house of God, and with the quote that he makes of the
prophet: if the just is barely saved, what will the wicked and the sinner stop?
(Pr 11,31) And I believe that the threats that God made to David through the
prophet Nathan come to mind here. Although he immediately repented and was
forgiven, all of them came to him, (Cf 2S 12) to record that the forgiveness
that was granted spiritually, was in view of the coming judgment of the
penalties that await those who at the present time refuse to correct yourself
Thus says Peter in another place: This is the reason why the Gospel was
proclaimed also to the dead: to receive the sentence in his flesh as men, and
to live according to God in his spirit (1P 4,6). I have said all this, to
clarify, according to my capacity and as far as the present passage of
Scripture allows, that when we speak of the justice and peace of God, human
beings will not believe that God can turn away from justice. In fact, when the
Lord promises peace, he says: I have told you this so that in me you may have
peace, although in the world you will have sufferings (Jn 16,33). When
tribulations and annoyances come because of sins, according to the justice of
God, they do not cause them to fall back into sin. On the contrary, to all
these, already good and just, and to those who dislike their own sins more than
any bodily suffering, those tribulations purify them completely of all stain.
The perfect peace, even the peace of the body, will become firm in due time, if
now our spirit maintains in a constant and immutable way the peace that the
Lord has deigned to grant us through faith.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

fact that the Apostle wishes peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus
Christ, without also naming the Holy Spirit, has no other reason, I believe,
but that the same gift of God we identify with the Holy Spirit What else is
grace and peace, but a gift from God? In no way can grace be given, which frees
us from our sins, nor peace, by which we reconcile ourselves with God, if it is
not in the Holy Spirit. Thus, in this greeting, the entire Trinity and its
immutable unity are revealed. This is mainly the reason why I believe that it
includes the same greeting in all the Letters that the churches, without
exception, certainly recognize as the Apostle Paul. The letter that he wrote to
the Hebrews is excepted, where it is said that he omitted this greeting on
purpose, to prevent the Jews, who cruelly criticized him, from being offended
at the sight of the name of Christ, or from reading the letter with hostile
spirit, or even bother to read it, even though he had written it looking at his
salvation. This is the reason why some have hesitated to include this Letter in
the canon of the Scriptures. Anyway, whatever it is of this question, the truth
is that in all of them he repeats the same greeting; only in the two written to
Timothy does he add mercy. It says: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father
and from Jesus Christ our Lord (1Tm 1,2; 2Tm 1,2). The more familiar, the more
lovingly he writes to Timothy, inserting this word, to clearly demonstrate that
the Holy Spirit is not given to us by the merits of our previous conduct, but
by the mercy of God with us. In this way we are granted the annulment of sins,
which separated us from God, and reconciliation, to unite ourselves with him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But also
the other Letters of the Apostles, commonly accepted by the Church, stop
mentioning the Trinity in its beginnings. Peter, for example, says: Grace and
peace to you in abundance; and immediately he adds: Blessed be God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ (1P 1,2-3). In grace and peace the Holy Spirit means,
so that the mention of the Father and the Son suggests to our mind the Trinity.
The other one of Peter says thus: To you grace and peace multiply by the
knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord (2P 1,2). John, on the other
hand, I do not know why, he omitted to begin in this way, and yet he does not
omit mentioning the Trinity, replacing grace and peace with the word
"communion": What we have seen, he says, we announce to you, so that
you too may be in communion with us, and our communion with the Father and his
Son, Jesus Christ. In his second Letter he agrees with the words of Paul to
Timothy: May grace, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from his Son,
Jesus Christ, be with you (2Jn 1,3). However, at the beginning of the third
Letter, John does not mention the Trinity at all. And I think it's because of
its extreme brevity. Thus begins: The priest to dear Gayo, whom I love in truth
(3Jn 1,1). The term truth seems to me that it replaces Trinidad's. Judas, in his
Letter, after naming the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, puts three words to
imply the Holy Spirit, that is, the gift of God. It begins like this: Judas,
servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to the beloved of God the Father,
and kept and called to Jesus Christ: may mercy, peace and charity reach you in
their fullness. Grace and peace can not be conceived without mercy and charity
(Judas 1,1-2). James, on the other hand, formulates in his Letter the customary
exordium: James, servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
tribes that are in the dispersion, health (St 1,1). I think he mentions health
or salvation, bearing in mind that it is not given except for a gift from God,
which includes grace and peace. Before health appoints God and our Lord Jesus
Christ, but since no grace or peace can save men, but those that come from God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, he probably uses the term health to
designate, I believe, the Trinity, the same thing that John uses truth in his
third Letter.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

said to each other: "Cheers!", One of them asked the one who knew
both Latin and Punic, what was the Punic equivalent of the Latin word salus
[health]. He answered that in Punic he says tria [three, in Latin]. Then, all
content, knowing that our health is the Trinity, it seemed to him that this
coincidence was not coincidental in the sound of the two languages, but it was
a hidden design of Divine Providence that by saying salus in Latin, the Punic
understood three [the Trinity], and vice versa, when the Punic, in their language,
say tria, the Latins understand salvation. And the Canaanite woman, that is,
Punic, came from the region of Tire and Sidon, which according to the Gospel
represents to the pagans, begs for health for his daughter. And the Lord
answers: It is not right to throw the children's bread to the dogs (Mt 15,26).
She, without denying that serious sin that was thrown in her face, and as
wanting to reach, with the confession of her sins, health for her daughter, and
also, the new life for her, she replies: That's right, Lord, but also dogs eat
the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters (Mt 15,27). When that
Canaanite woman said tria, she meant "salvation, health." And if we
ask our peasants what they are, they reply in Punic that "Cananos",
omitting a letter, as is their custom. But what else do they mean, but are they
"Canaanites"? When the woman asked for health and salvation, what she
really asked for was the Trinity: the language of Rome - whose word
"health" to the Punic people sounds like "Trinity" - at the
time of the coming of the Lord it was the head of gentility. We already said
that the Canaanite woman represented in her person the gentility. And when the
Lord calls bread to the same thing that the woman asked for, what else is she
referring to, rather than to the Trinity? In fact, in another passage he
clearly teaches us how the Trinity should be understood in the three loaves.
But this consonance of words, whether by chance or as a result of research,
should not be universally accepted at all costs. No: there is a limit marked by
these two coordinates: that the exegete does not cross the line, and that the
good spirit of the listener accepts it.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

evident, therefore, that if the Apostle tries to evoke the whole Trinity in
terms of "grace and peace," including, as it were, the Holy Spirit,
it must be taken into account with all the attention of our soul. , and accept
it with deep pity. And this to the point that everyone who loses hope, or mocks
or despises this announcement of grace, that erases our sins, and of peace,
that brings us reconciliation with God, refusing to repent of their sins , and
deciding to remain until the end in his impious and poisonous, although
pleasant, attractive, this one sins against the Holy Spirit. We should not,
therefore, turn a deaf ear to the word of the Lord, when it says that man will
be forgiven for every word uttered against the Son of man; but if he utters a
word against the Holy Spirit, he will not be forgiven either in this world or
in the future, but will be eternally guilty of sin (Cf Mt 12,32). Let us
suppose an individual, ignorant of the Latin language, and who hears the phrase
"Holy Spirit". Start asking about the meaning of these syllables that
you have heard; and another, mocking him, with impious sarcasm responds
something different from the truth, for example something vile and disgusting,
to deceive him, as often happens with people of this ilk, who want to laugh at
someone. And the first, suppose, despises the name of "Holy Spirit"
for his ignorance of such words, throwing, even, some expletive against him. I
do not think there is anyone so thoughtless and inconsiderate that he blames
this man for any crime against religion. And vice versa, if this same one, even
if the name is hidden from him, but coming to know the reality with words
within his reach, profess insults of word or deed against such a high sanctity,
he will be considered guilty. According to this, if someone, after hearing
"Holy Spirit", thinks that it has a different meaning, and throws a
word against this reality thought by him, it is evident, I believe, that he
does not sin to the point of considering it as a sin against him. Holy Spirit.
Likewise, if one were to ask the question of what the Holy Spirit is, and an
ignorant person tells him that he is the Son of God, through whom everything
was done, and that in due time he was born of the Virgin, who was killed by the
Jews and resurrected; but he, after hearing it, refuses to believe it or laughs
at all this, he should not be judged as if he had blasphemed against the Holy
Spirit, but against the Son of God or the Son of man, as he deigned to be
called and be it really. It must be attended not to what the words, said to an
ignorant, meant, but to what he thought was in his mind. Against what he was in
his curses, was against what was in his imagination, after what had been
explained. Call it what you want, what matters here is whether reality itself
sought to venerate, deny or vituperate. Because in this same way, if one asks
who Jesus Christ is, and someone answers that it is not the Son of God, but the
Holy Spirit, and, after hearing it, begins to blaspheme against him, his words
will not be considered against him. Son of God, but against the Holy Spirit.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

look lightly and without reflection at the phrase of Scripture: To the one who
says a word against the Holy Spirit, he will not be forgiven either in this
world or in the future (Mt 12,32), to whom could we assure that God grants him
forgiveness? of sins? There are, for example, the so-called pagans, who to this
day are completely forbidden, with weapons and even blood, our religion. They
curse, they proffer insults against her, and, with contempt and blasphemies,
deny everything that we affirm about the Trinity. They do not exclude, of
course, the Holy Spirit, in order to render veneration and be merciless with
the rest; on the contrary, they curse with all their impious folly of all that,
without exception, that we, with all care, affirm about the triune majesty of
God. It is not that they have a worthy concept of God the Father: because they
deny it totally, as some do, or others confess, yes, but with false imaginations,
and what they revere is not the Father, but the images of their fantasy. And in
regard to our doctrine about the Son of God or the Holy Spirit, they have much
preferred to laugh at it, as is their custom, than to worship Him in communion
with us. We, however, encourage you as much as possible to discover Christ, and
through him to God the Father; we try to convince them that they must be
military under the banner of the supreme and true Emperor, and we invite them
to embrace the faith, promising them the remission of all their previous sins.
When one of them becomes a Christian, we do not have the slightest doubt that
he is forgiven for even the blasphemies against the Holy Spirit, which he
uttered during the period of his sacrilegious superstitions. Stephen witnesses
to what extent the Jews opposed the Holy Spirit: they stoned him, filled as he
was with the Holy Spirit, since it was he who spoke what Stephen pronounced
against them. In that speech he said openly to the Jews: You always offer resistance
to the Holy Spirit (Acts 7,51). The apostle Paul was part of the number of Jews
who resisted the Holy Spirit, and who, precisely because they were full of him,
stoned Stephen, the true vessel filled with the Spirit. Paul was in the hands
of all when guarding his garments. Later, when he was already full of that same
Spirit, which had previously opposed a useless resistance, he throws himself in
the face, repentant as he was, ready to be stoned to defend the same truths
that had once made him He stoned whoever preached them. And the case of the
Samaritans? Do they not oppose the Holy Spirit, until they try to extinguish
totally the same gift of prophecy, which has been granted to us by the Holy
Spirit? Of course, the Lord himself gives testimony of his salvation, when in
the episode of the ten clean lepers, only one, precisely Samaritan, returned to
give thanks (Cf Lc 17,15-16). And the same in the passage of the woman, with
whom she was speaking at the well at the time of the sixth, and also those who
by her then embraced the faith (Cf Jn 4,7; 4,42). After the Ascension of the
Lord, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, what was not the joy of the
saints, seeing how Samaria welcomed the Word of God! There is the case of Simon
Magus, whom Peter rebuked him for having a lousy concept of the Holy Spirit: he
believed it to be a merchandise for sale, which he could buy with money. Well,
not even he despaired of finding a place for forgiveness. In fact, he
admonished him with meekness so that he would repent. Let's look, ultimately,
at the authority and prestige of the Catholic Church, which by virtue of the
same gift of the Holy Spirit, is spread throughout the whole world as the
fruitful mother of all saints. What heretic or schismatic, if corrected, has
never cut off the thread of the hope of salvation? Who closed the doors of
access to the mercy of God? Do not you call them with tears to return to their
mother's breasts, which with angry pride left? And who is among the heretics or
their leaders, who has not opposed the Holy Spirit? Unless someone has such a
crazy sense, that those who speak a word are guilty for him, and not those who,
with their repeated behavior, offend the Holy Spirit. Who are fighting so
openly against the Holy Spirit as those who, with disputes full of pride, are
against the peace of the Church? But if it is about words, I ask to see if some
do not verbally offend the Holy Spirit, when they categorically deny the
existence of everything that properly distinguishes it, and that God is one, so
that God himself is sometimes called Father, other Son and other Holy Spirit.
There are those who recognize the existence of the Holy Spirit, but deny that
it is equal to the Son, or in any case that it is not God at all. There are
others who confess that in the Trinity there is only one and identical nature,
but their ideas about that divine nature are so impious, that they have it as
something changeable and corruptible; and in relation to the Holy Spirit, which
the Lord promised to send to his disciples, they have invented that it was not
passed fifty days after his resurrection, as the Acts of the Apostles (Cf Acts 2,1-4)
testify, but some three hundred years later and by means of I do not know what
an individual There are also those who deny the coming of the Holy Spirit,
which we maintain, but who chose some prophets in Phrygia, a long time later,
through whom he was speaking. And others eliminate their sacraments like a
breath, and, without thinking twice, baptize again those already baptized in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. But I will not
go through all the deviations one by one, since they are innumerable. What I do
assure you is that all of these, which I have just quoted, so as not to stretch
out, when they return to the Bride of Christ, and repent and condemn their
error and their impiety, there is no Catholic discipline that denies them peace
and gives them peace. close the bowels of mercy.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

may say that there is only blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, when it is
uttered by someone who already has the sins forgiven by baptism. But notice
that these too do not take away the possibility of repentance, by virtue of the
sanctity of the Church. It can be argued that he is denied forgiveness because,
after receiving the grace of faith and the sacraments of the faithful, it can
not be said that he sins through ignorance. But here there are two different
things: one is to say that there is no forgiveness for having sinned outside the
period of his ignorance, and another is to say that there is no forgiveness for
having professed a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Because if forgiveness is
deserved only when there has been ignorance, and ignorance is assumed only
before baptism, then there is no possibility of healing by repentance, not only
if the Holy Spirit is offended by word, after baptism, but also if the offense
is against the Son of man, and in no way if any other crime is contracted, be
it for fornication, homicide, or for any other ignominy or grave sin committed
after baptism. Those who maintain this are excluded from Catholic communion,
and with all certainty it can be said that the defenders of such cruelty can
not be partakers of divine mercy. On the other hand, if it is believed that the
sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness after receiving
baptism, it is to observe first of all that the Lord, in referring to such sin,
does not spare any time, but affirms in a manner universal: He who says a word against
the Holy Spirit will have no forgiveness in this world or in the future (Mt
12,32). Simon Magus, whom I recalled shortly before, had already received the
baptism, when he imagined the Holy Spirit submitted to the vilest of the
markets. And yet, Peter, after correcting him, advised him to repent. Now, what
shall we do with those who received baptism as adolescents or children, and
then did not have a careful education, living in the darkness of ignorance, and
as a result have led a totally depraved life, completely ignoring what the
doctrine Christian commands or forbids, promises or threatens, ignoring what
should be believed, expected and loved? Will we come to believe that because
they are baptized, their sins should not be considered as a consequence of ignorance?
Were not they dominated by a profound error in sinning, when their ignorance
was such, that they did not know, as they say, or where they had their heads?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

may say that sin is deliberate, when one knows the evil of the act and,
nevertheless, realizes it; But why is it that only the sin committed against
the Holy Spirit, and not that committed against the Lord Jesus Christ, is
irremissible? Let us suppose this dilemma: that to sin or utter a word against
the Holy Spirit is to knowingly sin, that is, that sins due to ignorance are
against the Son, and the deliberate ones are against the Holy Spirit. Now I
ask: Who does not know that it is bad, for example, to desecrate the chastity
of another woman? At least he does know that he would not tolerate it in his
own wife ... Who does not know that it is wrong to cheat others, or deceive
them with lies, or damage them with false testimonies, or set traps to rob
them, or even kill them? one, or, in short, everything that one does not want
to do to oneself, and that, if he finds out about someone who has committed it,
without hesitation he accuses him as guilty? Because if we come to say that
such aberrations have been committed out of ignorance, when will we come up
with a case in which men clearly knowingly sin? The consequence would be this:
if the sin against the Holy Spirit is to sin with deliberation, there is no
place for repentance for the sins that I have just quoted, since the Lord, to
the sin against the Holy Spirit, took away all hope of forgiveness. Now, the
Christian norm is contrary to this, and does not cease to call to amend his
life to all those who commit these sins; We need, therefore, to know what sin
is against the Holy Spirit, that sin deprived of all forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

not true that he deliberately sins, knowing the wickedness of sin, commits it,
even if he does not know God or his will? This is what the Letter to the
Hebrews also seems to say: To those of us who sin voluntarily, after receiving
the knowledge of the truth, we no longer have any sacrifice for sin (Hb 10,26).
It would not be entirely clear to have said only: To those who sin voluntarily;
hence he added: after receiving the knowledge of the truth, which comprises the
knowledge of God and of his will. This knowledge seems to coincide with that of
the sentence of the Lord: The servant who does not know what his master wants,
and has a behavior worthy of flogging, will receive few; Not so the servant who
knows what his master wants, and his behavior is worthy of flogging: he will
receive many lashes (Lc 12,47-48). As if by saying: he will receive few lashes,
he would have wanted to say: «With a slight correction he will achieve
forgiveness», while the other one of whom he said: will receive many lashes,
would be punished eternally, punishment promised to those who sin against the
Holy Spirit . He tells them that this sin can never be pardoned; that is, to
sin against the Holy Spirit would be to sin knowing what God's will is. If this
is the case, it will be necessary to reflect and clarify first of all when this
knowledge of God's will is given. There are some who, even before receiving the
sacrament of baptism, have come to this knowledge. The centurion Cornelius, for
example, knew the will of God under the teaching of the apostle Peter, even
before being baptized, and received the Holy Spirit with great manifestation of
signs that accompanied him. And it did not thereby delay at all, as despising
them, the reception of such sacraments; on the contrary, he was baptized with
much more conviction, so that those sacred signs, whose reality he already
possessed in himself, would lead him to complete the knowledge of the truth (Cf
Acts 10). On the other hand, there are many who, even after receiving baptism,
do not care about knowing the will of God. Therefore, of all who sin before
their baptism, knowing the will of God, we can not say or suspect in any way
that they will not forgive all their sins as they approach the baptismal font.
To this is added that the believers are taught, as a summary of the divine
will, the love of God and neighbor, telling them that in these two precepts the
whole Law and the Prophets are contained (Cf Mt 22,37-44). But the love that
the Lord inculcates towards our neighbor, that is, towards man, reaches to the
love of the enemy (Cf Mt 5,44). And we can see that many of those already
baptized confess all this as true, and even revere these precepts as coming
from the Lord. And yet, when the time comes to suffer some attack from the
enemy, we must see how they ignite in desires of hatred and revenge! They are
not able to appease themselves even by reciting the passage of the Gospel. And
from this class of baptized, the churches are full! That is why there are men
of deep spiritual life who constantly admonish them, teaching them again and
again the spirit of meekness, (Cf Ga 6,1) so that they are prepared to face
these temptations with courage, and prefer to reign with Christ in peace,
rather than rejoice defeat of the enemy. But all this work would not make
sense, if for such sins there was not a gap left of forgiveness, a hope of
healing with repentance. To the defenders of this way of thinking, do not think
to affirm that the patriarch David, a man chosen, tried and praised by God, was
ignorant of the will of God, when, overcome by the passion towards the other
woman, he sought the deception and the death of her husband. But he himself was
the first to recognize and condemn his crime, rather than the voice of the
prophet; but he was absolved of his sin for confessing it with humble
repentance. Yes, he received, it is true, severe punishments (Cf 2S 11-12), but
his example helps us to understand that we should not interpret as referring to
eternal damnation, but to a more rigorous formation, those words of the Lord:
He who knows the will of his Lord, he becomes worthy of lashes, he will receive
many (Lc 12,48).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

text to the Hebrews: There is no longer any sacrifice for sins (Hb 10,26),
those who study it carefully do not apply it to the sacrifice of the contrite
heart for repentance, but to the sacrifice that the Apostle has been talking
about in the context, which is the holocaust of the Lord in his passion, and
offered each for his sins, when consecrated by virtue of faith in that same
passion. It is then when the baptized participates in the Christian name of the
faithful. The Apostle wanted to mean that the one who sins after baptism, has
no possibility of recourse to him again to purify himself. This interpretation
does not close the possibility of reconciliation, but we must also recognize
that those who have not received baptism do not have the full knowledge of the
truth. In other words, everyone who has received the knowledge of the truth is
supposed to have also received the baptism. But it does not necessarily happen the
other way around, that is to say, that every baptized person is already in
possession of the truth, since some, with the passing of time, are progressing,
and others, on the other hand, are victims of a deplorable abandonment. In
spite of everything, the sacrifice of which we have been speaking, that is, the
holocaust of the Lord, which is also offered for each one, when baptism
receives the imprint of its name, can no longer be offered again, although the
baptized one renews in the sin. No, it is not possible to baptize those who
were baptized a second time, even though, after their baptism, they have fallen
into sin because of ignorance of the truth. Therefore, no one can be assured
that he already possesses the knowledge of the truth before baptism; but we do
know that the one who already received it does not have a second chance to
sacrifice for his sins; in other words, you can not re-baptize. But neither
those who, for lack of proper catechesis, ignore the truth, will believe it
possible to offer for them a sacrifice that was already offered-in the event
that they were already baptized. After baptism, and then received the mysteries
of truth, no one can be baptized again. Let us give an example: after affirming
that man is not quadruped, we can not conclude that all non-human living beings
must necessarily be quadruped. Of those who are already baptized, we say that
they are cured by penance, but not that they are remade again. The new man
emerges, as from his foundations, in baptism with conversion. When the
foundations are left, a building can be restored; but if one wanted to build
the foundations again, then the building would have to be completely
demolished. The converted Hebrews gave the impression of wanting to pass from
the priesthood of the New Testament, to the Old one again; that is why they are
told in the Letter addressed to them: Leaving, therefore, the elementary
teaching on Christ, let us look at what has already reached its consummation,
without returning to lay the foundations to repentance for dead works, to faith
in God, the doctrine of purification, the laying on of hands, the resurrection
of the dead and eternal judgment (Hb 6,1-2). All this was taught in baptism,
and the author refuses to repeat it in regard to the baptismal consecration of
the faithful. Another thing is in relation to the exposition of the Word of God
and doctrinal teaching: that will have to be repeated not once, but a thousand
times, according to the convenience of the subject matter.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

would be time to conclude already from what has been said, that the
unforgivable sin is not any that is committed consciously, but committed
consciously against the Holy Spirit. And on this point the question arises: Did
the Jews know that the Lord was acting moved by the Holy Spirit, when they
accused him of casting demons by the work of the prince of demons? (Cf Mt 9,34)
It is strange that they could recognize in him the presence of the Spirit Holy,
ignorant as they were that the Lord was the Son of God, sunk in that their
blindness, in which a part of Israel is submerged, until all the Gentiles enter
the faith (Rm 11,25). From this blindness, God willing, and with your help, we
will deal with it in due course. On the other hand, the discernment of spirits
is the one by which one distinguishes if a person is working the Holy Spirit or
another false spirit. Note that this discernment by the Holy Spirit is given to
the faithful at times, as witnessed by the same Apostle elsewhere (Cf 1Co 12,10).
How could the Jews, unbelieving as they were, deprived of this gift, discern if
the Lord was working moved by the Holy Spirit? In addition, they gave
themselves, for their just punishment, evident indications of malevolence, when
they bought false witnesses against them (Cf Mt 26,59-60), when they sent him
simulated interlocutors, to surprise him in his words (Cf Mt 22,15-17). And
then, when they heard about the amazing miracles that took place at the
resurrection, they tried to corrupt the guards so that they would spread false
news (Mt 28,11-13) and thus hide the truth. These and other signs, recorded in
the Gospel narrative, let us see how his intention was malignant and poisoned.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

not of the Holy Spirit; and this is not because they are bad, but because he
hates them; and he hates them because in his evil attitude, he opposes
precisely the personified Goodness. This is the one who considers himself
guilty of sin against the Holy Spirit. But now I say: well, suppose that one
was part of that group to whom the Lord threw in face this crime; but then he
wants to approach the faith of Christ, asking with tears for salvation, plunged
in the pain of repentance and having already won those hatreds - something that
could have happened in some of the group. I ask: Is there someone so obfuscated
in his error that he denies the convenience of admitting them to the baptism of
Christ, or that he is convinced that his admission was useless? It is true that
if someone, moved by antipathy, curses against the divine proceeding, because
his perversity is opposed to the good works of God, that is, to his gifts, this
one sins against the Holy Spirit, so it must be thought that He has hope of
forgiveness. And now let's see if Paul himself was not part of this number. He
says: I was once a blasphemer, a persecutor and an insolent; but I have
obtained mercy, because I acted with ignorance, when I was not yet a believer (1Tm
1,13). Did he stop committing this kind of sin, because he did not have that
hatred? Let us listen to what in another place it tells us: We were once also
foolish, unbelieving, straying, slaves of all sorts of passions and desires,
acting with malice and antipathy, detesting and hating each other (Tt 3,3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

see, then, that neither the pagans, nor the Hebrews, nor the heretics or
unchurched schismatics, are closed the doors of Christian baptism when they
have already rejected their past life and have converted to a better life. And
this even though they were enemies of the Christian religion and of the Church
of God, before their purification in the Christian sacraments, even though they
had opposed resistance to the Holy Spirit, with all the humiliations within
their reach. We also see how those who have been initiated in the knowledge of
the truth, until they reach the reception of the sacraments, but then have
fallen, and have opposed resistance to the Holy Spirit, and yet when they have
returned looking for its cure and the God's peace through repentance, they are
not denied the help of mercy. We see, finally, that in those whom the Lord
blamed for having blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, if some of them came to
reflect and went to seek refuge in the grace of God, they found their healing
without any doubt. Well, this being so, how will we define sin against the Holy
Spirit, who in the words of the Lord has no forgiveness in this life or in the
other? We can only affirm that it is the sin of contumacy in evil and in
perversity, accompanied by the rejection of hope in God's forgiveness. This
amounts to opposition to his grace and peace, words that have given rise to our
digression on this subject. And here we must note that the Jews themselves,
accused by the Lord of blasphemy, were also denied access to correction and
penance, as the words with which the Lord Himself reproved them: If the tree is
good, its fruit is good; if the tree is bad, its fruit is also bad (Mt 12,33).
And this I would never have told you, if because of that blasphemy it was no
longer possible for you to change your soul to good, producing fruits of good
works, or being able to produce them, yes, but in vain, since your sin was
unforgiving.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">When
the Lord, moved by the Spirit of God, expelled demons and healed other diseases
and bodily ailments, he did not intend anything else, but rather accepted his
words: "Repent, the kingdom of heaven is near" (Mt 3,2). It is true
that sins are forgiven in an invisible way. Well, Jesus, with visible miracles,
prepared the faith in that forgiveness, something that appears quite evident in
the episode of the paralytic. The first thing that the paralytic is offered is
the visible gift of his health, which is why he came to Jesus. But as the Son
of man had come to save the world, and not to judge him (Cf Jn 3,17), he said
to him: Your sins are forgiven (Mc 2,9). This raised a wave of criticism and
outrage among the Jews, suggesting that it was an arrogance to attribute such power.
He replies: What is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven, or say: Get up and
walk? For you know that the Son of man has the power to forgive sins, (he says
to the paralytic): I command you, get up, take your stretcher and go home (Mc
2,10-11). Both with this fact and with his words, he clearly showed us that
what he did in the bodies was to support the faith in the liberation of souls
for the forgiveness of sins. That is, that visible power made the invisible
power worthy of faith. Well, as he performed all those portents, moved by the
Spirit of God, how to bring grace and peace to men: the grace of the
forgiveness of sins, and peace, the fruit of reconciliation with God - of whom
we only away the sin-, when the Jews said that the demons threw with the power
of Beelzebub, he wanted to admonish them with mercy, so that they would not
utter blasphemous words against the Holy Spirit (Cf Mt 12,22-23), that is, that
they would not oppose the grace and peace of God, that the Lord had come to
bring, moved by the Holy Spirit. It is not that they had already committed the
sin that has no forgiveness in this world or in the future, no; but it
inculcated them not to despair of forgiveness, either by boasting of their own
sanctity, omitting, consequently, the repentance, or because, obstinately in
their sins, they would continue to act in that way, and resisting grace as such
and peace, thus breaking into blasphemous words against the Holy Spirit, who
was for whom the Lord made such signs with a view to giving us grace and peace.
These blasphemous words, which are spoken of here, should not be understood
literally as pronounced by the language, but everything that the heart
conceives and we then express it also with works. It is the same as God does
not confess those who do it only with the sound of the voice, but they do not
accompany the works. Of them it is written: They proclaim that they know God,
but deny it with their works (Tt 1,16). It follows easily from here that with
deeds one can affirm, as well as deny. The expression of the Apostle: No one
can say: Jesus is the Lord, if he is not moved by the Holy Spirit (1Co 12,3),
he can not be understood correctly, except with the language of the facts. No
one believes that those whom the Lord reproaches with words are saying: Why are
you saying to me, "Lord, Lord," and do not do what I say? (Lc 6,46)
And also: Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord. », Will enter the
kingdom of heaven (Mt 7,21). The same thing happens in relation to the word
spoken against the Holy Spirit, of which the Lord warns that he has no
forgiveness: we must understand it as an attitude of persistent contumacy in
sin, without hope in the grace and peace that comes from the Spirit . For just
as they deny the Lord with the facts, so they also affirm with their deeds that
they want to remain in their evil life and perverse conduct. And in fact they
do so, that is, persevere. With this scenario, who is going to miss him, or how
will he say that he does not understand Jesus Christ the Lord, when he called
the Jews, with those threats, to convert? He wanted to grant them grace and
peace, through faith in him. But if they persisted in offering resistance to
grace and peace, they were uttering words and blasphemies against the Holy
Spirit with that desperate and ungodly attitude by persevering obstinacy in their
sins. With such an attitude, arrogant and against God, with absence of humble
repentance and confession of their sins, who will be surprised, I say, that
there is no possibility of granting them forgiveness in this world or in the
future? Well, in this way we have just resolved, with the help of the Lord, a
weighty and difficult question, on the occasion of the theme of grace and
peace, which we receive from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

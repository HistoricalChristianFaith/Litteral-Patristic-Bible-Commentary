<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:1-2"></a>1 Corinthians 15:1-2</h2>
<p><em>Now I make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand; by which also you are saved: in what words I preached it unto you.</em> </p>
<p>Having finished the discourse of spiritual gifts, he passes to that which is of all most necessary, the subject of the resurrection. For in this too they were greatly unsound. And as in men's bodies, when the fever lays actual hold of their solid parts, I mean the nerves and the veins and the primary elements, the mischief becomes incurable unless it receive much attention; just so at that time also it was like to happen. Since to the very elements of godliness the mischief was proceeding. Wherefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> uses great earnestness. For not of morals was his discourse henceforth nor about one man's being a fornicator, another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a>, and another having his head covered; but about the very sum of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things. For touching the resurrection itself they were at variance. Because this being all our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hope</font></u></a>, against this point did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> make a vehement stand, and at one time he was wholly subverting it, at another his word was that it was <q>past already;</q> which also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> writing to Timothy called a gangrene, I mean, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked doctrine</font></u></a>, and those that brought it in he branded, saying, <q>Of whom is Hymenœus and Philetus, who concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of some.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 2:17-18</font></u></a></span> At one time then they said thus, but at another that the body rises not again but the purification of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is the resurrection.</p>
<p>But these things that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> persuaded them to say, not wishing to overturn the resurrection only, but also to show that all the things done for our sakes are a fable. For if they were persuaded that there is no resurrection of bodies, he would have gradually persuaded them that neither was Christ raised. And thereupon he would introduce also this in due course, that He had not come nor had done what He did. For such is the craft of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. Wherefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> calls it <q>cunning craftiness ,</q> because he does not straightway signify what he intends to effect, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of being detected, but dressing himself up in a mask of one kind, he fabricates arts of another kind: and like a crafty enemy attacking a city with walls, he secretly undermines it from below: so as thereby to be hardly guarded against and to succeed in his endeavors. Therefore such snares on his part being continually detected, and these his crafty ambushes hunted out by this admirable and mighty man, he said, <q>For we are not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of his devices.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 2:11</font></u></a></span> So also here he unfolds his whole guile and points out all his stratagems, and whatsoever he would fain effect, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> puts before us, with much exactness going over all. Yea, and therefore he put this head after the rest, both because it was extremely necessary and because it involves the whole of our condition.</p>
<p>And observe his consideration: how first having secured his own, he then proceeds even beyond in his discourse, and them that are without he does abundantly reduce to silence. Now he secures his own, not by reasonings, but by things which had already happened and which themselves had received and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> to have taken place: a thing which was most of all apt to shame them, and capable of laying hold on them. Since if they were unwilling to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> after this, it was no longer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> but themselves they would disbelieve: which thing was a censure on those who had once for all received it and changed their minds. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> then he begins also from hence, implying that he needs no other witnesses to prove his speaking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, but those very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who were deceived.</p>
<p>2. But that what I say may become clearer, we must needs in what follows attend to the very words. What then are these? <q>I make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you, brethren,</q> says he, <q>the gospel which I preached unto you.</q> Do you see with what modesty he commences? Do you see how from the beginning he points out that he is bringing in no new nor strange thing? For he who <q>makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a></q> that which was already <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> but afterwards had fallen into oblivion, <q>makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a></q> by recalling it into memory.</p>
<p>And when he called them <q>brethren,</q> even from hence he laid the foundation of no mean part of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of his assertions. For by no other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> became we <q>brethren,</q> but by the dispensation of Christ according to the flesh. And this is just the reason why he thus called them, at the same time soothing and courting them, and likewise reminding them of their innumerable blessings.</p>
<p>And what comes next again is demonstrative of the same. What then is this? <q>The gospel.</q> For the sum of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gospels</font></u></a> has its original hence, from God having become man and having been crucified and having risen again. This gospel also Gabriel preached to the Virgin, this also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> to the world, this also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> all of them.</p>
<p><q>Which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand. By which also you are saved, in what word I preached unto you; if you hold it fast, except ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in vain.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how he calls themselves to be witnesses of the things spoken? And he says not, <q>which you heard,</q> but, <q>which you received,</q> demanding it of them as a kind of deposit, and showing that not in word only, but also by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and signs and wonders they received it, and that they should hold it safe.</p>
<p>Next, because he was speaking of the things long past, he referred also to the present time, saying, <q>wherein also ye stand,</q> taking the vantage ground of them that disavowal might be out of their power, though they wished it never so much. And this is why at the beginning he said not, <q>I teach you,</q> but, 'I make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you' what has already been made manifest.</p>
<p>And how says he that they who were so tossed with waves <q>stand?</q> He feigns <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> to profit them; which also he does in the case of the Galatians, but not in like manner. For inasmuch as he could not in that case affect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, he frames his address in another way, saying, <q>I have confidence toward you in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord</font></u></a>, that you will be none otherwise minded.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal005.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 5:10</font></u></a></span> He said not, <q>that you were none otherwise minded,</q> because their fault was acknowledged and evident, but he answers for the future; and yet this too was uncertain; but it was to draw them to him more effectually. Here however he does feign <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, saying, <q>wherein also ye stand.</q></p>
<p>Then comes the advantage; <q>by which also you are saved, in what words I preached it unto you.</q> <q>So then, this present exposition is for doctrine clearness and interpretation. For the doctrine itself ye need not,</q> says he, <q>to learn, but to be reminded of it and corrected.</q> And these things he says, leaving them no room to plunge into recklessness once for all.</p>
<p>But what is, <q>in what word I preached it unto you?</q> After what manner did I say, says he, <q>that the resurrection takes place? For that there is a resurrection I would not say that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>: but you seek perhaps to obtain a clearer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of that saying. This then will I provide for you: for indeed I am well assured that you hold the doctrine.</q> Next, because he was directly affirming, <q>wherein also ye stand;</q> that he might not thereby make them more remiss, he alarms them again, saying, <q>If you hold it fast, except ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in vain;</q> intimating that the stroke is on the chief head, and the contest for no common things but in behalf of the whole of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. And for the present he says it with reserve, but as he goes on and waxes warm, he throws off the veil and proceeds to cry out , and say, <q>But if Christ has not been raised then is our preaching vain, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> also is vain: you are yet in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>:</q> but in the beginning not so: for thus it was expedient to proceed, gently and by degrees.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:3"></a>1 Corinthians 15:3</h2>
<p><q>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received.</q></p>
<p>Neither here does he say, <q>I said unto you,</q> nor, <q>I taught you,</q> but uses the same expression again, saying, <q>I delivered unto you that which also I received:</q> nor again here does he say, <q>I was taught,</q> but, <q>I received:</q> establishing these two things; first, that one ought to introduce nothing from one's self; next, that by demonstration from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> they were fully persuaded, not by bare words: and by degrees while he is rendering his argument credible, he refers the whole to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and signifies that nothing was of man in these doctrines.</p>
<p>But what is this, <q>For I delivered unto you first of all? </q>for that is his word. <q>In the beginning, not now.</q> And thus saying he brings the time for a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, and that it were the greatest disgrace for those who had so long time been persuaded now to change their minds: and not this only, but also that the doctrine is necessary. Wherefore also it was <q>delivered</q> among <q>the first,</q> and from the beginning straightway. And what did you so deliver? Tell me. But this he does not say straightway, but first, <q>I received.</q> And what did you receive? <q>That Christ died for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q>  He said not immediately that there is a resurrection of our bodies, yet this very thing in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> he does establish, but afar off and by other topics saying that <q>Christ died,</q> and laying before a kind of strong base and irrefragable foundation of the doctrine concerning the resurrection. For neither did he simply say that <q>Christ died;</q> although even this were sufficient to declare the resurrection, but with an addition, <q>Christ died for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>3. But first it is worth while to hear what those who are infected with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Manichæan</font></u></a> doctrines say here, who are both enemies to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> against their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. What then do these allege? By death here, they say, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> means nothing else than our being in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; and by resurrection, our being delivered from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Do you see how nothing is weaker than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>? And how it is taken by its own wings, and needs not the warfare from without, but by itself it is pierced through? Consider, for instance, these men, how they too have pierced themselves through by their own statements. Since if this be death, and Christ did not take a body, as you suppose, and yet died, He was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> according to you. For I indeed say that He took unto Himself a body and His death, I say, was that of the flesh; but thou denying this, will be compelled to affirm the other. But if He was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, how says He, <q>Which of you convinces Me of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>?</q> and <q>The prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh008.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 8:46</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">14:30</font></u></a></span> and again, <q>Thus it becomes Us to fulfill all righteousness?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:15</font></u></a></span> Nay, how did He at all die for sinners, if Himself were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? For he who dies for sinners ought himself to be without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:4"></a>1 Corinthians 15:4</h2>
<p>4.  <q>And that he was buried.</q></p>
<p>And this also confirms the former topics, for that which is buried is doubtless a body. And here he no longer adds, <q>according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>.</q> He had wherewithal, nevertheless he adds it not. For what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>? Either because the burial was evident unto all, both then and now, or because the expression, <q>according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>,</q> is set down of both in common. Wherefore then does he add, <q>according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>,</q> in this place, <q>and that He rose on the third day according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>,</q> and is not content with the former clause, so spoken in common? Because this also was to most men obscure: wherefore here again he brings in <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a></q> by inspiration, having so conceived this thought so wise and divine.</p>
<p>How is it then that he does the same in regard of His death ? Because in that case too, although the cross was evident unto all and in the sight of all He was stretched upon it; yet the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> was no longer equally so. The fact indeed of his death all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>, but that He suffered this for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of the world was no longer equally <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to the multitude. Wherefore he brings in the testimony from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>This however has been sufficiently <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> by what we have said. But where have the Scriptures said that He was buried, and on the third day shall rise again? By the type of Jonah which also Himself alleges, saying, <q>As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:40</font></u></a></span> By the bush in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04749a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">desert</font></u></a>. For even as that burned, yet was not consumed, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 3:2</font></u></a></span> so also that body died indeed, but was not holden of death continually. And the dragon also in Daniel shadows out this. For as the dragon having taken the food which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> gave, burst asunder in the midst; even so Hades having swallowed down that Body, was rent asunder, the Body of itself cutting asunder its womb and rising again.</p>
<p>Now if you desire to hear also in words those things which you have seen in types, listen to Isaiah, saying, <q>His life is taken from the earth,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa053.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 53:8-11</font></u></a></span> and, it pleases the Lord to cleanse Him from His wound...to show unto Him light: and David before him, <q>You will not leave My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to Hades, nor will You suffer Your Holy One to see corruption.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa015.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 16:10</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also sends you on to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, that you may learn that not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> nor at random were these things done. For how could they, when so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> are describing and proclaiming them beforehand? And no where does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> mean the death of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, when it makes mention of our Lord's death, but that of the body, and a burial and resurrection of the same kind.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:5"></a>1 Corinthians 15:5</h2>
<p>5. <q>And that He appeared to Cephas:</q> he names immediately the most credible of all. <q>Then to the twelve.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:6"></a>1 Corinthians 15:6</h2>
<p><q>Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:7"></a>1 Corinthians 15:7</h2>
<p><q>Then he appeared to James; then to all the Apostles.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:8"></a>1 Corinthians 15:8</h2>
<p><q>And last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared to me also.</q></p>
<p>Thus, since he had mentioned the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, he adds also that by the events, producing as witnesses of the resurrection, after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> and other faithful men. Whereas if he meant that other resurrection, the deliverance from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, it were idle for him to say, He appeared to such and such an one; for this is the argument of one who is establishing the resurrection of the body, not of one obscurely teaching deliverance from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Wherefore neither said he once for all, <q>He appeared,</q> although it were sufficient for him to do so, setting down the expression in common: but now both twice and thrice, and almost in each several case of them that had seen Him he employs it. For <q>He appeared,</q> says he, <q>to Cephas, He appeared to above five hundred brethren, He appeared to me also.</q> Yet surely the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> says the contrary, that He was seen of Mary first. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar016.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 16:9</font></u></a></span> But among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> He was seen of him first who did most of all long to see Him.</p>
<p>But of what twelve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> does he here speak ? For after He was received up, Matthias was taken into the number, not after the resurrection immediately. But it is likely that He appeared even after He was received up. At any rate, this our apostle himself after His ascension was both called, and saw Him. Therefore neither does he set down the time, but simply and without defining recounts the appearance. For indeed it is probable that many took place; wherefore also John said, <q>This third time He was manifested.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh021.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 21:14</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>Then He appeared to above five hundred brethren.</q> Some say that <q>above ,</q> is above from heaven; that is, <q>not walking upon earth, but above and overhead He appeared to them:</q> adding, that it was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> purpose to confirm, not the resurrection only, but also the ascension. Others say that the expression, <q>above five hundred,</q> means, <q>more than five hundred.</q></p>
<p><q>Of whom the greater part remain until now.</q> Thus, <q>though I relate events of old,</q> says he, <q>yet have I living witnesses.</q> <q>But some are fallen asleep.</q> He said not, <q>are dead,</q> but, <q>are fallen asleep,</q> by this expression also again confirming the resurrection. <q>After that, He was seen of James.</q> I suppose, His brother. For the Lord is said to have Himself ordained him and made him Bishop in Jerusalem first. <q>Then to all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>.</q> For there were also other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, as the seventy.</p>
<p><q>And last of all he appeared unto me also, as unto one born out of due time.</q> This is rather an expression of modesty than any thing else. For not because he was the least, therefore did he appear to him after the rest. Since even if He did call him last, yet he appeared more illustrious than many which were before him, yea rather than all. And the five hundred brethren too were not surely better than James, because He appeared to them before him.</p>
<p>Why did He not appear to all at the same time? That He might first sow the seeds of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. For he that saw Him first and was exactly and fully assured, told it unto the residue: then their report coming first placed the hearer in expectation of this great wonder, and made way before for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of sight. Therefore neither did He appear to all together, nor in the beginning to many, but to one alone first, and him the leader of the whole company and the most faithful: since indeed there was great need of a most faithful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to be first to receive this sight. For those who saw him after others had seen him, and heard it from them, had in their testimony what contributed in no small degree to their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and tended to prepare their mind beforehand; but he who was first counted worthy to see Him, had need, as I have said, of great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, not to be confounded by a sight so contrary to expectation. Therefore he appears to Peter first. For he that first confessed Him to be Christ was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> also counted worthy first to behold His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>. And not on this account alone does He appear to him first, but also because he had denied Him, more abundantly to comfort him and to signify that he is not despaired of, before the rest He vouchsafed him even this sight and to him first entrusted His sheep. Therefore also He appeared to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> first. Because this sex was made inferior, therefore both in His birth and in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a> this first tastes of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But after Peter, He appears also to each at intervals, and at one time to fewer, at another to more, hereby making them witnesses and teachers of each other, and rendering His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> trustworthy in all that they said.</p>
<p>6. <q>And last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared to me also.</q> What mean here his expressions of humility, or wherein are they seasonable? For if he wishes to show himself worthy of credit and to enrol himself among the witnesses of the resurrection, he is doing the contrary of what he wishes: since it were meet that he exalt himself and show that he was great, which in many places he does, the occasion calling for it. Well, the very reason why he here also speaks modestly is his being about to do this. Not straightway, however, but with his own peculiar good sense: in that having first spoken modestly and heaped up against himself many charges, he then magnifies the things concerning himself. What may the reason be? That, when he comes to utter that great and lofty expression concerning himself, <q>I labored more abundantly than all,</q> his discourse may be rendered more acceptable, both hereby, and by its being spoken as a consequence of what went before and not as a leading topic. Therefore also writing to Timothy, and intending to say great things concerning himself, he first sets down his charges against himself. For so all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, when speaking in high terms of others, speak out freely and with boldness: but he that is compelled to praise himself, and especially when he also calls himself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, is disconcerted and blushes. Therefore also this blessed man first declares his own misery, and then utters that lofty expression. This then he does, partly to abate the offensiveness of speaking about himself, and partly that he might hereby recommend to their belief what he had to say afterwards. For he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> states what things are discreditable to him and conceals none of them, such as that he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, that he laid waste the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, does hereby <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the things that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> to him also to be above suspicion.</p>
<p>And consider the exceeding greatness of his humility. For having said, <q>and last of all He appeared to me also,</q> he was not content with this: <q>For many that are last shall be first,</q> says He, <q>and the first last.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat020.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 20:16</font></u></a></span> Therefore he added, <q>as unto one born out of due time.</q> Neither did he stop here, but adds also his own judgment and with a reason, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:9"></a>1 Corinthians 15:9</h2>
<p><q>For I am the least of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, that am not meet to be called an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostle</font></u></a>, because I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church of God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>And he said not, of the twelve alone, but also of all the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>. And all these things he spoke, both as one speaking modestly and because he was really so disposed as I said, making arrangements also beforehand for what was intended to be spoken and rendering it more acceptable. For had he come forward and said, <q>You ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> me that Christ rose from the dead; for I saw Him and of all I am the most worthy of credit, inasmuch as I have labored more,</q> the expression might have offended the hearers: but now by first dwelling on the humiliating topics and those which involve accusation, he both took off what might be grating in such a narrative, and prepared the way for their belief in his testimony.</p>
<p>On this account therefore neither does he simply, as I said, declare himself to be the last and unworthy of the appellation of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostle</font></u></a>, but also states the reason, saying, <q>because I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> And yet all those things were forgiven, but nevertheless he himself never forgot them, desiring to signify the greatness of God's favor: wherefore also he goes on to say,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:10"></a>1 Corinthians 15:10</h2>
<p>7. <q>But by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God I am what I am.</q></p>
<p>Do you see again another excess of humility? In that the defects he imputes to himself, but of the good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> nothing; rather he refers all to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Next, lest he might hereby render his hearer supine, he says, <q>And His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> which was bestowed upon me was not found vain.</q> And this again with reserve: in that he said not, <q>I have displayed a diligence worthy of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>,</q> but, <q>it was not found vain.</q></p>
<p><q>But I labored more abundantly than they all.</q> He said not, <q>I was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>,</q> but, <q>I labored;</q> and when he had perils and deaths to speak of, by the name of labor he again abates his expression.</p>
<p>Then again practicing his wonted humility, this also he speedily passes by and refers the whole to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, saying, <q>Yet not I, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God which was with me.</q> What can be more admirable than such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? Who having in so many ways depressed himself and uttered but one lofty word, not even this does he call his own; on every side finding ways, both from the former things and from them that follow after, to contract this lofty expression, and that because it was of necessity that he came to it.</p>
<p>But consider how he abounds in the expressions of humility. For so, <q>to me last of all He appeared,</q> says he. Wherefore neither does he with himself mention any other, and says, <q>as of one born out of due time,</q> and that himself is <q>the least of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>,</q> and not even worthy of this appellation. And he was not content even with these, but that he might not seem in mere words to be humble-minded, he states both reasons and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a>: of his being <q>one born out of due time,</q> his seeing Jesus last; and of his being unworthy even of the name of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostle</font></u></a>, <q>his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuting</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> For he that is simply humble-minded does not this: but he that also sets down the reasons utters all from a contrite mind. Wherefore also he elsewhere makes mention of these same things, saying, <q>And I thank him that enabled me; even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, for that He counted me faithful, appointing the to his service, though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 1:12-13</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>But wherefore did he utter at all that same lofty expression, <q>I labored more abundantly than they?</q> He saw that the occasion compelled him. For had he not said this, had he only depreciated himself, how could he with boldness call himself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, and number himself with the rest, and say,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:11"></a>1 Corinthians 15:11</h2>
<p><q>Whether then it be I or they, so we preach.</q></p>
<p>For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> ought to be trustworthy, and a great man. But how he <q>labored more abundantly than they,</q> he indicated above, saying, <q>Have we no right to eat and to drink, as also the other Apostles?</q> And again, <q>to them that are without law as without law.</q> Thus, both where exactness was to be displayed, he overshot all: and where there was need to condescend, he displayed again the same great superiority.</p>
<p>But some cite his being sent to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and his overrunning the larger part of the world. Whence it is evident that he enjoyed more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. For if he labored more, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> was also more: but he enjoyed more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, because he displayed also more diligence. Do you see how by those particulars whereby he contends and strives to throw into shade the things concerning himself, he is shown to be first of all?</p>
<p>8. And these things when we hear, let us also make open show of our defects, but of our excellencies let us say nothing. Or if the opportunity force it upon us, let us speak of them with reserve and impute the whole to God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>: which accordingly the Apostle also does, ever and anon putting a bad mark upon his former life, but his after-state imputing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, that he might signify the mercy of God from every circumstance: from His having saved him such as he was and when saved making him again such as he is. Let none accordingly of those who are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> despair, let none of those in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> be confident, but let the one be exceeding fearful and the other forward. For neither shall any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a> man be able to abide in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, nor one that is diligent be weak to escape from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. And of both these the blessed David is an example, who after he slumbered a little, had a great downfall: and when he was pricked in his heart, again hastened up to his former height. Since in fact both are alike <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, both despair and slothfulness; the one quickly casting a man down from the very arch of the heavens; the other not suffering the fallen to rise again. Wherefore with respect to the one, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said, <q>Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co010.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 10:12</font></u></a></span> but unto the other, Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb004.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 4:7</font></u></a></span> and again, <q>Lift up the hands that hang down and the palsied knees.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb012.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 12:12</font></u></a></span> And him too that had committed fornication but repented, he therefore quickly refreshes, <q>that such an one might not be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co002.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 2:7</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Why then in regard of other griefs art you cast down, O man? Since if for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, where only grief is beneficial, excess works much mischief, much more for all other things. For wherefore do you grieve? That you have lost money? Nay, think of those that are not even filled with bread, and you shall very speedily obtain consolation. And in each of the things that are grievous to you mourn not the things that have happened, but for the disasters that have not happened give thanks. Had you money and did you lose it? Weep not for the loss, but give thanks for the time when you enjoyed it. Say like Job, <q>Have we received good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 2:10</font></u></a></span> And together with that use this argument also; that even if you lost your money, yet your body you have still sound and hast not with your poverty to grieve that it also is maimed. But has your body too endured some outrage? Yet is not this the bottom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> calamities, but in the middle of the cask you are as yet carried along. For many along with poverty and maiming, both wrestle with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> and wander in deserts: others again endure other things more grievous than these. For may it never be our lot to suffer all that it is possible for one to bear.</p>
<p>These things then ever considering, bear in mind them that suffer worse, and be vexed at none of those things: but when you sin, only then sigh, then weep; I forbid you not, nay I enjoin you rather; though even then with moderation, remembering that there is returning, there is reconciliation. But do you see others in luxury and yourself in poverty: and another in goodly robes, and in preeminence? Look not however on these things alone, but also on the miseries that arise out of these. And in your poverty too, consider not the beggary alone, but the pleasure also thence arising do thou take into account. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> has indeed a cheerful mask, but its inward parts are full of gloom; and poverty the reverse. And should you unfold each man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the poor you will see great security and freedom: but in that of the rich, confusions, disorders, tempests. And if you grieve, seeing him rich, he too is vexed much more than thou when he beholds one richer than himself. And as you fear him, even so does he another, and he has no advantage over you in this. But you are vexed to see him in office, because you are in a private station and one of the governed. Recollect however the day of his ceasing to hold office. And even before that day the tumults, the perils, the fatigues, the flatteries, the sleepless nights, and all the miseries.</p>
<p>9. And these things we say to those who have no mind for high morality: since if you know this, there are other and greater things whereby we may comfort you: but for the present we must use the coarser topics to argue with you. When therefore you see one that is rich, think of him that is richer than he, and you will see him in the same condition with yourself. And after him look also on him that is poorer than yourself, consider how many have gone to bed hungry, and have lost their patrimony, and live in a dungeon, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for death every day. For neither does poverty breed sadness, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> pleasure, but both the one and the other our own thoughts are wont to produce in us. And consider, beginning from beneath: the scavenger grieves and is vexed that he cannot be rid of this his business so wretched and esteemed so disgraceful: but if you rid him of this, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> him, with security, to have plenty of the necessaries of life, he will grieve again that he has not more than he wants: and if you grant him more, he will wish to double them again, and will therefore vex himself no less than before: and if you grant him twofold or threefold, he will be out of heart again because he has no part in the state: and if you provide him with this also, he will count himself wretched because he is not one of the highest officers of state. And when he has obtained this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, he will mourn that he is not a ruler; and when he shall be ruler, that it is not of a whole nation; and when of a whole nation, that it is not of many nations; and when of many nations, that it is not of all. When he becomes a deputy, he will vex himself again that he is not a king; and if a king, that he is not so alone; and if alone, that he is not also of barbarous nations; and if of barbarous nations, that he is not of the whole world even: and if of the whole world, why not likewise of another world? And so his course of thought going on without end does not suffer him ever to be pleased. Do you see, how even if from being mean and poor you should make a man a king, thou dost not remove his dejection, without first correcting his turn of thought, enamored as it is of having more?</p>
<p>Come, let me show you the contrary too, that even if from a higher station you should bring down to a lower one him that has consideration, you will not cast him into dejection and grief. And if you will, let us descend the same ladder, and do thou bring down the satrap from his throne and in supposition deprive him of that dignity. I say that he will not on this account vex himself, if he choose to bear in mind the things of which I have spoken. For he will not reckon up the things of which he has been deprived, but what he has still, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> arising from his office. But if you take away this also, he will reckon up them who are in private stations and have never ascended to such sway, and for consolation his riches will suffice him. And if you also cast him out again from this, he will look to them that have a moderate estate. And if you should take away even moderate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and should allow him to partake only of necessary food, he may think upon them that have not even this, but wrestle with incessant hunger and live in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>. And even if you should bring him into that prison-house, when he reflects on them that lie under incurable diseases and irremediable pains, he will see himself to be in much better circumstances. And as the scavenger before mentioned not even on being made a king will reap any cheerfulness, so neither will this man ever vex himself if he become a prisoner. It is not then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> that is the foundation of pleasure, nor poverty of sadness, but our own judgment, and the fact, that the eyes of our mind are not pure, nor are fixed anywhere and abide, but without limit flutter abroad. And as healthy bodies, if they be nourished with bread alone, are in good and vigorous condition: but those that are sickly, even if they enjoy a plentiful and varied diet, become so much the weaker; so also it is wont to happen in regard of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. The mean spirited, not even in a diadem and unspeakable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> can be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>: but the denying, even in bonds and fetters and poverty, will enjoy a pure pleasure.</p>
<p>10. These things then bearing in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, let us ever look to them that are beneath us. There is indeed, I grant, another consolation, but of a high strain in morality, and mounting above the grossness of the multitude. What is this? That <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> is naught, poverty is naught, disgrace is naught, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> is naught, but for a brief time and only in words do they differ from each other. And along with this there is another soothing topic also, greater than it; the consideration of the things to come, both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and good, the things which are really <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and really good, and the being comforted by them. But since many, as I said, stand aloof from these doctrines, therefore were we compelled to dwell on other topics, that in course we might lead on to them the receivers of what had been said before.</p>
<p>Let us then, taking all these things into account, by every means frame ourselves aright, and we shall never grieve at these unexpected things. For neither if we should see men rich in a picture, should we say they were to be envied, any more than on seeing poor men there depicted we should call them wretched and pitiable: although those are surely more abiding than they whom we reckon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>. Since one abides rich in the picture longer than in the nature itself of things. For the one often lasts, appearing such, even to a hundred years, but the other sometimes, not having had so much as a year to live at his ease in his possessions, has been suddenly stripped of all. Meditating then on all these things, let us from all quarters build up cheerfulness as an outwork against our irrational sorrow, that we may both pass the present life with pleasure, and obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and forever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p>Having exalted the Apostles and abased himself, then again having exalted himself above them that he might make out an equality: (for he did effect an equality, when he showed that he had advantages over them as well as they over him,) and having thereby <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> himself worthy of credit; neither so does he dismiss them, but again ranks himself with them, pointing out their concord in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Nevertheless he does it not so as that he should seem to have been tacked on to them, but as himself also to appear in the same rank. For so it was profitable for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.

Therefore he also now makes himself equal again, saying,</p>
<p><q>Whether then it be I or they, so we preach.</q> <q>From whomsoever,</q> says he, <q>ye choose to learn, learn; there is no difference between us.</q> And he said not, <q>if you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> me, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> them;</q> but while he makes himself worthy of credit and says that he is of himself sufficient, he affirms the same also of them by themselves. For the difference of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> took no effect, their authority being equal. And in the Epistle to the Galatians he does this, taking them with him, not as also standing in need of them, but saying indeed that even himself was sufficient: <q>For they who were of repute imparted nothing to me:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal002.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 2:6</font></u></a></span> nevertheless, even so I follow after agreement with them. <q>For they gave unto me,</q> says he, <q>their right hands.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal002.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 2:9</font></u></a></span> For if the credit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> were always to depend on others and to be confirmed by testimony from others, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> would hence have received <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> injury. It is not therefore to exalt himself that he does this, but fearing for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>. Wherefore also he here says, making himself equal, <q>Whether it be I or they, so we preach.</q></p>
<p>Well did he say, <q>we preach,</q> indicating his great boldness of speech. For we speak not secretly, nor in a corner, but we utter a voice clearer than a trumpet. And he said not, <q>we preached,</q> but, <q>even now 'so we preach.'</q> <q>And so ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> Here he said not, <q>ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>,</q> but, <q>ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> Because they were shaken in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, therefore he ran back to the former times, and proceeds to add the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> from themselves.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:12"></a>1 Corinthians 15:12</h2>
<p>2. <q>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</q></p>
<p>Do you see how excellently he reasons, and proves the resurrection from the fact of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> being raised, having first established the former in many ways? <q>For both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> spoke of it,</q> says he, <q>and the Lord Himself showed it by His appearing, and we preach, and you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>;</q> weaving thus his fourfold testimony; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the issue of events, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>; or rather a fivefold. For this very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> too itself implies the resurrection; viz. his dying for others' <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. If therefore this has been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>, it is evident that the other also follows, viz. that the other dead likewise are raised. And this is why, as concerning an admitted fact, he challenges and questions them, saying, <q>Now if Christ has been raised, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</q></p>
<p>Hereby also again abating the boldness of the gainsayers: in that he said not, <q>how say, ye,</q> but, <q>how say some among you.</q> And neither does he bring a charge against all nor declare openly the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> whom he accuses, in order not to make them more reckless: neither on the other hand does he conceal it wholly, that he may correct them. For this purpose accordingly, separating them from the multitude, he strips himself for the contest with them, by this both weakening and confounding them, and holding the rest in their conflicts with these firmer to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, nor suffering them to desert to those that were busy to destroy them: he being in fact prepared to adopt a vehement mode of speech.</p>
<p>Further, lest they should say, <q>this indeed is clear and evident unto all that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is raised, and none doubts it; this does not however necessarily imply the other also, to wit, the resurrection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>:</q>— for the one was both before proclaimed and came to pass, and was testified of by his appearing; the fact, namely, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> resurrection: but the other is yet in hope, i.e., our own part:— see what he does; from the other side again he makes it out: which is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of great power. Thus, <q>why do some say,</q> says he, <q>that there is no resurrection of the dead?</q> Of course then the former also in its turn is subverted by this, the fact, namely, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is raised. Wherefore also he adds, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:13"></a>1 Corinthians 15:13</h2>
<p><q>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</q></p>
<p>Do you see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> energy, and his spirit for the combat, so invincible? How not only from what is evident he demonstrates what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a>, but also from what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a>, endeavors to demonstrate to gainsayers the former evident proposition? Not because what had already taken place required demonstration, but that he might signify this to be equally worthy of belief with that.</p>
<p>3. <q>And what kind of consequence is this?</q> says one. <q>For if Christ be not raised, that then neither should others be raised, does follow: but that if others be not raised, neither should Christ be raised, what reason can there be in this?</q> Since then this does not appear to be very reasonable, see how he works it out wisely, scattering his seeds beforehand from the beginning, even from the very groundwork of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>: as, that <q>having died for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>,</q> He was raised; and that He is <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> of them that slept.</q> For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>— of what can He be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>, except of them that are raised? And how can He be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>, if they rise not of whom He is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>? How then are they not raised?</p>
<p>Again, if they be not raised, wherefore was Christ raised? Wherefore came He? Wherefore did He take upon Him flesh, if he were not about to raise flesh again? For He stood not in need of it Himself but for our sakes. But these things he afterwards set down as he goes on; for the present he says, <q>If the dead be not raised, neither has Christ been raised,</q> as though that were connected with this. For had He not intended to raise Himself, He would not have wrought that other work. Do you see by degrees the whole economy overthrown by those words of theirs and by their unbelief in the resurrection? But as yet he says nothing of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">incarnation</font></u></a>, but of the resurrection. For not His having become incarnate, but His having died, took away death; since while He had flesh, the tyranny of death still had dominion.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:14"></a>1 Corinthians 15:14</h2>
<p><q>And if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> also is vain.</q></p>
<p>Although what followed in due course would have been, <q>but if Christ be not risen, you fight against things evident, and against so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> of facts;</q> nevertheless he states what is much more fearful to them: <q>then is our preaching vain, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> also is vain.</q> For he wishes to shake thoroughly their mind: <q>we have lost all,</q> says he, <q>all is over, if He be not risen.</q> Do you see how great is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> of the œconomy? As thus: if after death He could not rise again, neither is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> loosed nor death taken away nor the curse removed. Yea, and not only have we preached in vain, but you also have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in vain.</p>
<p>4. And not hereby alone does he show the impiety of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doctrines, but he further contends earnestly against them, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:15"></a>1 Corinthians 15:15</h2>
<p><q>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we witnessed of Him that He raised up Christ; whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.</q></p>
<p>But if this be absurd, (for it is a charge against God and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumny</font></u></a>,) and He raised Him not, as you say, not only this, but other absurdities too will follow.</p>
<p>And again he establishes it all, and takes it up again, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:16"></a>1 Corinthians 15:16</h2>
<p><q>For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.</q></p>
<p>For had He not intended to do this, He would not have come into the world. And he names not this, but the end, to wit, His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>; through it drawing all things.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:17"></a>1 Corinthians 15:17</h2>
<p><q>And if Christ has not been raised, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is vain.</q></p>
<p>With whatever is clear and confessed, he keeps on surrounding the resurrection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, by means of the stronger point making even that which seems to be weak and doubtful, strong and clear.</p>
<p><q>You are yet in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q> For if He was not raised, neither did He die; and if He died not, neither did He take away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>: His death being the taking away of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. <q>For behold,</q> says one, <q>the Lamb of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, which takes away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> of the world.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh001.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 1:29</font></u></a></span> But how <q>takes away?</q> By His death. Wherefore also he called him a Lamb, as one slain. But if He rose not again, neither was He slain: and if He was not slain, neither was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> taken away: and if it was not taken away, you are in it: and if you are in it, we have preached in vain: and if we have preached in vain, you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in vain that you were reconciled. And besides, death remains <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a>, if He did not arise. For if He too was holden of death and loosed not its pains, how released He all others, being as yet Himself holden of it? Wherefore also he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:18"></a>1 Corinthians 15:18</h2>
<p><q>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</q></p>
<p><q>And why speak I of you,</q> says he, <q>when all those also are perished, who have done all and are no longer subject to the uncertainty of the future?</q> But by the expression, <q>in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>,</q> he means either <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>,</q> or <q>they who died for His sake, who endured many perils, many miseries, who walked in the narrow way. </q></p>
<p>Where are those foul-mouthed Manichees who say that by the resurrection here means the liberation from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> ? For these compact and continuous syllogisms, holding as they do also conversely, indicate nothing of what they say, but what we affirm. It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, <q>rising again</q> is spoken of one who has fallen: and this is why he keeps on explaining, and says not only that He was raised, but adds this also, <q>from the dead.</q> And the Corinthians too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> not of the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, but of the resurrection of bodies.</p>
<p>But what necessity is there at all, that except <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> be not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, neither should Christ Himself be so? Whereas, if He were not to raise men up, it were natural to say, <q>wherefore came He and took our flesh and rose again?</q> But on our supposition not so. Yea, and whether men <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> or do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, there is ever with God an impossibility of sinning, and what happens to us reaches not to Him, nor does one case answer to the other by way of conversion, as in the matter of the resurrection of the body. </p>

And if this be so, we shall enjoy nothing then at all: and if nothing then, in the present life is our recompense. <q>What then in this respect can be more wretched than we?</q> says he.</p>
<p>But these things he said, as well to confirm them in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, as to persuade them concerning that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> life, in order that they might not suppose that all our concerns end with the present world.

<p>Having signified how great mischiefs are bred from not believing the resurrection, he takes up the discourse again, and says, <q>But now has Christ been raised from the dead;</q> continually adding, <q>from the dead,</q> so as to stop the mouths of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>. <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> of them that slept.</q> But if their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>, then themselves also, must needs rise again. Whereas if he were speaking of the resurrection from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and none is without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>—for even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> nothing against myself, yet am I not hereby justified ;</q>— how shall there be any who rise again, according to you? Do you see that his discourse was of bodies? And that he might make it worthy of credit, he continually brings forward Christ who rose again in the flesh.</p>
<p>Next he also assigns a reason. For, as I said, when one asserts but does not state the reason, his discourse is not easily received by the multitude. What then is the reason?</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:21"></a>1 Corinthians 15:21</h2>
<p><q>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</q></p>
<p>But if by a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, doubtless by one having a body. And observe his thoughtfulness, how on another ground also he makes his argument inevitable. As thus: <q>he that is defeated,</q> says he, <q>must in his own person also renew the conflict, the nature which was cast down must itself also gain the victory. For so the reproach was wiped away.</q></p>
<p>But let us see what kind of death he is speaking of.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:22"></a>1 Corinthians 15:22</h2>
<p><q>For as in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q></p>
<p>What then? Tell me; did all die in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> the death of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> ? How then was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11088a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Noah</font></u></a> righteous in his generation? And how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>? And how Job? And how all the rest? And what, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>? Shall all be made alive in Christ? Where then are those who are led away into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> fire? Thus, if this be said of the body, the doctrine stands: but if of righteousness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, it does so no longer.</p>
<p>Further, lest, on hearing that the making alive is common to all, you should also suppose that sinners are saved, he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:23"></a>1 Corinthians 15:23</h2>
<p><q>But every man in his own order.</q></p>
<p>For do not, because you hear of a resurrection, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that all enjoy the same benefits. Since if in the punishment all will not suffer alike but the difference is great; much more where there are sinners and righteous men shall the separation be yet wider.</p>
<p><q>Christ the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>, then they that are Christ's;</q> i.e., the faithful and the approved.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:24"></a>1 Corinthians 15:24</h2>
<p><q>Then comes the end.</q></p>
<p>For when these shall have risen again, all things shall have an end, not as now when after Christ's resurrection things abide yet in suspense. Wherefore he added, <q>at His coming,</q> that you may learn that he is speaking of that time, <q>when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when He shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</q></p>
<p>6. Here, give heed to me carefully, and see that no part escape you of what I say. For our contest is with enemies : wherefore we first must practice the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> which also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> often does. Since in this way shall we find what they say most easy of detection. Let us ask them then first, what is the meaning of the saying, <q>When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, even the Father?</q> For if we take this just as it stands and not in a sense becoming Deity, He will not after this retain it. For he that has delivered up to another, ceases any longer to retain a thing himself. And not only will there be this absurdity, but that also the other person who receives it will be found not to be possessor of it before he has so received it. Therefore according to them, neither was the Father a King before, governing our affairs: nor will it seem that the Son after these things will be a King. How then, first of all, concerning the Father does the Son Himself say, <q>My Father works hitherto, and I work:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:17</font></u></a></span> and of Him Daniel, <q>That His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, which shall not pass away?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan007.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 7:14</font></u></a></span> Do you see how many absurdities are produced, and repugnant to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, when one takes the thing spoken after the manner of men?</p>
<p>But what <q>rule,</q> then does he here say, that Christ <q>puts down?</q> That of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>? Far from it. That of the faithful? Neither is it this. What rule then? That of the devils, concerning which he says, <q>Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 6:12</font></u></a></span> For now it is not as yet <q>put down</q> perfectly, they working in many places, but then shall they cease.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:25"></a>1 Corinthians 15:25</h2>
<p><q>For He must reign, till He has put all enemies under His feet.</q></p>
<p>Again from hence also another absurdity is produced, unless we take this also in a way becoming Deity. For the expression <q>until,</q> is one of end and limitation: but in reference to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, this does not exist.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:26"></a>1 Corinthians 15:26</h2>
<p><q>The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.</q></p>
<p>How the last? After all, after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, after all the other things. For so in the beginning also death came in last; the counsel of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> having come first, and our disobedience, and then death. Virtually then indeed it is even now abolished: but actually, at that time.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:27"></a>1 Corinthians 15:27</h2>
<p>7. <q>For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, All things are put in subjection, it is manifest that He is excepted who did subject all things unto Him.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:28"></a>1 Corinthians 15:28</h2>
<p><q>And when all things have been subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subjected unto Him that did subject all things unto Him.</q></p>
<p>And yet before he said not that it was the Father who <q>put things under Him,</q> but He Himself who <q>abolishes.</q> For <q>when He shall have abolished,</q> says he, <q>all rule and authority:</q> and again, <q>for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.</q> How then does he here say, <q>the Father?</q></p>
<p>And not only is there this apparent perplexity, but also that he is afraid with a very unaccountable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and uses a correction, saying, <q>He is excepted, who did subject all things unto Him,</q> as though some would suspect, whether the Father might Himself not be subject unto the Son; than which what can be more irrational? Nevertheless, he fears this.</p>
<p>How then is it? For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> there are many questions following one upon another. Well, give me then your earnest attention; since in fact it is necessary for us first to speak of the scope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, which one may find everywhere shining forth, and then to subjoin our solution: this being itself an ingredient in our solution.</p>
<p>What then is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and what is his custom? He speaks in one way when he discourses of the Godhead alone, and in another when he falls into the argument of the economy. Thus having once taken hold of our Lord's Flesh, he freely thereafter uses all the sayings that humiliate Him; without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> as though that were able to bear all such expressions. Let us see therefore here also, whether his discourse is of the simple Godhead, or whether in view of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">incarnation</font></u></a> he asserts of Him those things which he says: or rather let us first point out where he did this of which I have spoken. Where then did he this? Writing to the Philippians he says, <q>Who, being in the form of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but emptied Himself of no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a>, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, He humbled Himself, becoming <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a> even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore has God highly exalted Him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi002.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 2:6-9</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Do you see how when he was discoursing of the Godhead alone, he uttered those great things, that He <q>was in the form of God</q> and that He <q>was equal with</q> Him that begot Him, and to Him refers the whole? But when He showed Him to you made flesh, he lowered again the discourse. For except thou distinguish these things, there is great variance between the things spoken. Since, if He were <q>equal with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> how did He highly exalt one equal with Himself? If He were <q>in the form of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> how <q>gave</q> He Him <q>a name?</q> for he that gives, gives to one that has not, and he that exalts, exalts one that is before abased. He will be found then to be imperfect and in need, before He has received the <q>exaltation</q> and <q>the Name;</q> and many other absurd corollaries will hence follow. But if you should add the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">incarnation</font></u></a>, you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">err</font></u></a> in saying these things. These things then here also consider, and with this mind receive thou the expressions.</p>
<p>8. Now together with these we will state also other reasons why this pericope of Scripture was thus composed. But at present it is necessary to mention this: first, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> discourse was of the resurrection, a thing counted to be impossible and greatly disbelieved: next, he was writing to Corinthians among whom there were many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a> who mocked at such things always. For although in other things wrangling one with another, in this they all, as with one mouth, conspired, dogmatically declaring that there is no resurrection. Contending therefore for such a subject so disbelieved and ridiculed, both on account of the prejudice which had been formed, and on account of the difficulty of the thing; and wishing to demonstrate its possibility, he first effects this from the resurrection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. And having <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> it both from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, and from those who had seen, and from those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>: when he had obtained an admitted <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, he proves in what follows the resurrection of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> also. <q>For if the dead rise not,</q> says he, <q>neither has Christ been raised.</q></p>
<p>Further; having closely urged these converse arguments in the former verses, he tries it again in another way, calling Him the <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>,</q> and pointing to His <q>abolishing all rule and authority and power, and death last.</q> <q>How then should death be put down,</q> says he, <q>unless he first loose the bodies which he held?</q> Since then he had spoken great things of the Only-Begotten, that He <q>gives up the kingdom,</q> i.e., that He Himself brings these things to pass, and Himself is victor in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and <q>puts all things under His feet,</q> he adds, to correct the unbelief of the multitude, <q>for He must reign till He has put all His enemies under His feet.</q> Not as putting an end to the kingdom, did he use the expression <q>until,</q> but to render what was said worthy of credit, and induce them to be confident. For <q>do not,</q> says he, <q>because you have heard that He will abolish all rule, and authority and power,</q> to wit, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and the bands of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, (many as there are,) and the multitudes of unbelievers, and the tyranny of death, and all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>: do not thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> as though His strength was exhausted. For until He shall have done all these things, <q>He must reign;</q> not saying this, that after He has brought it to pass He does not reign; but establishing this other, that even if it be not now, undoubtedly it will be. For His kingdom is not cut off: yea, He rules and prevails and abides until He shall have set to right all things.</p>
<p>And this manner of speech one might find also in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>; as when it is said, <q>But the word of the Lord abides for ever;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa118.htm#verse89" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 119:89</font></u></a></span> and, <q>You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa101.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 102:27</font></u></a></span> Now these and such-like things the Prophet says, when he is telling of things which a long space of time must achieve and which must by all means come to pass; casting out the fearfulness of the duller sort of hearers.</p>
<p>But that the expression, <q>until,</q> spoken of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and <q>unto,</q> do not signify an end, hear what one says: <q>From everlasting unto everlasting You are God:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa089.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 90:2</font></u></a></span> and again, <q>I am, I am,</q> and <q>Even to your old age I am He.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa046.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 46:4</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> indeed does he set death last, that from the victory over the rest this also might be easily admitted by the unbeliever. For when He destroys the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> who brought in death, much more will He put an end to His work.</p>
<p>9. Since then he referred all to Him, the <q>abolishing rule and authority,</q> the perfecting of His kingdom, (I mean the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of the faithful, the peace of the world, the taking away of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, for this is to perfect His kingdom,) the putting an end to death; and he said not, <q>the Father by Him,</q> but, <q>Himself shall put down, and Himself shall put under His feet,</q> and he no where mentioned Him that begot Him; he was afraid afterward, lest on this account among some of the more irrational <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, either the Son might seem to be greater than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, or to be a certain distinct principle, unbegotten. And therefore, gently guarding himself, he qualifies the magnitude of his expressions, saying, <q>for He put all things in subjection under His feet,</q> again referring to the Father these high achievements; not as though the Son were without power. For how could He be, of whom he testified so great things before, and referred to Him all that was said? But it was for the reason which I mentioned, and that he might show all things to be common to Father and Son which were done in our behalf. For that Himself alone was sufficient to <q>put all things in subjection under Him,</q> hear again <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:21</font></u></a></span> <q>Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, according to the working whereby He is able even to subject all things unto Himself.</q></p>
<p>Then also he uses a correction, saying, <q>But when He says, all things are put in subjection, it is evident that He is excepted who did subject all things unto Him,</q> testifying even thence no small <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to the Only-Begotten. For if He were less and much inferior, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> would never have been entertained by him. Neither is he content with this, but also adds another thing, as follows. I say, lest any should doubtingly ask, <q>And what if the Father has not been 'put under Him?' this does not at all hinder the Son from being the more mighty;</q> fearing this impious supposition, because that expression was not sufficient to point out this also, he added, going very much beyond it, <q>But when all things have been subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subjected;</q> showing His great concord with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and that He is the principle of all other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things and the first Cause, who has begotten One so great in power and in achievements.</p>
<p>10. But if he said more than the subject-matter demanded, marvel not. For in imitation of his Master he does this: since He too purposing to show His concord with Him that begot Him, and that He has not come without His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, descends so far, I say not, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of concord demanded, but as the weakness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> present required. For He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a> to His Father for no other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> but this; and stating the reason He says, <q>that they may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that You have sent Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh011.htm#verse42" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 11:42</font></u></a></span> In imitation therefore of Him, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> here in his manner of speech goes beyond what was required; not that you might have any suspicion of a forced servitude, far from it; but that he might the more entirely cast out those impious doctrines. For so when he is minded to pull up any thing by the roots, he is wont to do it, and abundantly more with it. Thus too, for example, when he spoke of a believing wife and an unbelieving husband, companying with one another by the law of marriage, that the wife might not consider herself defiled by that intercourse and the embraces of the unbeliever, he said not, <q>the wife is not unclean,</q> nor, <q>she is no wise harmed by the unbeliever,</q> but, which was much more, <q>the unbeliever is even 'sanctified' by her,</q> not meaning to signify that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> was made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> through her, but by the very great strength of the expression anxious to remove her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.  So also here, his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> to take away that impious doctrine by a very strong utterance was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his expressing himself as he did. For as to suspect the Son of weakness is extreme impiety: (wherefore he corrects it, saying, <q>He shall put all enemies under His feet:</q>) so on the other hand is it more impious to consider the Father inferior to Him. Wherefore he takes it also away with exceeding force. And observe how he puts it. For he said not simply, <q>He is excepted which put all things under Him,</q> but, <q>it is manifest,</q> <q>for even if it be admitted,</q> says he, <q>nevertheless I make it sure. </q></p>
<p>And that you may learn that this is the reason of the things spoken, I would ask you this question: Does an additional <q>subjection</q> at that time befal the Son? And how can this be other than impious and unworthy of God? For the greatest subjection and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> is this, that He who is God took the form of a servant. How then will He be <q>subjected?</q> Do you see, that to take away the impious notion, he used this expression? And this too in a suitable though reserved sense? For he becomes a Son and a divine Person, so He obeys; not humanly, but as one acting freely and having all authority. Otherwise how is he co-enthroned? How, <q>as the Father raises up, even so He, whom He will?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:21</font></u></a></span> How are <q>all things that the Father has His,</q> and all that He has, the Father's? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 16:15</font></u></a></span> For these phrases indicate to us an authority exactly measured by that of Him that begot Him.</p>
<p>11. But what is this, <q>When He shall deliver up the kingdom?</q> The Scripture acknowledges two kingdoms of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the one by appropriation , the other by creation. Thus, He is King over all, both Greeks and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> and devils and His adversaries, in respect of His creation: but He is King of the faithful and willing and subject, in respect of His making them His own. This is the kingdom which is said also to have a beginning. For concerning this He says also in the second Psalm, <q>Ask of Me, and I shall give You the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> for Your inheritance.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa002.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 2:8</font></u></a></span> Touching this also, He Himself said to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, <q>All authority has been given unto Me by My father,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat028.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 28:18</font></u></a></span> referring all to Him that begot Him, not as though of Himself He were not sufficient, but to signify that He is a Son, and not unbegotten. This kingdom then He does <q>deliver up,</q> i.e., <q>bring to a right end.</q></p>
<p><q>What then,</q> says one, <q>can be the reason why He spoke nothing of the Spirit?</q> Because of Him he was not discoursing now, nor does he confound all things together. Since also where he says, <q>There is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">one God</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and one Lord Jesus,</q> undoubtedly not as allowing the Spirit to be inferior, is he therefore silent, but because for the time it was not urgent, he so expressed himself. For he is wont also to make mention of the Father only, yet we must not therefore cast out the Son: he is wont to speak also of the Son and of the Spirit only, yet not for this are we to deny the Father.</p>
<p>But what is, <q>that God may be all in all?</q> That all things may be dependent upon Him, that none may suppose two authorities without a beginning, nor another kingdom separated off; that nothing may exist independent of him. For when the enemies shall be lying under the feet of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and He having them cast under His feet be at no variance with His Father, but at concord with Him in entire perfection, then He shall Himself <q>be all in all.</q></p>
<p>But some say that he spoke this to declare the removal of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, as though all would yield thenceforth and none would resist nor do iniquity. For when there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, it is evident that <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> shall be all in all.</q></p>
<p>12. But if bodies do not rise again, how are these things <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>? For the worst enemy of all, death, remains, having wrought whatever he listed. <q>Nay,</q> says one, <q>for they shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> no more.</q> And what of that? For he is not discoursing here of the death of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, but of that of the body? How then is he <q>put down?</q> For victory is this, the winning of those things which have been carried off and detained. But if men's bodies are to be detained in the earth, it follows that the tyranny of death remains, these bodies for their part being holden, and there being no other body for him to be vanquished in. But if this which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> spoke of, ensue, as undoubtedly it will ensue, God's victory will appear, and that a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> one, in His being able to raise again the bodies which were holden thereby. Since an enemy too is then vanquished, when a man takes the spoils, not when he suffers them to remain in the other's possession: but unless one venture to take what is his, how can we say that he is vanquished? After this manner of victory does Christ Himself say in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a> that He has been victorious, thus speaking, <q>When he shall bind the strong man, then shall he also spoil his goods.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:29</font></u></a></span> Since if this were not so, it would not be at all a manifest victory. For as in the death of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, <q>he that has died is justified from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:7</font></u></a></span> (and yet we cannot say that this is a victory, for he is not the victor who adds no more to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, but he who has done away the former captivity of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>;) just so in this instance also, I should not call death's being stayed from feeding on the bodies of men a splendid victory, but rather that the bodies heretofore holden by him should be snatched away from him.</p>
<p>But if they should still be contentious and should say that these things were spoken of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul's</font></u></a> death, how is this <q>destroyed last?</q> since in the case of each one at his Baptism it has been destroyed perfectly. If however you speak of the body, the expression is admissible; I mean, such a saying as that it will be <q>last destroyed.</q></p>
<p>But if any should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> why discoursing of the resurrection, he did not bring forward the bodies which rose again in the time of our Lord, our answer might be the following: that this could not be alleged in behalf of the resurrection. For to point out those who after rising died again, suited not one employed in proving that death is entirely destroyed. Yea, this is the very reason why he said that he is <q>destroyed last,</q> that you might never more suspect his rising again. For when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is taken away, much more shall death cease: it being out of all reason when the fountain is dried up, that the stream flowing from it should still subsist; and when the root is annihilated, that the fruit should remain.</p>
<p>13. Since then in the last day the enemies of God shall be destroyed, together with death and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a>, let us not be dejected at the prosperity of the enemies of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For the enemies of the Lord in the moment of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and exaltation fail; <q>yea, like smoke have they failed away.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa036.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 37:20</font></u></a></span> When you see any enemy of God <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>, with armed attendants and many flatterers, be not cast down, but lament, weep, call upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that He may enrol him among His friends: and the more he prospers being God's enemy, so much the more do thou mourn for him. For sinners we ought always to bewail, but especially when they enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and abundance of good days; even as one should the sick, when they eat and drink to excess.</p>
<p>But there are some, who when they hear these words are of so unhappy a disposition, as to sigh bitterly thereupon, and say, <q>Tears are due to me who have nothing.</q> You have well said, <q>who have nothing,</q> not because you have not what another has, but because you account the thing such as to be called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>; yea, for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> are you worthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> lamentations: even as, if a person living in health should count <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> him that is sick and lying on a soft couch, this latter is not near so wretched and miserable as he, because he has no sense of his own advantages. Just such a result one may observe in these men's case also: nay, and hereby our whole life is confounded and disordered. For these sayings have undone many, and betrayed them to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and made them more pitiable than such as are wasted with famine. Yea, that those who long after more, are more wretched than mendicants, as being possessed with a greater and bitterer sorrow than they, is evident from what follows.</p>
<p>A drought once overtook our city, and all were trembling for the last of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, and were beseeching God to rid them of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. And one might see then that which was spoken of by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu028.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 28:23</font></u></a></span> <q>the heavens become brass,</q> and a death, of all deaths the most horrible, waited for every day. But afterwards, when it seemed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> to the merciful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, beyond all expectation there was wafted down from heaven a great and plentiful rain, and thenceforth all were in holiday and feasting, as having come up from the very gates of death. But in the midst of so great blessings and the common <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a> of all, one of those exceedingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a> people went about with a gloomy and downcast countenance, quite dead with sorrow; and when many enquired the reason, wherefore in the common <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> he alone is sorrowful, he could not even keep within him his savage passion, but goaded by the tyranny of the disease, declared before them all the reason. <q>Why,</q> says he, <q>having in my possession ten thousand measures of wheat, I have no means of disposing of them left.</q> Shall we then count him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>, tell me, for these words, for which he deserved to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>? Him that was more cruel than any wild beast, the common enemy? What do you say, man? Are you sad because all did not perish, that you might gather gold? Have you not heard what Solomon says, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro011.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 11:26</font></u></a></span> <q>He that withholds grain, the people shall curse him?</q> but goest about a common enemy of the blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of the world, and a friend of Mammon, or rather his slave? Nay, does not that tongue deserve to be cut out, and the heart to be quenched, that brought forth these words?</p>
<p>14. Do you see how gold does not suffer men to be men, but wild beasts and fiends? For what can be more pitiful than this rich man, whose daily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> is that there may be famine, in order that he may have a little gold? Yea, and his passion by this time has come round to the contrary of itself: he not even rejoicing in his abundant store of the fruits of the earth, but on this very account grieving the rather, (to such a pass is he come,) that his possessions are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a>. Although one who has much ought to be joyful: but this man on that very account is dejected. Do you see that, as I said, the rich do not reap as much pleasure from what is present, as they endure sorrow for what has not yet been added? For he that had innumerable quantities of wheat did more grieve and lament than he who suffered hunger. And while the one, on merely having his necessary food, was crowning himself and leaping for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> and giving thanks to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; the other, who had so much, was fretting and thought he was undone. It is not then the superfluity which causes our pleasure, but a self-controlling mind: since without this, though one obtain and have all, he will feel as one deprived of all and will mourn accordingly:  inasmuch as this man too of whom we are now speaking, even if he had sold all he had for as large a sum as he wished, would again have grieved that it was not for more; and if he could have had more, he would again have sought another advance; and if he had disposed of the bushel for one pound, he would even then have been distracted for sorrow, that the half bushel could not be sold for as much. And if the price were not set so high at first, marvel not. Since drunkards also are not at first inflamed, but when they have loaded themselves with much wine, then they kindle the flame into greater fierceness: so these men, by how much more they have grasped, in so much the greater poverty do they find themselves, and they who gain more than others, are the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to be the most in want.</p>
<p>15. But I say these things not only to this man, but also to each one of those who are so diseased: those, I say, who raise the price of their wares and make a traffic of the poverty of their neighbors. For of humanity none any where makes account: but every where the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> desire brings out many at the time of sale. And oil and wine is sold by one quicker, by another more slowly, but neither out of regard to others; rather the one seeks gain, the other to avoid loss by the spoiling of his produce. Thus, because most men not making much account of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, shut up and keep all in doors, God by other means leading them to humanity—that were it but of necessity they may do something kind—has infused into them the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of greater loss, not allowing the fruits of the earth to keep any long time, in order that out of mere dread of the damage from their spoiling, they may expose for sale to the needy, even against their will, such things as they wickedly bury at home and keep. However, after all this, some are so insatiable as not even thereby to be corrected. Many, for example, have gone so far as to empty whole casks, not giving even a cup-full to the poor man, nor a piece of money to the needy, but after it has become vinegar, they dash it all upon the ground, and destroy their casks together with the fruit. Others again who would not give a part of a single cake to the hungry, have thrown whole granaries into some river: and because they listened not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> who bade them give to the needy, at the bidding of the moth, even unwillingly, they emptied out all they had in their houses, in utter destruction and waste; drawing down upon their own heads together with this loss much scorn and many a curse.</p>
<p>And such is the course of their affairs here; but the hereafter, what words shall set before us? For as these men in this world cast their moth-eaten grain, become useless, into rivers; even so the doers of such things, on this very account become useless, God casts into the river of fire. Because as the grain by the moth and worm, so are their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> devoured by cruelty and inhumanity. And the reason of these things is their being nailed to things present, and gaping after this life only. Whence also such men are full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> sadness; for name whatever pleasure you will, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of their end is enough to annihilate all, and such an one <q>is dead, while he is yet alive.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:6</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Now then that unbelievers should have these feelings, is no marvel; but when they who have partaken of so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> and learned such high rules of self-denial concerning things to come, delight to dwell in things present, what indulgence do they deserve?</p>
<p>16. Whence then arises their loving to dwell in present things? From giving their mind to luxury, and fattening their flesh, and making their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> delicate, and rendering their burden heavy, and their darkness great, and their veil thick. For in luxury the better part is enslaved, but the worse prevails; and the former is blinded on every side and dragged on in its maimed condition; while the other draws and leads men about every where, though it ought to be in the rank of things that are led.</p>
<p>Since great indeed is the bond between the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and the body; the Maker having contrived this, lest any should induce us to abhor it as alien. For God indeed bade us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> our enemies; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> has so far prevailed as to induce some even to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> their own body. Since when a man says that it is of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, he proves nothing else than this; which is the extreme of dotage. For if it be of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, what is this so perfect harmony, such as to render it meet in every way for the energies of the self-controlling <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? <q>Nay,</q> says one, <q>if it be meet, how does the body blind it?</q> It is not the body which blinds the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; far from it, O man; but the luxury. But whence do we desire the luxury? Not from our having a body, by no means; but from an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> choice. For the body requires feeding, not high feeding , the body needs nourishing, not breaking up and falling apart. You see that not to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> only, but to the very body also which receives the nourishment, the luxury is hostile. For it becomes weaker instead of strong, and softer instead of firm, and sickly instead of healthful, and heavier instead of light, and slighter instead of compact, and ill-favored instead of handsome, and unsavory instead of fragrant, and impure instead of clean, and full of pain instead of being at ease, and useless instead of useful, and old instead of young, and decaying instead of strong, and slow and dull instead of quick, and maimed instead of whole. Whereas if it were of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, it ought not to receive injury from the things of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, I mean, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>17. But neither is the body, nor food, of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, but luxury alone. For by means of it that malignant fiend brings to pass his innumerable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. Thus did he make victims of a whole people. <q>For the beloved waxed fat,</q> says one, <q>and grew thick, and was enlarged, and kicked.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu032.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 32:15</font></u></a></span> And thence also was the beginning of those thunderbolts on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>. And to declare this, Ezekiel said, <q>But this was the iniquity of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> and fullness of bread and refinements they waxed wanton.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze016.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 16:4</font></u></a></span> Therefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:6</font></u></a></span> <q>She that gives herself to pleasure , is dead while she lives.</q> How should this be? Because as a sepulchre she bears about her body, bound close to innumerable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. And if the body so perish, how will the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> be affected; what disorder, what waves, what a tempest will she be filled with? Hereby, you see, she becomes unfitted for every duty, and will have no power easily to speak, or hear, or take counsel, or do anything that is needful. But as a pilot when the storm has got the better of his skill, is plunged into the deep, vessels and sailors and all: so also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> together with the body is drowned in the grievous abyss of insensibility.</p>
<p>For, in fact, God has set the stomach in our bodies as a kind of mill, giving it a proportionate power, and appointing a set measure which it ought to grind every day. If therefore one cast in more, remaining undigested it does injury to the whole body. Hence diseases and weaknesses and deformities: since in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> luxury makes the beautiful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> not only sickly, but also foul to look upon. For when she is continually sending forth unpleasant exhalations, and breathes fumes of stale wine, and is more florid than she ought to be, and spoils the symmetry that beseems a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, and loses all her seemliness, and her body becomes flabby, her eyelids bloodshot and distended, and her bulk unduly great, and her flesh an useless load; consider what a disgust it all produces.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have heard a physician say that many have been hindered from reaching their proper height by nothing so much as luxurious living. For the breath being obstructed by the multitude of things which are cast in and being occupied in the digestion of such things, that which ought to serve for growth is spent on this digestion of superfluities. Why need one speak of gout, rheum dispersed every where, the other diseases hence arising, the whole abomination? For nothing is so disgusting as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> pampering herself with much food. Therefore among the poorer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> one may see more of beauty: the superfluities being consumed and not cleaving to them, like some superfluous clay, of no use and benefit. For their daily exercise, and labors, and hardships, and their frugal table, and spare diet, minister unto them much soundness of body, and thence also much bloom.</p>
<p>18. But if you talk of the pleasure of luxury, you will find it to go no farther than the throat: since as soon as it has passed the tongue, it is flown away, leaving behind in the body much that is disgusting. For do not I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> look on the voluptuaries at table only, but when you see them rise up, then follow them, and you will see bodies rather of wild beasts and irrational creatures than of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> beings. You will see them with headache, distended, bound up, needing a bed and a couch and plenty of rest, and like men who are tossed in a great tempest and require others to save them, and long for that condition in which they were before they were swelled even to bursting : they carrying their bellies about with a burden like that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> with child, and can scarce step forward, and scarce see, and scarce speak, and scarce do any thing. But if it should chance that they sleep a little, they see again strange dreams and full of all manner of fancies.</p>
<p>What should one say of that other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> of theirs? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, I mean, for this also has its fountains from hence. Yea, as horses wild after the female, so they, goaded on by the sting of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, leap upon all, more irrational than they, and more frantic in their boundings; and committing many more unseemlinesses which but to name is unlawful. For they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not in fact any longer what they suffer, nor what they do.</p>
<p>But not so he that keeps from luxury: rather he sits in harbor, beholding other men's shipwrecks, and enjoys a pleasure pure and lasting, following after that life which becomes him that is free. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> therefore these things, let us flee from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> banquets of luxury and cleave to a spare table; that being of a good habit both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and body, we may both practice all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and attain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:29"></a>1 Corinthians 15:29</h2>
<p>Else what shall they do which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> for the dead?</p>
<p>He takes in hand again another topic, establishing what he said at one time from what God does , and at another from the very things which they practice. And this also is no small plea for the defence of any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> when a man brings forward the gainsayers themselves as witnessing by their own actions what he affirms. What then is that which he means? Or will you that I should first mention how they who are infected with the Marcionite <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresy</font></u></a> pervert this expression? And I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> indeed that I shall excite much laughter; nevertheless, even on this account most of all I will mention it that you may the more completely avoid this disease: viz., when any Catechumen departs among them, having concealed the living man under the couch of the dead, they approach the corpse and talk with him, and ask him if he wishes to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>; then when he makes no answer, he that is concealed underneath says in his stead that of course he should wish to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>; and so they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptize</font></u></a> him instead of the departed, like men jesting upon the stage. So great power has the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> over the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of careless sinners. Then being called to account, they allege this expression, saying that even the Apostle has said, <q>They who are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> for the dead.</q> Do you see their extreme ridiculousness? Is it meet then to answer these things? I trow not; unless it were necessary to discourse with madmen of what they in their frenzy utter. But that none of the more exceedingly simple folk may be led captive, one must needs submit to answer even these men. As thus, if this was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> meaning wherefore did God threaten him that is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>? For it is impossible that any should not be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> henceforth, this being once devised: and besides, the fault no longer lies with the dead, but with the living. But to whom spoke he, <q>Unless you eat My flesh, and drink My blood, you have no life in yourselves?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh006.htm#verse53" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 6:53</font></u></a></span> To the living, or to the dead, tell me? And again, <q>Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, he cannot see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh003.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 3:5</font></u></a></span> For if this be permitted, and there be no need of the mind of the receiver nor of his assent while he lives, what hinders both Greeks and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> thus to become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>, other men after their decease doing these things in their stead?</p>
<p>But not to prolong fruitless toil in cutting asunder their petty spiders' webs , come let us unfold unto you the force of this expression. What then is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> speaking of?</p>
<p>2. But first I wish to remind you who are initiated of the response , which on that evening they who introduce you to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> bid you make; and then I will also explain the saying of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: so this likewise will be clearer to you; we after all the other things adding this which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> now says. And I desire indeed expressly to utter it, but I dare not on account of the uninitiated; for these add a difficulty to our exposition, compelling us either not to speak clearly or to declare unto them the ineffable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>. Nevertheless, as I may be able, I will speak as through a veil. </p>
<p>As thus: after the enunciation of those mystical and fearful words, and the awful rules of the doctrines which have come down from heaven, this also we add at the end when we are about to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptize</font></u></a>, bidding them say, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in the resurrection of the dead,</q> and upon this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> we are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>. For after we have confessed this together with the rest, then at last are we let down into the fountain of those sacred streams. This therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> recalling to their minds said, <q>if there be no resurrection, why are you then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> for the dead ?</q> i.e., the dead bodies. For in fact with a view to this are you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>, the resurrection of your dead body, believing that it no longer remains dead. And thou indeed in the words makest mention of a resurrection of the dead; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>, as in a kind of image, signifies to you by very deed the things which you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> and confessed in words. When without a sign you believe, then he gives you the sign also; when you have done your own part, then also does God fully assure you. How and in what manner? By the water. For the being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> and immersed and then emerging, is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a> of the descent into Hades and return thence. Wherefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> calls <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> a burial, saying, <q>Therefore we are buried with Him by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> into death.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:4</font></u></a></span> By this he makes that also which is to come credible, I mean, the resurrection of our bodies. For the blotting out <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> is a much greater thing than the raising up of a body. And this Christ declaring, said, <q>For whether is easier to say, Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> are forgiven, or to say, Take up your bed, and walk?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat009.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 9:5</font></u></a></span> <q>The former is the more difficult,</q> says He, <q>but since you disbelieve it as being hidden, and make the easier instead of the more difficult the demonstration of my power, neither will I refuse to afford you this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>.</q> Then says He to the paralytic, <q>Arise, take up your bed, and go unto your house.</q></p>
<p><q>And how is this difficult,</q> says one, <q>when it is possible to kings also and rulers? For they too forgive adulterers and homicides.</q> You are jesting, O man, who sayest these things. For to forgive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> with God only is possible. But rulers and kings, whether it is adulterers whom they forgive or homicides, release them indeed from the present punishment; but their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> they do not purge out. Though they should advance to offices them that have been forgiven, though they should invest them with the purple itself, though they should set the diadem upon their heads, yet so they would only make them kings, but could not free them from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. It being God alone who does this; which accordingly in the Laver of Regeneration He will bring to pass. For His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> touches the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and thence plucks up the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> by the root. Here is the reason why he that has been forgiven by the king may be seen with his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> yet impure, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> no longer so, but purer than the very sun-beams, and such as it was originally formed, nay rather much better than that. For it is blessed with a Spirit, on every side enkindling it and making its <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> intense. And as when you are recasting iron or gold you make it pure and new once more, just so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> also, recasting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> as in a furnace and consuming its <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, causes it to glisten with more purity than all purest gold.</p>
<p>Further, the credibility of the resurrection of our bodies he signifies to you again from what follows: viz., that since <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> brought in death, now that the root is dried up, one must not after that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> of the destruction of the fruit. Therefore having first mentioned <q>the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>,</q> you next confess also <q>the resurrection of the dead;</q> the one guides you as by hand on to the other.</p>
<p>Yet again, because the term Resurrection is not sufficient to indicate the whole: for many after rising have again departed, as those in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>, as Lazarus, as they at the time of the crucifixion: one is bid to say, <q>and the life everlasting,</q> that none may any longer have a notion of death after that resurrection.</p>
<p>These words therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> recalling to their minds, says, <q>What shall they do which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> for the dead?</q> <q>For if there be no resurrection,</q> says he, <q>these words are but scenery. If there be no resurrection, how persuade we them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> things which we do not bestow?</q> Just as if a person bidding another to deliver a document to the effect that he had received so much, should never give the sum named therein, yet after the subscription should demand of him the specified monies. What then will remain for the subscriber to do, now that he has made himself responsible, without having received what he admitted he had received? This then he here says of those who are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> also. <q>What shall they do which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>having subscribed to the resurrection of dead bodies, and not receiving it, but suffering fraud? And what need was there at all of this confession, if the fact did not follow?</q> </p>

<p>3. <q>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</q></p>
<p><q>I protest by that glorying in you which I have in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, I die daily.</q></p>
<p>See again whence he endeavors to establish the doctrine, from his own suffrage: or rather not from his only, but from that also of the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>. And this too is no small thing; that the teachers whom you produce were full of vehement conviction and signified the same not by words only, but also by very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>. Therefore, you see, he does not say simply, <q>we are persuaded,</q> for this alone was not sufficient to persuade them, but he also furnishes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> by facts; as if he should say, <q>in words to confess these things haply seems to you no marvel; but if we should also produce unto you the voice which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> send forth, what can you have to say against that? Hear ye then, how by our perils also day by day we confess these things?</q> And he said not <q>I,</q> but <q>we,</q> taking along with him all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> together, and thereby at once speaking modestly and adding credibility to his discourse.</p>
<p>For what can you have to say? That we are deceiving you when we preach these things, and that our doctrines come of vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>? Nay, our perils suffer you not to pass such a sentence. For who would choose to be in continual jeopardy to no purpose and with no effect? Wherefore also he said, <q>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</q> For if one should even choose it through vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, such his choice will be but for once and again, not all his life long, like ours. For we have assigned our whole life to this purpose.</p>
<p><q>I protest by that glorying in you which I have in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, I die daily:</q> by glorying here, meaning their advancement. Thus since he had intimated that his perils were many, lest he might seem to say this by way of lamentation, <q>far from grieving,</q> says he, <q>I even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> in suffering this for your sake.</q> And doubly, he says, he takes delight in it, both as being in jeopardy for their sakes and as beholding their proficiency. Then doing what is usual with him, because he had uttered great things, he refers both to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But how does he <q>die daily?</q> by his readiness and preparation for that event. And wherefore says he these words? Again by these also to establish the doctrine of the resurrection. <q>For who would choose,</q> says he, <q>to undergo so many deaths, if there be no resurrection nor life after this? Yea, if they who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in the resurrection would scarcely put themselves in jeopardy for it except they were very noble of heart: much more would not the unbeliever (so he speaks) choose to undergo so many deaths and so terrible.</q> Thus, see by degrees how very high he mounts up. He had said, <q>we stand in jeopardy,</q> he added, <q>every hour,</q> then, <q>daily,</q> then, <q>I not only 'stand in jeopardy,'</q> says he, but <q>I even 'die:'</q> he concludes accordingly by pointing out also what kind of deaths they were; thus saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:32"></a>1 Corinthians 15:32</h2>
<p><q>If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me?</q></p>
<p>What is, <q>if after the manner of men?</q> <q>As far as pertains to men I fought with beasts: for what if God snatched me out of those dangers? So that I am he who ought most to be in care about these things; I, who endure so great dangers and have not yet received any return. For if no time of recompense is at hand, but our reward is shut up in this present world, ours is the greater loss. For you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> without jeopardy, but we are slaughtered every day.</q></p>
<p>But all these things he said, not because he had no advantage even in the very suffering, but on account of the weakness of the many, and to establish them in the doctrine of the resurrection: not because he himself was running for hire; for it was a sufficient recompense to him to do that which was pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. So that when he adds, <q>If in this life only we have hoped in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, we are of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> most pitiable,</q> it is there again for their sakes, that he might by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of this misery overthrow their unbelief of the resurrection. And in condescension to their weakness, he thus speaks. Since in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, the great reward is to please Christ at all times: and apart from the recompense, it is a very great requital to be in jeopardy for His sake.</p>
<p>4. <q>If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.</q></p>
<p>This word, be sure, is spoken in mockery: wherefore neither did he bring it forward of himself, but summoned the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> of loftiest sound, Isaiah, who discoursing of certain insensible and reprobate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> made use of these words, <q>Who slay oxen and kill sheep to eat flesh and drink wine; who say, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. These things are revealed to the ears of the Lord of Hosts, and this iniquity shall not be forgiven you, till ye die.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa022.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 22:13-14</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13722a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Septuagint</font></u></a></span> Now if then they were deprived of pardon who spoke thus, much more in the time of Grace.</p>
<p>Then that he might not make his discourse too rough, he dwells not long upon his <q><em>reduc</em> <em>tio ad absurdum</em>,</q> but again turns his discourse to exhortation, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:33"></a>1 Corinthians 15:33</h2>
<p><q>Be not deceived: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> company does corrupt good manners.</q></p>
<p>And this he said, both to rebuke them as without understanding, (for here he by a charitable expression, calls <q>good</q> that which is easily deceived,) and also, as far as he could, to make some allowance to them for the past with a view to their return, and to remove from them and transfer to others the greater part of his charges, and so by this way also to allure them to repentance. Which he does likewise in the Epistle to the Galatians, saying, <q>But he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal005.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 5:10</font></u></a></span></p>

<p><q>Awake up righteously and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> not.</q></p>
<p>As if he were speaking to drunkards and madmen. For suddenly to cast every thing out of their hands, was the part of drunkards and madmen, in not seeing any longer what they saw nor believing what they had before confessed. But what is, <q>righteously?</q> with a view to what is profitable and useful. For it is possible to awake up unrighteously, when a man is thoroughly roused up to the injury of his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. And well did he add, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> not,</q> implying that hence were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of their unbelief. And in many places he covertly signifies this, that a corrupt life is the parent of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doctrines; as when he says, <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a> is a root of all kinds of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, which some reaching after, have been led astray from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:10</font></u></a></span> Yea, and many of those who are conscious of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> and would fain not pay its penalty are by this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> damaged also in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> concerning the resurrection: even as they who do very virtuously desire even daily to behold it.</p>
<p><q>For some have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; I speak this to move you to shame.</q></p>
<p>See how again he transfers his accusations to others. For he said not, <q>You have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>,</q> but, <q>some have no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>.</q> Because disbelieving the resurrection is the temper of one not fully aware that the power of God is irresistable and sufficient for all things. For if out of the things which are not He made the things that are, much more will He be able to raise again those which have been dissolved.</p>
<p>And because he had touched them to the quick and exceedingly mocked them, accusing them of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a>, of folly, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>; mitigating those expressions, he says, <q>I speak to move you to shame,</q> that is, to set upright, to bring back, to make you better, by this shame of yours. For he feared lest if he cut too deep, he should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> them to start away.</p>
<p>5. But let us not consider these things as spoken to them only, but as addressed now also to all who labor under the same disease, and live a corrupt life. Since in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> not they who hold corrupt doctrines only, but they too who are holden of grievous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, are both drunken and frantic. Wherefore also to them may it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> said, <q>Awake,</q> and especially to those who are weighed down by the lethargy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a>; who rob wickedly. For there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a> which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, which injures not. And although in respect of money it is impossible for one to become rich, unless another first become poor: yet in spiritual things this is not so, but wholly the reverse: it is impossible that any should become rich without making another's store plentiful. For if you help no one, you will not be able to grow <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>. Thus, whereas in temporal things imparting causes diminution: in spiritual things, on the contrary, imparting works increase, and the not imparting, this produces great poverty and brings on extreme punishment. And this is signified by him who buried the talent. Yea, and he too who has a word of wisdom, by imparting to another increases his own abundance, by making many wise: but he that buries it at home, deprives himself of his abundance by neglecting to win the profit of the many. Again, he that had other gifts, by healing many augmented his own gift: and was neither himself emptied by the imparting, and filled many others with his own spiritual gift. And in all spiritual things this rule abides unshaken. Thus also in the Kingdom, he that makes many partakers with himself of the Kingdom will hereby the more completely have the fruits of it in return: but he that studies not to have any partaker will himself be cast out of those many blessings. For if the wisdom of this world of sense is not spent, though ten thousand are forcibly seizing it; nor does the artificer by making many artificers lose his own skill; much less does he who seizes the Kingdom make it less, but then will our riches be increased when we call many to us for that purpose.</p>
<p>Let us seize then the things which cannot be spent but increase while we seize them: let us seize the things which admit of none to defraud us of them by false accusation, none to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> us for them. For so, if there were a place which had a fountain of gold gushing forth with continual flood, and flowing the more as more was drawn from it; and there were another place which had a treasure buried in the earth; from which would you desire to be enriched? Would it not be from the first? Plainly. But that this may not be a mere conception in words, consider the saying in reference to the air and the sun. For these are seized by all, and satisfy all. These, however, whether men enjoy or do not enjoy them, abide the same undiminished: but what I spoke of is a much greater thing; for spiritual wisdom abides not the same distributed or not distributed: but it rather increases in the distribution.</p>
<p>But if any endure not what I have said, but still cleave to the poverty of worldly things, snatching at the things which endure diminution: even in respect of those again, let him call to mind the food of manna <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo016.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 16:20</font></u></a></span> and tremble at the example of that punishment. For what happened in that instance, this same result may one now also see in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> men. But what then happened in worms were bred from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. This also now happens in their case. For the measure of the food is the same for all; we having but one stomach to fill; only you who eat luxuriously have more to get rid of. And as in that case they who in their houses gathered more than the lawful quantity, gathered not manna, but more worms and rottenness; just so both in luxury and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, the gluttonous and drunken gather not more dainties but more corruption.</p>
<p>6. Nevertheless, so much worse than they are the men of our time, in that they experienced this once for all and received correction; but these every day bringing into their own houses this worm much more grievous than that, neither perceive it nor are satiated. For that these things do resemble those in respect of our useless labor on them: (for in regard of punishment these are much worse:) here is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> for you to consider.</p>
<p>Wherein, I ask, differs the rich man from the poor? Has he not one body to clothe? One belly to feed? In what then has he the advantage? In cares, in spending himself, in disobeying <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in corrupting the flesh, in wasting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Yea, these are the things in which he has the advantage of the poor: since if he had many stomachs to fill, perhaps he might have somewhat to say, as that his need was more and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of expense greater. But even <q>now they may,</q> says one, <q>reply, that they fill many bellies, those of their domestics, those of their hand-maidens.</q> But this is done, not through need nor for humanity's sake, but from mere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>: whence one cannot put up with their excuse.</p>
<p>For why have you many servants? Since as in our apparel we ought to follow our need only, and in our table, so also in our servants. What need is there then? None at all. For, in fact, one master need only employ one servant; or rather two or three masters one servant. But if this be grievous, consider them that have none and enjoy more prompt attendance. For God has made men sufficient to minister unto themselves, or rather unto their neighbor also. And if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> it not, hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying, <q>These hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act020.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 20:34</font></u></a></span> After that he, the teacher of the world and worthy of heaven, disdained not to serve innumerable others; do you think it a disgrace, unless you carry about whole herds of slaves, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that this in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is what most of all brings shame upon you? For to that end did God grant us both hands and feet, that we might not stand in need of servants.  Since not at all for need's sake was the class of slaves introduced, else even along with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> had a slave been formed; but it is the penalty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> and the punishment of disobedience. But when Christ came, He put an end also to this. <q>For in Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor free.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal003.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 3:28</font></u></a></span> So that it is not necessary to have a slave: or if it be at all necessary, let it be about one only, or at the most two. What mean the swarms of servants? For as the sellers of sheep and the slave-dealers, so do our rich men take their round, in the baths and in the forum.</p>
<p>However, I will not be too exact. We will allow you to keep a second servant. But if you collect many, thou dost it not for humanity's sake, but in self-indulgence. Since if it be in care for them, I bid you occupy none of them in ministering to yourself, but when you have purchased them and hast taught them trades whereby to support themselves, let them go free. But when you scourge, when you put them in chains, it is no more a work of humanity.</p>
<p>And I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that I am giving disgust to my hearers. But what must I do? For this I am set, and I shall not cease to say these things, whether any thing come of them or not. For what means your clearing the way before you in the market place? Are you walking then among wild beasts that you drive away them that meet you? Be not afraid; none of these bite who approach you and walk near you. But do you consider it an insult to walk along side of other men? What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> is this, what prodigious folly, when a horse is following close after you, to think not of his bringing on you any insult; but if it be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, unless he be driven an hundred miles off, to reckon that he disgraces you. And why have you also servants to carry fasces, employing freemen as slaves, or rather yourself living more dishonorably than any slave? For, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, meaner than any servant is he who bears about with him so much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore they shall not so much as have a sight of the real liberty, who have enslaved themselves to this grievous passion. Nay, if you must drive and clear away, let it not be them that come near you, but your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> which you drive away; not by your servant, but by yourself: not with this scourge, but with that which is spiritual. Since now your servant drives away them that walk by your side, but you are yourself driven from your high place more disgracefully by your own self-will than any servant can drive your neighbor. But if, descending from your horse, you will drive away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> by humility, you shall sit higher and place yourself in greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, needing no servant to do this. I mean, that when you have become modest and walkest on the ground, you will be seated on the car of humility which bears you up to the very heavens, that car which has winged steeds : but if falling from it, thou pass into that of arrogance, you will be in no better state than the beggars who are drawn along the ground, nay even much more wretched and pitiable than they: since them the imperfection of their bodies compels thus to be drawn, but you the disease of your own arrogance. <q>For every one that exalts himself,</q> says He, <q>shall be abused.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:12</font></u></a></span> That we then may not be abused but exalted, let us approach towards that exaltation. For thus also shall we <q>find rest for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a></q> according to the divine oracle, and shall obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> and most exalted <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; the which may we all obtain, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy, etc. etc.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:35-36"></a>1 Corinthians 15:35-36</h2>
<p>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what manner of body do they come? Thou foolish one, that which you yourself sowest is not quickened, except it die.</p>
<p>Gentle and lowly as the apostle is to a great degree every where, he here adopts a style rather pungent, because of the impiety of the gainsayers. He is not however content with this, but he also employs reasons and examples, subduing thereby even the very contentious. And above he says, <q>Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead;</q> but here he solves an objection brought in by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. And see how again he abates the vehemence of his censure; in that he said not, <q>but perhaps you will say,</q> but he set down the objector indefinitely, in order that, although employing his impetuous style with all freedom, he might not too severely wound his hearers. And he states two difficulties, one touching the manner of the resurrection, the other, the kind of bodies. For of both they on their part made a question, saying, <q>How is that which has been dissolved raised up?</q> and, <q>with what manner of body do they come?</q> But what means, <q>with what manner of body?</q> It is as if they had said, <q>with this which has been wasted, which has perished, or with some other?</q></p>
<p>Then, to point out that the objects of their enquiry are not questionable but admitted points, he at once meets them more sharply, saying, <q>Thou foolish one, that which you yourself sowest is not quickened, except it die.</q> Which we also are wont to do in the case of those who gainsay things acknowledged.</p>
<p>2. And wherefore did he not at once appeal to the power of God? Because he is discoursing with unbelievers. For when his discourse is addressed to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>, he has not much need of reasons. Wherefore having said elsewhere, <q>He shall change the body of your humiliation, that it may be fashioned like to the body of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:2</font></u></a></span> and having indicated somewhat more than the resurrection, he stated no analogies, but instead of any demonstration, brought forward the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, going on to say, <q>according to the working whereby He is able to subject all things to Himself.</q> But here he also urges reasons. That is, having established it from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, he adds also in what comes after, these things over and above, with an eye to them who do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>; and he says, <q>O foolish one, that which You sow:</q> i.e., <q>from yourself you have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of these things, by what you do every day, and do you doubt yet? Therefore do I call you foolish because of the things daily done by your own self you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, and being yourself an artificer of a resurrection, you doubt concerning God.</q> Wherefore very emphatically he said, <q>what You sow ,</q> thou who art mortal and perishing. </p>
<p>And see how he uses expressions appropriate to the purpose he had in view: thus, <q>it is not quickened,</q> says he, <q>except it die.</q> Leaving, you see, the terms appropriate to seed, as that <q>it buds,</q> and <q>grows,</q> and <q>is dissolved,</q> he adopts those which correspond to our flesh, viz. <q>it is quickened,</q> and, <q>except it die;</q> which do not properly belong to seeds, but to bodies.</p>
<p>And he said not, <q>after it is dead it lives,</q> but, which is a greater thing, <q>therefore it lives, because it dies.</q> Do you see, what I am always observing, that he continually gives their argument the contrary turn? Thus what they made a sure sign of our not rising again, the same he makes a demonstration of our rising. For they said, <q>the body rises not again, because it is dead.</q> What then does he, retorting their argument, say? <q>Nay, but unless it died, it could not rise again: and therefore it rises again, because it died.</q> For as Christ more clearly signifies this very thing, in the words, <q>Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides by itself alone: but if it die, it bears much fruit:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh012.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 12:24</font></u></a></span> thence also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, drawing this example, said not, <q>it does not live,</q> but, <q>is not quickened;</q> again assuming the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and showing that not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the ground, but God Himself, brings it all to pass.</p>
<p>And what can be the reason that he did not bring that forward, which was more akin to the subject: I mean, the seed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>? (For our generation too begins from a sort of decay, even as that of the grain.) Because it was not of equal force, but the latter was a more complete instance: for he wants a case of something that perished entirely, whereas this was but a part; wherefore he rather alleges the other. Besides, that proceeds from a living body and falls into a living womb; but here it is no flesh, but the earth into which the seed is cast, and into the same it is dissolved, like the body which is dead. Wherefore on this account too the example was more appropriate.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:37"></a>1 Corinthians 15:37</h2>
<p>3. <q>And he who sows, sows not that body that shall be. </q></p>
<p>For the things before spoken meet the question, <q>how they are raised;</q> but this, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, <q>with what manner of body they come.</q> But what is, <q>you sow not that body which shall be?</q> Not an entire ear of grain, nor new grain. For here his discourse no longer regards the resurrection, but the manner of the resurrection, what is the kind of body which shall rise again; as whether it be of the same kind, or better and more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>. And he takes both from the same analogy, intimating that it will be much better.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, considering none of these things, dart in upon us and say, <q>one body falls and another body rises again. How then is there a resurrection? For the resurrection is of that which was fallen. But where is that wonderful and surprising trophy over death, if one body fall and another rise again? For he will no longer appear to have given back that which he took captive. And how can the alleged analogy suit the things before mentioned?</q> Why, it is not one substance that is sown, and another that is raised, but the same substance improved. Else neither will Christ have resumed the same body when He became the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> of them that rise again: but according to you He threw aside the former body, although it had not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, and took another. Whence then is that other? For this body was from the Virgin, but that, whence was it? Do you see to what absurdity the argument has come round? For wherefore shows He the very prints of the nails? Was it not to prove that it is that same body which was crucified, and the same again that rose from the dead? And what means also His type of Jonah? For surely it was not one Jonah that was swallowed up and another that was cast out upon dry land. And why did He also say, <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up?</q> For that which was destroyed, the same clearly He raised again. Wherefore also the Evangelist added, that <q>He spoke of the temple of His body.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 2:19-21</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>What is that then which he says, <q>You sow not the body that shall be?</q> i.e. not the ear of grain: for it is the same, and not the same; the same, because the substance is the same; but not the same, because this is more excellent, the substance remaining the same but its beauty becoming greater, and the same body rising up new. Since if this were not so, there were no need of a resurrection, I mean if it were not to rise again improved. For why did He at all pull down His house, except He were about to build it more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>This now, you see, he said to them who think that it is utter corruption. Next, that none again might suspect from this place that another body is spoken of, he qualifies the dark saying, and himself interprets what he had spoken, not allowing the hearer to turn his thoughts from hence in any other direction. What need is there then of our reasonings? Hear himself speaking, and explaining the phrase, <q>You sow not the body that shall be.</q> For he straightway adds, <q>but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;</q> i.e., it is not the body that shall be; not so clothed, for instance; not having a stalk and beard, but <q>a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:38"></a>1 Corinthians 15:38</h2>
<p><q>But God gives it a body even as it pleased Him.</q></p>
<p><q>Yes,</q> says one, <q>but in that case it is the work of nature.</q> Of what nature, tell me? For in that case likewise God surely does the whole; not nature, nor the earth, nor the rain. Wherefore also he making these things manifest, leaves out both earth and rain, atmosphere, sun, and hands of husbandmen, and subjoins, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> gives it a body as it pleased Him.</q> Do not thou therefore curiously inquire, nor busy yourself with the how and in what manner, when you hear of the power and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>And to each seed a body of its own.</q> Where then is the alien matter which they speak of? For He gives to each <q>his own.</q> So that when he says, <q>You sow not that which shall be,</q> he says not this, that one substance is raised up instead of another, but that it is improved, that it is more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>. For <q>to each of the seeds,</q> says he, <q>a body of its own.</q></p>
<p>4. From hence in what follows, he introducing also the difference of the resurrection which shall then be. For do not suppose, because grain is sown and all come up ears of grain, that therefore there is also in the resurrection an equality of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. For in the first place, neither in seeds is there only one rank, but some are more valuable, and some inferior. Wherefore also he added, <q>to each seed a body of its own.</q></p>
<p>However, he is not content with this, but seeks another difference greater and more manifest. For that you may not, when hearing, as I said, that all rise again, suppose that all enjoy the same reward; he laid before even in the preceding verses the seeds of this thought, saying, <q>But each in his own order.</q> But he brings it out here also more clearly, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:39"></a>1 Corinthians 15:39</h2>
<p><q>All flesh is not the same flesh.</q> For why speak I, says he, in respect of seeds? In respect of bodies let us agitate this point, concerning which we are discoursing now. Wherefore also he adds, and says,</p>
<p><q>But there is one flesh of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, another flesh of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:40"></a>1 Corinthians 15:40</h2>
<p><q>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the celestial is one, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the terrestrial is another.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:41"></a>1 Corinthians 15:41</h2>
<p><q>There is one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the sun, and another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the moon, and another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the stars: for one star differs from another star in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>And what means he by these expressions? Wherefore from the resurrection of the body did he throw himself into the discourse of the stars and the sun? He did not throw himself out, neither did he break off from his purpose; far from it: but he still keeps to it. For whereas he had established the doctrine concerning the resurrection, he intimates in what follows that great will be then the difference of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, though there be but one resurrection. And for the present he divides the whole into two: into <q>bodies celestial,</q> and <q>bodies terrestrial.</q> For that the bodies are raised again, he signified by the grain: but that they are not all in the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, he signifies by this. For as the disbelief of the resurrection makes men supine, so again it makes them indolent to think that all are vouchsafed the same reward. Wherefore he corrects both. And the one in the preceeding verses he had completed; but this he begins now. And having made two ranks, of the righteous and of sinners, these same two he subdivides again into many parts, signifying that neither righteous nor sinners shall obtain the same; neither righteous men, all of them, alike with other righteous, nor sinners with other sinners.</p>
<p>Now he makes, you see, first, one separation between righteous and sinners, where he says, <q>bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial:</q> by the <q>terrestrial</q> intimating the latter, and by the <q>celestial,</q> the former. Then farther he introduces a difference of sinners from sinners, saying, <q>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of fishes, another of birds, and another of beasts.</q> And yet all are bodies; but some are in more, and some in lesser vileness. And that in their manner of living too, and in their very constitution.</p>
<p>And having said this, he ascends again to the heaven, saying, <q>There is one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the sun, and another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the moon.</q> For as in the earthly bodies there is a difference, so also in the heavenly; and that difference no ordinary one, but reaching even to the uttermost: there being not only a difference between sun and moon, and stars, but also between stars and stars. For what though they be all in the heaven? Yet some have a larger, others a less share of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. What do we learn from hence? That although they be all in God's kingdom, all shall not enjoy the same reward; and though all sinners be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, all shall not endure the same punishment. Wherefore he added,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:42"></a>1 Corinthians 15:42</h2>
<p><q>So also is the resurrection of the dead.</q></p>
<p><q>So,</q> How? With considerable difference. Then leaving this doctrine as sufficiently <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>, he again comes to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> itself of the resurrection and the manner of it, saying,</p>
<p>5. <q>It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</q> And observe his consideration. As in the case of seeds, he used the term proper to bodies, saying, <q>it is not quickened, except it die:</q> so in the case of bodies, the expression belonging to seeds, saying, <q>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</q> He said not, <q>is produced ,</q> that you might not think it a work of the earth, but is <q>raised.</q> And by sowing here, he means not our generation in the womb, but the burial in the earth of our dead bodies, their dissolution, their ashes. Wherefore having said, <q>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption,</q> he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:43"></a>1 Corinthians 15:43</h2>
<p><q>It is sown in dishonor.</q> For what is more unsightly than a corpse in dissolution? <q>It is raised in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q>It is sown in weakness.</q> For before thirty days the whole is gone, and the flesh cannot keep itself together nor hold out for one day. <q>It is raised in power.</q> For there shall nothing prevail against it for all the future.</p>
<p>Here is why he stood in need of those former analogies, lest many on hearing of these things, that they are <q>raised in incorruption and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and power,</q> might suppose that there is no difference among those who rise again. For all indeed rise again, both in power and in incorruption; and in this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of their incorruption yet are not all in the same state of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and safety.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:44"></a>1 Corinthians 15:44</h2>
<p><q>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</q></p>
<p>What do you say? Is not <q>this</q> body spiritual? It is indeed spiritual, but that will be much more so. For now oftentimes both the abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> flies away on men's committing great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>; and again, the Spirit continuing present, the life of the flesh depends on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: and the result in such a case is a void, without the Spirit. But in that day not so: rather he abides continually in the flesh of the righteous, and the victory shall be His, the natural <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> also being present. </p>
<p>For either it was some such thing which he intimated by saying, <q>a spiritual body,</q> or that it shall be lighter and more subtle and such as even to be wafted upon air; or rather he meant both these. And if you disbelieve the doctrine, behold the heavenly bodies which are so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> and (for this time) so durable, and abide in undecaying tranquillity; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> thou from hence, that God can also make these corruptible bodies incorruptible and much more excellent than those which are visible.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:45"></a>1 Corinthians 15:45</h2>
<p>6. <q>So also it is written, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen002.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 2:7</font></u></a></span> the first man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> became a living <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: the last <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> became a life-giving Spirit.</q></p>
<p>And yet the one indeed is written, but the other not written. How then said he, <q>it is written?</q> He modified the expression according to the issue of events: as he is wont continually to do: and indeed as it is the way of every <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>. For so Jerusalem, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> said, should be <q>called a city of righteousness;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:26</font></u></a></span> yet it was not so called. What then? Did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> speak false? By no means. For he is speaking of the issue of events. And that Christ too should be called Immanuel; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa007.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 7:14</font></u></a></span> yet was he not so called. But the facts utter this voice; so also here, <q>the last <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> became a life-giving Spirit.</q></p>
<p>And these things he said that you may learn that the signs and pledges both of the present life and of that which is to come have already come upon us; to wit, of the present life, Adam, and of the life to come, Christ. For since he sets down the better things as matters of hope, he signifies that their beginning has already come to pass, and their root and their fountain been brought to light. But if the root and the fountain be evident to all, there is no need to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> of the fruits. Wherefore he says, <q>The last <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> became a life-giving Spirit.</q> And elsewhere too, He <q>shall quicken your mortal bodies through His Spirit that dwells in you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom007.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 7:11</font></u></a></span> It is the Spirit's work then to quicken.</p>
<p>Further, lest any should say, <q>why are the worse things the elder? And why has the one sort, to wit, the natural, come to pass not merely as far as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a>, but altogether; the other as far as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> only?</q>— he signifies that the principles also of each were so ordered. </p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:46"></a>1 Corinthians 15:46</h2>
<p><q>For that is not first,</q> says he, <q>which is spiritual, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</q></p>
<p>And he says not, why, but is content with the ordinance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, having the evidence from the facts testifying to that most excellent œconomy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and implying that our state is always going forward to the better; at the same time by this also adding credibility to his argument. For if the lesser have come to pass, much more ought we to expect the better.</p>
<p>7. Since then we are to enjoy so great blessings, let us take our station in this array, and bewail not the departed, but rather those that have ended their life ill. For so the husbandman, when he sees the grain dissolving, does not mourn; rather, as long as he beholds it continuing solid in the ground he is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and trembling, but when he sees it dissolved rejoices. For the beginning of the future crop is its dissolving. So let us also then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> when the corruptible house falls, when the man is sown. And marvel not if he called the burial <q>a sowing;</q> for, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, this is the better sowing: inasmuch as that sowing is succeeded by deaths and labors and dangers and cares; but this, if we lived well, by crowns and rewards; and that, by corruption and death but this by incorruption and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>, and those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> blessings. To that kind of sowing there went embraces and pleasures and sleep: but to this, only a voice coming down from heaven, and all is at once brought to perfection. And he that rises again is no more led to a life full of toil, but to a place where anguish and sorrow and sighing are fled away.</p>
<p>If you require protection and therefore mournest your husband, betake yourself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the common Protector and Saviour and Benefactor of all, to that irresistible alliance, to that ready aid, to that abiding shelter which is every where present, and is as a wall unto us on every side.</p>
<p><q>But your intercourse was a thing desirable and lovely.</q> I too <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it. But if you will trust sound reason with this grief, and wilt consider with yourself who has taken him away, and that by nobly bearing it you offer your mind as a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, even this wave will not be too strong for you to stem. And that which time brings to pass, the same do thou by your self-command. But if you shall yield to weakness, your emotion will cease indeed in time, but it will bring you no reward.</p>
<p>And together with these reasons collect also examples, some in the present life, some in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Scriptures</font></u></a>. Consider that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> slew his own son, and neither shed a tear nor uttered a bitter word. <q>But he,</q> you say, <q>was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>.</q> Nay, thou surely hast been called to a nobler field of action. And Job grieved indeed, but so much as was proper for a father who loved his children and was very solicitious for the departed; whereas what we now do, is surely the part of haters and enemies. For if when a man was taken up to court and crowned, thou were smiting yourself and lamenting, I should not say that you were a friend of him who was crowned, but a great enemy and adversary. <q>Nay,</q> say you, <q>not even as it is do I mourn for him, but for myself.</q> Well, but this is not the part of an affectionate person, to wish for your own sake that he were still in the conflict and subject to the uncertainty of the future, when he might be crowned and come to anchor; or that he should be tossed in mid ocean, when he might have been in port.</p>
<p>8. <q>But I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not whither he has gone,</q> say you. Wherefore do you not know, tell me? For according as he lived well or otherwise, it is evident whither he will go. <q>Nay, on this very account I lament,</q> say you, <q>because he departed being a sinner. </q>This is a mere pretext and excuse. For if this were the reason of your mourning for the departed, you ought to have formed and corrected him, when he was alive. The fact is thou dost every where look to what concerns yourself, not him.</p>
<p>But grant that he departed with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> upon him, even on this account one ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>, that he was stopped short in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> and added not to his iniquity; and help him as far as possible, not by tears, but by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and supplications and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> and offerings. For not unmeaningly have these things been devised, nor do we in vain make mention of the departed in the course of the divine <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, and approach God in their behalf, beseeching the Lamb Who is before us, Who takes away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> of the world—not in vain, but that some refreshment may thereby ensue to them. Not in vain does he that stands by the altar cry out when the tremendous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> are celebrated, <q>For all that have fallen asleep in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and for those who perform commemorations in their behalf. </q>For if there were no commemorations for them, these things would not have been spoken: since our service is not a mere stage show, God forbid! Yea, it is by the ordinance of the Spirit that these things are done.</p>
<p>Let us then give them aid and perform commemoration for them. For if the children of Job were purged by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> of their father, why do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> that when we too offer for the departed, some consolation arises to them? Since God is wont to grant the petitions of those who ask for others. And this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> signified saying, <q>that in a manifold Person your gift towards us bestowed by many may be acknowledged with thanksgiving on your behalf.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co001.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 1:11</font></u></a></span> Let us not then be weary in giving aid to the departed, both by offering on their behalf and obtaining <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> for them: for the common Expiation of the world is even before us. Therefore with boldness do we then intreat for the whole world, and name their names with those of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a>, of confessors, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>. For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> one body are we all, though some members are more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> than others; and it is possible from every source to gather pardon for them, from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, from our gifts in their behalf, from those whose names are named with theirs. Why therefore do you grieve? Why mourn, when it is in your power to gather so much pardon for the departed?</p>
<p>9. Is it then that you have become desolate and hast lost a protector? Nay, never mention this. For you have not surely lost your God. And so, as long as you have Him, He will be better to you than husband and father and child and kinsman: since even when they were alive, He it was who did all things.</p>
<p>These things therefore think upon, and say with David, The Lord is my light and my Saviour , whom shall I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa026.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 27:1</font></u></a></span> Say, You are a Father of the fatherless, and a Judge of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa067.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 68:5</font></u></a></span> and draw down His aid, and you shall have Him to care for you now more than before, by how much you are in a state of greater difficulty.</p>
<p>Or have you lost a child? You have not lost it; say not so. This thing is sleep, not death; removal, not destruction; a journeying from the worse unto the better. Do not then provoke God to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>; but propitiate Him. For if you bear it nobly, there will thence accrue some relief both to the departed and to yourself; but if the contrary, thou dost the more kindle God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>. For if when a servant was chastised by his master, you stood by and complain, you would the more exasperate the master against yourself. Do not then so; but give thanks, that hereby also this cloud of sadness may be scattered from you. Say with that blessed one, <q>the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job001.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 1:21</font></u></a></span> Consider how many more well-pleasing in His sight have never received children at all, nor been called fathers. <q>Nor would I wish to have been so,</q> say you, <q>for surely it were better not to have had experience than after having tasted the pleasure to fall from it.</q> Nay, I beseech you, say not so, provoke not thus also the Lord to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>: but for what you have received, give Him thanks; and for what you have not to the end, give Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Job said not that which you say unthankfully, <q>it were better not to have received,</q> but both for the one he gave thanks, saying, <q>The Lord gave;</q> and for the other he blessed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, saying, <q>The Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.</q> And his wife he thus silenced, justifying himself against her, and uttering those admirable words, <q>Have we received good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>?</q> And yet after this a fiercer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a> befell him: yet was he not even thus unnerved, but in like manner bore it nobly and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> God.</p>
<p>This also do thou, and consider with yourself that man has not taken him, but God who made him, who more than yourself cares for him and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for him: who is no enemy nor lier-in-wait. See how many, living, have made life intolerable to their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a>. <q>But do you not see the right-hearted ones?</q> say you. I see these too, but even these are not so safe as your child is. For though they are now approved, yet it is uncertain what their end will be; but for him you have no longer any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, nor do you tremble lest anything should happen to him or he experience any change.</p>
<p>These things also do thou consider respecting a good wife and guardian of your house, and for all things give thanks unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And even if you shall lose a wife, give thanks. Perhaps <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> is to lead you to continence, He calls you to a nobler field of conflict, He was pleased to set you free from this bond. If we thus command ourselves, we shall both gain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> of this life and obtain the crowns which are to come, etc. etc.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:47"></a>1 Corinthians 15:47</h2>
<p>The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.</p>
<p>Having said that <q>the natural was first,</q> and <q>the spiritual afterward,</q> he again states another difference, speaking of <q>the earthy</q> and <q>the heavenly.</q> For the first difference was between the present life and that which is to come: but this between that before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and that after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. And he stated it with a view to the most excellent way of life, saying—(for to hinder men, as I said, from such confidence in the resurrection as would make them neglectful of their practice and of perfection, from this topic also again he renders them anxious and exhorts to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, saying,)— <q>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven:</q> calling the whole by the name of <q>man ,</q> and naming the one from the better, and the other from the worst part.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:48"></a>1 Corinthians 15:48</h2>
<p><q>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy:</q> so shall they perish and have an end. <q>As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly:</q> so shall they abide <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>What then? Did not This Man too die? He died indeed, but received no injury therefrom, yea rather by this He put an end to death. Do you see how on this part of his subject also, he makes use of death to establish the doctrine of the resurrection? <q>For having, as I said before, the beginning and the head,</q> so he speaks, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> not of the whole body.</q></p>
<p>Moreover also he frames hereby his advice concerning the best way of living, proposing standards of a lofty and severe life and of that which is not such, and bringing forward the principles of both these, of the one Christ, but of the other Adam. Therefore neither did he simply say, <q>of the earth,</q> but <q>earthy,</q> i.e., <q>gross, nailed down to things present:</q> and again with respect to Christ the reverse, <q>the Lord from heaven.</q></p>
<p>2. But if any should say, therefore the Lord has not a body because He is said to be <q>from heaven,</q> although what is said before is enough to stop their mouths: yet nothing hinders our silencing them from this consideration also: viz. what is, <q>the Lord from heaven?</q> Does he speak of His nature, or His most perfect life? It is I suppose evident to every one that he speaks of His life. Wherefore also he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:49"></a>1 Corinthians 15:49</h2>
<p><q>As we have borne the image of the earthy,</q> i.e., as we have done <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, <q>let us also bear the image of the heavenly,</q> i.e., let us practise all goodness.</p>
<p>But besides this, I would fain ask you, is it of nature that it is said, <q>he that is of the earth, earthy,</q> and, <q>the Lord from heaven?</q>  <q>Yea,</q> says one. What then? Was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> only <q>earthy,</q> or had he also another kind of substance congenial with heavenly and incorporeal beings, which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> calls <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>,</q> and <q>spirit?</q> Every one sees that he had this also. Therefore neither was the Lord from above only although He is said to be <q>from heaven,</q> but He had also assumed our flesh. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> meaning is such as this: <q>as we have borne the image of the earthy,</q> i.e., <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a>, <q>let us also bear the image of the heavenly,</q> the manner of life which is in the heavens. Whereas if he were speaking of nature, the thing needed not exhortation nor advice. So that hence also it is evident that the expression relates to our manner of life.</p>
<p>Wherefore also he introduces the saying in the manner of advice and calls it an <q>image,</q> here too again showing that he is speaking of conduct, not of nature. For therefore are we become earthy, because we have done <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>: not because we were originally formed <q>earthy,</q> but because we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> came first, and then death and then the sentence, <q>Dust thou art, and unto dust shall you return.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen003.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 3:19</font></u></a></span> Then also entered in the swarm of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. For it is not simply the being born <q>of earth</q> that makes a man <q>earthy,</q> (since the Lord also was of this mass and lump ,) but the doing earthly things, even as also he is made <q>heavenly</q> by performing things meet for heaven.</p>
<p>But enough: for why need I labor overmuch in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of this, when the apostle himself goes on to unfold the thought to us, thus saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:50"></a>1 Corinthians 15:50</h2>
<p><q>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how he explains himself again, relieving us of the trouble? Which he often does: for by flesh he here denotes men's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a>, which he has done also elsewhere; as when he says, <q>But you are not in the flesh:</q> and again, <q>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:8-9</font></u></a></span> So that when he says, <q>Now this I say,</q> he means nothing else than this: <q>therefore said I these things that you may learn that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a> conduct not to a kingdom.</q> Thus from the resurrection he straightway introduced also the doctrine of the kingdom also; wherefore also he adds, <q>neither does corruption inherit incorruption, </q>i.e., neither shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> inherit that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and the enjoyment of the things incorruptible. For in many other places he calls <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> by this name, saying, <q>He that sows to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:8</font></u></a></span> Now if he were speaking of the body and not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doing, he would not have said <q>corruption.</q> For he nowhere calls the body <q>corruption,</q> since neither is it corruption, but a thing corruptible: wherefore proceeding to discourse also of it, he calls it not <q>corruption,</q> but <q>corruptible,</q> saying, <q>for this corruptible must put on incorruption.</q></p>
<p>3. Next, having completed his advice concerning our manner of life, according to his constant custom blending closely subject with subject, he passes again to the doctrine of the resurrection of the body: as follows:</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:51"></a>1 Corinthians 15:51</h2>
<p><q>Behold, I tell you a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>It is something awful and ineffable and which all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not, which he is about to speak of: which also indicates the greatness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> he confers on them; I mean, his speaking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> to them. But what is this?</p>
<p><q>We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</q> He means as follows: <q>we shall not all die, 'but we shall all be changed,'</q> even those who die not. For they too are mortal. <q>Do not thou therefore because you die, on this account <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>as if you should not rise again: for there are, there are some who shall even escape this, and yet this suffices them not for that resurrection, but even those bodies which die not must be changed and be transformed into incorruption.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:52"></a>1 Corinthians 15:52</h2>
<p><q>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.</q></p>
<p>After he had discoursed much of the resurrection, then opportunely he points out also its very marvellous character. As thus: <q>not this only,</q> says he, is wonderful that our bodies first turn to corruption, and then are raised; nor that the bodies which rise again after their corruption are better than these present ones; nor that they pass on to a much better state, nor that each receives back his own and none that of another; but that things so many and so great, and surpassing all man's reason and conception, are done <q>in a moment,</q> i.e., in an instant of time: and to show this more clearly, <q>in the twinkling of an eye,</q> says he, <q>while one can wink an eyelid.</q> Further, because he had said a great thing and full of astonishment; that so many and so great results should take place so quickly; he alleges, to prove it, the credibility of Him who performs it; as follows, <q>For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</q> The expression, <q>we,</q> he uses not of himself, but of them that are then found alive.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:53"></a>1 Corinthians 15:53</h2>
<p><q>For this corruptible must put on incorruption.</q></p>
<p>Thus lest any, hearing that <q>flesh and blood cannot inherit the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of God</font></u></a>,</q> should suppose that our bodies do not rise again; he adds, <q>this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>.</q> Now the body is <q>corruptible,</q> the body is <q>mortal:</q> so that the body indeed remains, for it is the body which is put on; but its mortality and corruption vanish away, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a> and incorruption come upon it. Do not thou therefore question hereafter how it shall live an endless life, now that you have heard of its becoming incorruptible.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:54"></a>1 Corinthians 15:54</h2>
<p>4. <q>But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this moral shall have put on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a>, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</q></p>
<p>Thus, since he was speaking of great and secret things, he again takes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/hos013.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hosea 13:14</font></u></a></span> to confirm his word. <q>Death is swallowed up in victory: </q>i.e., utterly; not so much as a fragment of it remains nor a hope of returning, incorruption having consumed corruption.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:55"></a>1 Corinthians 15:55</h2>
<p><q>O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</q></p>
<p>Do you see his noble <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? How even as one who is offering <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> for victory, having become inspired and seeing already things future as things past, he leaps and tramples upon death fallen at his feet, and shouts a cry of triumph over its head where it lies, exclaiming mightily and saying, <q>O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</q> It is clean gone, it is perished, it is utterly vanished away, and in vain have you done all those former things. For He not only disarmed death and vanquished it, but even destroyed it, and made it quite cease from being.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:56"></a>1 Corinthians 15:56</h2>
<p><q>Now the sting of death is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; and the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is the law.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how the discourse is of the death of the body? Therefore also of the resurrection of the body. For if these bodies do not rise again, how is death <q>swallowed up?</q> And not this only, but how is <q>the law the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>?</q> For that <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a></q> indeed is <q>the sting of death,</q> and more bitter than it, and by it has its power, is evident; but how is <q>the law also the power</q> thereof? Because without the law <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> was weak, being practised indeed, but not able so entirely to condemn: since although the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> took place, it was not so clearly pointed out. So that it was no small change which the law brought in, first causing us to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> better, and then enhancing the punishment. And if meaning to check <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> it did but develop it more fearfully, this is no charge against the physician, but against the abuse of the remedy. Since even the presence of Christ made the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews'</font></u></a> burden heavier, yet must we not therefore blame it, but while we the more admire it, we must <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> them the more, for having been injured by things which ought to have profited them? Yea, to show that it was not the law of itself which gives strength to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, Christ Himself fulfilled it all and was without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But I would have you consider how from this topic also he confirms the resurrection. For if this were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of death, viz. our committing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and if Christ came and took away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and delivered us from it through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>, and together with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> put an end also to the law in the transgression of which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> consists, why do you doubt any more of the resurrection? For whence, after all this, is death to prevail? Through the law? Nay, it is done away. Through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Nay, it is clean destroyed.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:57"></a>1 Corinthians 15:57</h2>
<p><q>But thanks be to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, which gives us the victory through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>For the trophy He Himself erected, but the crowns He has caused us also to partake of. And this not of debt, but of mere mercy.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-15:58"></a>1 Corinthians 15:58</h2>
<p>5. <q>Wherefore , brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable.</q></p>
<p>Just and seasonable is this exhortation after all that had gone before. For nothing so disquiets as the thought that we are buffeted without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> or profit.</p>
<p><q>Always abounding in the work of the Lord:</q> i.e., in the pure life. And he said not, <q>working that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>,</q> but <q>abounding;</q> that we might do it abundantly , and might overpass the lists.</p>
<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</q></p>
<p>What do you say? Labor again? But followed by crowns, and those above the heavens. For that former labor on man's expulsion from paradise, was the punishment of his transgressions; but this is the ground of the rewards to come. So that it cannot in fact be labor, both on this account and by reason of the great help which it receives from above: which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his adding also, <q>in the Lord.</q> For the purpose of the former was that we might suffer punishment; but of this, that we might obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore sleep, my beloved. For it cannot, it cannot be that any one by sloth should attain to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>, nor they that live luxuriously and softly. Yea it is a great thing, if straining ourselves and <q>keeping under the body</q> and enduring innumerable labors, we are able to reach those blessings. See ye not how vast this distance between heaven and earth? And how great a conflict is at hand? And how prone a thing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> man is? And how easily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> <q>besets us?</q> And how many snares are in the way?</p>
<p>Why then do we draw upon ourselves so great cares over and above those of nature, and give ourselves more trouble, and make our burden greater? Is it not enough, our having to care for our food and clothing and houses? Is it not enough to take thought for things necessary? Although even from these Christ withdraws us, saying, <q>Be not anxious for your life what you shall eat, neither for your body what you shall put on.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:25</font></u></a></span> But if one ought not to be anxious for necessary food and clothing, nor for tomorrow; they who bring on so great a mass of rubbish and bury themselves under it, when shall they shall have power to emerge? Have you not heard <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying, <q>No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of this life?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 2:4</font></u></a></span> But we even live luxuriously and eat and drink to excess and endure buffeting for external things, but in the things of heaven behave ourselves unmanly. Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the promise is too high for man?  It cannot be that one walking on the ground should ascend the arches of heaven. But we do not even study to live like men, but have become worse than the brutes.</p>
<p>Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> before what a tribunal we are to stand? Do ye not consider that both for our words and thoughts an account is demanded of us, and we take no heed even to our actions. <q>For whosoever looks on a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>,</q> says He, <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> after her has already committed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> with her.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:28</font></u></a></span> And yet they who must be accountable for a mere idle look, refuse not even to lie rotting in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> itself. <q>Whosoever shall say to his brother, You fool, shall be cast into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> fire.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:22</font></u></a></span> But we even dishonor them with ten thousand reproaches and plot against them craftily. <q>He that loves one that loves him is no better than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a>:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:46-47</font></u></a></span> but we even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> them. What indulgence then shall we have, when commanded as we are to pass over the old lines, we weave ourselves a thread of life by a yet more scanty measure than theirs? What plea shall deliver us? Who will stand up and help us when we are punished? There is no one; but it must needs be that wailing and weeping and gnashing our teeth, we shall be led away tortured into that rayless gloom, the pangs which no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> can avert, the punishments which cannot be assuaged.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat and beseech, and lay hold of your very knees, that while we have this scant viaticum of life, you would be pricked in your hearts by what has been said, that you would be converted, that you would become better men; that we may not, like that rich man, lament to no purpose in that world after our departure, and continue thenceforth in incurable wailings. For though you should have father or son or friend or any soever who has confidence towards <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, none of these shall ever deliver you, your own works having destroyed you. For such is that tribunal: it judges by our actions alone, and in no other way is it possible there to be saved.</p>
<p>And these things I say, not to grieve you nor to throw you into despair, but lest nourished by vain and cold hopes, and placing confidence in this person or that, we should neglect our own proper goodness. For if we be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a>, there will be neither righteous man nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> nor apostle nor any one to stand by us; but if we have been earnest, having in sufficiency the plea which comes from each man's own works , we shall depart with confidence, and shall obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things that are laid up for them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; to which may we all attain, etc. etc.</p></div>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:1-2"></a>1 Corinthians 12:1-2</h2>
<p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>. You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that when you were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, you were led away unto those dumb <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, howsoever ye might be led.</p>
<p>This whole place is very obscure: but the obscurity is produced by our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> of the facts referred to and by their cessation, being such as then used to occur but now no longer take place. And why do they not happen now? Why look now, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> too of the obscurity has produced us again another question: namely, why did they then happen, and now do so no more?</p>
<p>This however let us defer to another time, but for the present let us state what things were occurring then. Well: what did happen then? Whoever was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> he straightway spoke with tongues and not with tongues only, but many also prophesied, and some also performed many other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wonderful works</font></u></a>. For since on their coming over from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, without any clear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> or training in the ancient Scriptures, they at once on their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> received the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, yet the Spirit they saw not, for It is invisible; therefore God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> bestowed some sensible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of that energy. And one straightway spoke in the Persian, another in the Roman, another in the Indian, another in some other such tongue: and this made manifest to them that were without that it is the Spirit in the very person speaking. Wherefore also he so calls it, saying, <q>But to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given to profit withal;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co012.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 12:7</font></u></a></span> calling the gifts <q>a manifestation of the Spirit.</q> For as the Apostles themselves had received this sign first, so also the faithful went on receiving it, I mean, the gift of tongues; yet not this only but also many others: inasmuch as many used even to raise the dead and to cast out devils and to perform many other such wonders: and they had gifts too, some less, and some more. But more abundant than all was the gift of tongues among them: and this became to them a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of division; not from its own nature but from the perverseness of them that had received it: in that on the one hand the possessors of the greater gifts were lifted up against them that had the lesser: and these again were grieved, and envied the owners of the greater. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself as he proceeds intimates this. </p>
<p>Since then herefrom they were receiving a fatal blow in the dissolution of their charity, he takes great care to correct it. For this happened indeed in Rome also, but not in the same way. And this is why in the Epistle to the Romans he moots it indeed, but obscurely and briefly, saying thus: <q>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office; so we, who are many, are one body in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and severally members one of another. And having gifts differing according to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that was given to us, whether <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teaches to his teaching.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom012.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 12:4-8</font></u></a></span> And that the Romans also were falling into wilfulness hereby, this he intimates in the beginning of that discourse, thus saying: <q>For I say through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God has dealt to each man a measure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom012.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 12:3</font></u></a></span> With these, however, (for the disease of division and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> had not proceeded to any length,) he thus discoursed: but here with great anxiety; for the distemper had greatly spread.</p>
<p>And this was not the only thing to disturb them, but there were also in the place many soothsayers, inasmuch as the city was more than usually addicted to Grecian customs, and this with the rest was tending to offense and disturbance among them. This is the reason why he begins by first stating the difference between soothsaying and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also they received discerning of spirits, so as to discern and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> which is he that speaks by a pure spirit, and which by an impure.</p>
<p>For because it was not possible to supply the evidence of the things uttered from within themselves at the moment; (for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> supplies the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of its own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> not at the time when it is spoken, but at the time of the event;) and it was not easy to distinguish the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> prophesier from the pretender; (for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> himself, accursed as he is, had entered into them that prophesied, [See <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki022.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 22:23</font></u></a>.] bringing in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>, as if forsooth they also could foretell things to come) and further, men were easily deceived, because the things spoken could not for the present be brought to trial, ere yet the events had come to pass concerning which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> was; (for it was the end that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophet</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>:)— in order that the hearers might not be deceived before the end, he gives them a sign which even before the event served to indicate the one and the other. And hence taking his order and beginning, he thus goes on also to the discourse concerning the gifts and corrects the contentiousness that arose from hence likewise. For the present however he begins the discourse concerning the soothsayers, thus saying,</p>
<p>2. <q>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>;</q> calling the signs <q>spiritual,</q> because they are the works of the Spirit alone, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> effort contributing nothing to the working such wonders. And intending to discourse concerning them, first, as I said, he lays down the difference between soothsaying and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, thus saying,</p>
<p><q>You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that when you were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, you were led away unto those dumb <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, howsoever ye might be led.</q> Now what he means is this: <q>In the idol-temples,</q> says he, if any were at any time possessed by an unclean spirit and began to divine, even as one dragged away, so was he drawn by that spirit in chains: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> nothing of the things which he utters. For this is peculiar to the soothsayer, to be beside himself, to be under compulsion, to be pushed, to be dragged, to be haled as a madman. But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> not so, but with sober mind and composed temper and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what he is saying, he utters all things. Therefore even before the event do thou from this distinguish the soothsayer and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>. And consider how he frees his discourse of all suspicion; calling themselves to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> who had made trial of the matter. As if he had said, <q>that I lie not nor rashly traduce the religion of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, feigning like an enemy, do ye yourselves bear me <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> as you do, when you were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, how you were pulled and dragged away then.</q></p>
<p>But if any should say that these too are suspected as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>, come, even from them that are without will I make this manifest to you. Hear, for example, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a> saying thus: (Apol. Soc. c. 7.) <q>Even as they who deliver oracles and the soothsayers say many and excellent things, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> nothing of what they utter.</q> Hear again another, a poet, giving the same intimation. For whereas by certain mystical <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rites</font></u></a> and witchcrafts a certain person had imprisoned a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and the man divined, and in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05048b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">divination</font></u></a> was thrown down and torn, and was unable to endure the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>, but was on the point of perishing in that convulsion; he says to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who were practicing such mystical arts, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loose me, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you: <br />The mighty God no longer mortal flesh <br />Can hold. </p></blockquote>
<p>And again,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unbind my wreaths, and bathe my feet in drops <br />From the pure stream; erase these mystic lines, <br />And let me go. </p></blockquote>
<p>For these and such like things, (for one might mention many more,) point out to us both of these facts which follow; the compulsion which holds down the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a> and makes them slaves; and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> to which they submit who have once given themselves up to them, so as to swerve even from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">natural</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reason</font></u></a>. And the Pythoness too : (for I am compelled now to bring forward and expose another disgraceful custom of theirs, which it were well to pass by, because it is unseemly for us to mention such things; but that you may more clearly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> their shame it is necessary to mention it, that hence at least ye may come to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and exceeding mockery of those that make use of the soothsayers): this same Pythoness then is said, being a female, to sit at times upon the tripod of Apollo astride, and thus the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spirit ascending from beneath and entering the lower part of her body, fills the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>, and she with dishevelled hair begins to play the bacchanal and to foam at the mouth, and thus being in a frenzy to utter the words of her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that you are ashamed and blush when you hear these things: but they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> both in the disgrace and in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> which I have described. These then and all such things. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was bringing forward when he said, <q>You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that when you were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, you were led away unto those dumb <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, howsoever ye might be led.</q></p>
<p>And because he was discoursing with those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> well, he states not all things with exact care, not wishing to be troublesome to them, but having reminded them only and brought all into their recollection, he soon quits the point, hastening to the subject before him.</p>
<p>But what is, <q>unto those dumb <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>?</q> These soothsayers used to be led and dragged unto them.</p>
<p>But if they be themselves dumb, how did they give responses to others? And wherefore did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> lead them to the images? As men taken in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and in chains, and rendering at the same time his deceit plausible. Thus, to keep men from the notion that it was just a dumb stone, they were earnest to rivet the people to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a> that their own style and title might be inscribed upon them. But our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rites</font></u></a> are not such. He did not however state ours, I mean the prophesyings. For it was well known to them all, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> was exercised among them, as was meet for their condition, with understanding and with entire freedom. Therefore, you see, they had power either to speak or to refrain from speaking. For they were not bound by necessity, but were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> with a privilege. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> Jonah fled; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jonah 1:3</font></u></a></span> for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> Ezekiel delayed; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze003.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 3:15</font></u></a></span> for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> Jeremiah excused himself. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 1:6</font></u></a></span> And God thrusts them not on by compulsion, but advising, exhorting, threatening; not darkening their mind; for to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> distraction and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and great darkness, is the proper work of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>: but it is God's work to illuminate and with consideration to teach things needful.</p>
<p>3. This then is the first difference between a soothsayer and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>; but a second and a different one is that which he next states, saying,</p>

<p><q>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a> of God calls Jesus accursed:</q> and then another: <q>and that no man can say that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Lord, but in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q>When you see,</q> says he, <q>any one not uttering His name, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01455e.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anathematizing</font></u></a> Him, he is a soothsayer. Again, when you see another speaking all things with His Name, understand that he is spiritual.</q> <q>What then,</q> say you, must we say concerning the Catechumens? For if, no man can say that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> is the Lord but by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, what must we say of them who name indeed His Name, but are destitute of His Spirit ? But his discourse at this time was not concerning these for there were not at that time Catechumens, but concerning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> and unbelievers. What then, does no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> call upon God's Name? Did not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniacs</font></u></a> say, We <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> You who You are, the Holy One of God? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar001.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 1:24</font></u></a></span> Did they not say to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, these men are the servants of the Most High God? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:17</font></u></a></span> They did, but upon scourging, upon compulsion; never of their own will and without being scourged.</p>
<p>But here it is proper to enquire, both why the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> uttered these things and why <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> rebuked him. In imitation of his Teacher; for so Christ did also rebuke: since it was not his will to have testimony from them. And wherefore did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> also practise this? Intending to confound the order of things, and to seize upon the dignity of the Apostles, and to persuade many to pay attention to them : which had it happened, they would easily have made themselves appear from hence worthy of credit, and have brought in their own designs. That these things then might not be, and the deceit might not have a beginning, he stops their mouths even when speaking the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, so that in their falsehoods men should not at all give heed unto them, but stop their ears altogether against the things said by them.</p>
<p>4. Having therefore made manifest the soothsayers and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> both by the first sign and also by the second, he next discourses of the wonders; not passing without reason to this topic, but so as to remove the dissension which had thence arisen, and to persuade both those that had the less portion not to grieve and those who had the greater not to be elated. Wherefore also he thus began.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:4"></a>1 Corinthians 12:4</h2>
<p><q>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</q></p>
<p>And first he attends on him that had the lesser gift, and was grieved on this account. <q>For wherefore,</q> says he, <q>are you dejected? Because you have not received as much as another? Still, consider that it is a free gift and not a debt, and you will be able to soothe your pain.</q> For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> he spoke thus in the very beginning: <q>but there are diversities of gifts.</q> And he said not <q>of signs,</q> nor <q>of wonders,</q> but of <q>gifts,</q> by the name of free gifts prevailing on them not only not to grieve but even to be thankful. <q>And withal consider this also,</q> says he, that even if you are made inferior in the measure of what is given; in that it has been vouchsafed you to receive from the same source as the other who has received more, you have equal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. For certainly you can not say that the Spirit bestowed the gift on him, but an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> on you: since the Spirit bestowed it both on you and him. Wherefore he added, <q>but the same Spirit.</q> So that even if there be a difference in the gift, yet is there no difference in the Giver. For from the same Fountain you are drawing, both thou and he.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:5"></a>1 Corinthians 12:5</h2>
<p><q>And there are diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord.</q></p>
<p>Thus, enriching the consolation, he adds mention of the Son also, and of the Father. And again, he calls these gifts by another name, designing by this also an increase of consolation. Wherefore also he thus said: <q>there are diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord.</q> For he that hears of <q>a gift,</q> and has received a less share, perhaps might grieve; but when we speak of <q>a ministration,</q> the case is different. For the thing implies labor and sweat. <q>Why do you grieve then,</q> says he, <q>if he has bidden another labor more, sparing you?</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:6"></a>1 Corinthians 12:6</h2>
<p><q>And there are diversities of workings, but the same God who works all things in all.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:7"></a>1 Corinthians 12:7</h2>
<p><q>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</q></p>
<p><q>And what,</q> says one, <q>is a working?</q> and what <q>a gift?</q> and what <q>a ministration?</q> They are mere differences of names, since the things are the same. For what <q>a gift</q> is, that is <q>a ministration,</q> that he calls <q>an operation</q> also. Thus fulfil your ministry; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:5</font></u></a>. <em>ministry</em></span> and, <q>I magnify my ministration:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 11:13</font></u></a>. <em>office</em></span> and writing to Timothy, he says, Therefore I put you in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, which is in you. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 1:6</font></u></a></span> And again, writing to the Galatians, he said, for he that wrought in Peter to the Apostleship, the same was mighty in me toward the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal002.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 2:8</font></u></a></span> Do you see that he implies that there is no difference in the gifts of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>? Not confounding the Persons, God forbid! But declaring the equal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of the Essence. For that which the Spirit bestows, this he says that God also works; this, that the Son likewise ordains and grants. Yet surely if the one were inferior to the other, or the other to it, he would not have thus set it down nor would this have been his way of consoling the person who was vexed.</p>
<p>5. Now after this, he comforts him also in another kind of way; by the consideration that the measure vouchsafed is profitable to him, even though it be not so large. For having said, that it is <q>the same Spirit,</q> and <q>the same Lord,</q> and <q>the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and having thereby recovered him, he brings in again another consolation, thus saying, <q>but to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</q> For lest one should say, <q>what if there be the same Lord, the same Spirit, the same God? Yet I have received less:</q> he says, that thus it was profitable.</p>
<p>But he calls <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> a <q>manifestation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>,</q> with evident reason. For to me who am a believer, he that has the Spirit is manifest from his having been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>: but to the unbeliever this will in no way be manifest, except from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: so that hence also again there is no small consolation. For though there be a difference of gifts, yet the evidence is one: since whether you have much or little, you are equally manifest. So that if you desire to show this, that you have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, you have a sufficient demonstration.</p>
<p>Wherefore, now that both the Giver is one and the thing given a pure favor, and the manifestation takes place thereby, and this is more profitable for you; grieve not as if despised. For not to dishonor you has God done it, nor to declare you inferior to another, but to spare you and with a view to your welfare. To receive more than one has ability to bear, this rather is unprofitable, and injurious, and a fit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of dejection.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:8"></a>1 Corinthians 12:8</h2>
<p><q>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> according to the same Spirit;</q></p>

<p>Do you see how he every where makes this addition, saying, <q>through the same Spirit, and according to the same Spirit?</q> For he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> that the comfort from thence was great.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:10"></a>1 Corinthians 12:10</h2>
<p><q>To another working of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>; to another prophecies; to another discernings of spirits; to another various kind of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.</q></p>
<p>Thus, since they boasted themselves in this, therefore he placed it last, and added,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:11"></a>1 Corinthians 12:11</h2>
<p><q>But all these works one and the same Spirit.</q></p>
<p>The universal medicine in which his consolation consists is that out of the same root, out of the same treasures, out of the same streams, they all receive. And accordingly, from time to time dwelling on this expression, he levels the apparent inequality, and consoles them. And above indeed he points out both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, as supplying the gifts, but here he was content to make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, that even hence again you may understand their dignity to be the same.</p>
<p>But what is <q>the word of wisdom?</q> That which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> had, which John had, the son of thunder.</p>
<p>And what is <q>the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>?</q> That which most of the faithful had, possessing indeed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, but not thereupon able to teach nor easily to convey to another what they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>And to another, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>:</q> not meaning by this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of doctrines, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>; concerning which Christ says, <q>If you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> as a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat017.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 17:20</font></u></a></span> And the Apostles too concerning this besought Him, saying, <q>Increase our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk017.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 17:5</font></u></a></span> for this is the mother of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. But to possess the power of working <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and gifts of healing, is not the same thing: for he that had a gift of healing used only to do cures: but he that possessed powers for working <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> used to punish also. For a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> is not the healing only, but the punishing also: even as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> inflicted blindness: as Peter slew.</p>
<p><q>To another prophecies; and to another discernings of spirits.</q> What is, <q>discernings of spirits?</q> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> who is spiritual, and who is not: who is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, and who a deceiver: as he said to the Thessalonians, <q>despise not prophesyings:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th005.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 5:20-21</font></u></a></span> but proving all things, hold fast that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>. For great was at that time the rush of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> striving underhand to substitute <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsehood</font></u></a> for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>. <q>To another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.</q> For one person <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> what he spoke himself, but was unable to interpret to another; while another had acquired both these or the other of the two. Now this seemed to be a great gift because both the Apostles received it first, and the most among the Corinthians had obtained it. But the word of teaching not so. Wherefore that he places first, but this last: for this was on account of that, and so indeed were all the rest; both prophecies, and working of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, and various kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues. For none is equal to this. Wherefore also he said, <q>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, especially they who labor in the word and in teaching.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:17</font></u></a></span> And to Timothy he wrote, saying, <q>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to teaching; neglect not the gift that is in you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:13-14</font></u></a></span> Do you see how he calls it also a gift?</p>
<p>6. Next, the comfort which he before gave, when he said, <q>the same Spirit,</q> this also he here sets before us, saying, <q>But all these works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.</q> And he not only gives consolation but also stops the mouth of the gainsayer, saying here, <q>dividing to each one severally even as he will.</q> For it was necessary to bind up also, not to heal only, as he does also in the Epistle to the Romans, when he says, But who are you that repliest against God? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom009.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 9:20</font></u></a></span> So likewise here, <q>dividing to each one severally as he will.</q></p>
<p>And that which was of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, this he signifies to be of the Spirit also. For as concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, he says, <q>but it is the same God who works all things in all;</q> so also concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, <q>but all these things works one and the same Spirit.</q> But, it will be said, <q>He does it, actuated by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> Nay, he no where said this, but you feign it. For when he says, <q>who actuates all things in all,</q> he says this concerning men: you will hardly say that among those men he numbers also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, though you should be ever so manifold in your doting and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>. For because he had said <q>through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>,</q> that you might not suppose this word, <q>through,</q> to denote inferiority or the being actuated, he adds, that <q>the Spirit works,</q> not <q>is worked,</q> and works <q>as he will,</q> not as he is bidden. For as concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, the Son says that <q>He raises up the dead and quickens;</q> in like manner also, concerning Himself, that <q>He quickens whom He will:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh005.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 5:21</font></u></a></span> thus also of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, in another place, that He does all things with authority and that there is nothing that hinders Him; (for the expression, <q>blows where it lists</q> [<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 3:8</font></u></a>,] though it be spoken of the wind is apt to establish this) but here, that <q>He works all things as He will.</q> And from another place to learn that He is not one of the things actuated, but of those that actuate. <q>For who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>the things of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, but the spirit of the man? Even so the things of God none <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> save the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 2:11</font></u></a></span> Now that <q>the spirit of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>,</q> i.e., the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, requires not to be actuated that it may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the things of itself, is, I suppose, evident to every one. Therefore neither does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, that he may <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the things of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> For his meaning is like this, <q>the secret things of God</q> are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> as to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of man the secret things of herself. But if this be not actuated for that end, much less would That which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> the depths of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and needs no actuation for that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, require any actuating Power in order to the giving gifts to the Apostles.</p>
<p>But besides these things, that also, which I before spoke of, I will mention again now. What then is this? That if the Spirit were inferior and of another substance, there would have been no avail in his consolation, nor in our hearing the words, <q>of the same Spirit.</q> For he who has received from the king, I grant, may find it a very soothing circumstance, that he himself gave to him; but if it be from the slave, he is then rather vexed, when one reproaches him with it. So that even hence is it evident, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> is not of the substance of the servant, but of the King.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore as he comforted them, when he said, that <q>there are diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord; and diversities of operations, but the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>;</q> so also when he said above, <q>there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;</q> and after this again when he said, <q>But all these works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</q></p>
<p><q>Let us not, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, be at a loss,</q> says he; <q>neither let us grieve, saying, 'Why have I received this and not received that?' neither let us demand an account of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>. For if you know that he vouchsafed it from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a> care, consider that from the same care he has given also the measure of it, and be content and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in what you have received: but murmur not at what you have not received; yea, rather confess God's favor that you have not received things beyond your power.</q></p>
<p>5. And if in spiritual things one ought not to be over-curious, much more in temporal things; but to be quiet and not nicely enquire why one is rich and another poor. For, first of all, not every single rich man is rich from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but many even of unrighteousness, and rapine, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a>. For he that forbade to be rich, how can he have granted that which he forbade to receive?</p>
<p>But that I may, far above what the case requires, stop the mouths of those who concerning these things gainsay us, come, let us carry our discourse higher up, to the time when riches used to be given by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and answer me. Wherefore was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> rich whereas Jacob wanted even bread? Were not both the one and the other righteous? Does He not say concerning the three alike, <q>I am the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 3:6</font></u></a></span> Wherefore then was the one a rich man, and the other a hired servant? Or rather, why was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05527c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Esau</font></u></a> rich, who was unrighteous and a murderer of his brother, while Jacob was in bondage for so long a time? Wherefore again did Isaac live in ease all his time, but Jacob in toils and miseries? For which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also he said, <q>Few and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> are my days.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen047.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 47:9</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Wherefore did David, who was both a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> and a king, himself also live all his time in toils? Whereas Solomon his son spent forty years in security above all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, in the enjoyment of profound peace, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and going through every kind of deliciousness? What again could be the reason, that among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> also one was afflicted more, and another less? Because so it was expedient for each. Wherefore upon each our remark must be, <q>Your judgments are a great deep.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa035.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 36:6</font></u></a></span> For if those great and wonderful men were not alike exercised by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but one by poverty, and another by riches; one by ease, and another by trouble; much more ought we now to bear these things in mind.</p>
<p>8. But besides this, it becomes one to consider also that many of the things which happen do not take place according to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, but arise from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. Say not then, <q>Why is one man rich who is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, and another poor who is righteous?</q> For first of all, one may give an account of these things also, and say that neither does the righteous receive any harm from his poverty, nay, even a greater addition of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; and that the bad man in his riches possesses but a store of punishment on his future road, unless he be changed: and, even before punishment, often-times his riches become to him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, and lead him into ten thousand pitfalls. But God permits it, at the same to signify the free choice of the will, and also to teach all others not to be mad nor rave after money.</p>
<p><q>How is it then, when a man being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> is rich, and suffers nothing dreadful?</q> say you. <q>Since if being good he has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, he has it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>: but if bad, what shall we say?</q> That even therein he is to be pitied. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> added to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> aggravates the mischief. But is he a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man, and poor? Yet is he nothing injured. Is he then a bad man, and poor? This is he so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> and by desert, or rather even with advantage to himself. <q>But such an one,</q> say you, <q>received his riches from his ancestors and lavishes it upon harlots and parasites, and suffers no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>.</q> What do you say? Does he commit whoredom, and do you say, <q>he suffers no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>?</q> Is he drunken, and do you think that he is in luxury? Does he spend for no good, and do you judge that he is to be envied? Nay what can be worse than this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> which destroys the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? But you, if the body were distorted and maimed, wouldest say that his was a case for great lamentation; and do you see his whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> mutilated, yet countest him even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>? <q>But he does not perceive it,</q> say you. Well then, for this very reason again is he to be pitied, as all frantic <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are. For he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> he is sick will of course both seek the physician and submit to remedies; but he that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of it will have no chance at all of deliverance. Do you call such an one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>, tell me?</p>
<p>But it is no marvel: for the more part are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of wisdom. Therefore do we suffer the extremest penalty, being chastised and not even withdrawing ourselves from the punishment. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> are angers, dejections, and continual tumults; because when God has shown us a life without sorrow, the life of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, we leave this and mark out another way, the way of riches and money, full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. And we do the same, as if one, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> how to discern the beauty of men's bodies but attributing the whole to the clothes and the ornaments worn, when he saw a handsome <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> and possessed of natural beauty, should pass quickly by her, but when he beheld one ugly, ill-shaped, and deformed, but clothed in beautiful garments, should take her for his wife. Now also in some such way are the multitude affected about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a>. They admit the one that is deformed by nature on account of her external ornaments, but turn away from her that is fair and lovely, on account of her unadorned beauty, for which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> they ought especially to choose her.</p>
<p>9. Therefore am I ashamed that among the foolish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> there are those that practise this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, if not in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, yet so far at least as judgment goes; and who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the perishable nature of things present: whereas among us some do not even understand these things, but have their very judgment corrupted: and this while the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> is ever and anon sounding in our ears, and saying, <q>In his sight the vile person is contemned, but he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> the Lord: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa014.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 15:4</font></u></a></span> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the Lord excels every thing ; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole of man: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/ecc012.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ecclesiastes 12:13</font></u></a>;</span> be not thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> men; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa048.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 49:16</font></u></a>;</span> all flesh is grass, and all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of man as the flower of grass;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa040.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 40:7</font></u></a></span> For these and such-like things though we hear every day, we are yet nailed to earth. And as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> children, who learn their letters continuously, if they be examined concerning their order when they are disarranged, naming one instead of another, make much laughter: so also ye, when here we recount them in order, follow us in a manner; but when we ask you out of doors and in no set order, what we ought to place first and what next among things, and which after which; not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> how to answer, you become ridiculous. Is it not a matter of great laughter, tell me, that they who expect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortality</font></u></a> and the good <q>things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>,</q> should strive about things which linger here and count them enviable? For if you have need yet to learn these things that riches are no great thing, that things present are a shadow and a dream, that like smoke they are dissolved and fly away: stand for the present without the sanctuary: abide in the vestibule: since you are not yet worthy of the entrance to the palace-courts on high. For if you know not to discern their nature which is unstable and continually passing away, when will you be able to despise them?</p>
<p>But if you say you know, cease curiously to inquire and busy yourself, what can be the reason why such an one is rich and such an one poor: for you do the same when you ask these questions, as if you went round and enquire, why one is fair and another black, or one hook-nosed and another flat-nosed. For as these things make no difference to us, whether it be thus or thus; so neither poverty nor riches, and much less than they. But the whole depends upon the way in which we use them. Whether you are poor, you may live cheerfully denying yourself; or rich, you are most miserable of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> if you fly from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. For these are what really concern us, the things of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. And if these things be not added, the rest are useless. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also are those continual questions, because the most think that indifferent things are of importance to them, but of the important things they make no account: since that which is of importance to us is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of wisdom.</p>
<p>Because then ye stand I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not where, at some far distance from her, therefore is there confusion of thoughts, therefore the many waves, therefore the tempest. For when men have fallen from heavenly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of heaven, they desire present <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and become slaves and captives. <q>And how is it that we desire this,</q> say you? From the not greatly desiring that. And this very thing, whence happens it? From negligence. And whence the negligence? From contempt. And whence the contempt? From folly and cleaving to things present and unwillingness to investigate accurately the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of things. And whence again does this latter arise? From the neither giving heed to the reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> nor conversing with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> men, and from following the assemblies of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>That this therefore may not always be so, and lest wave after wave receiving us should carry us out into the deep of miseries and altogether drown and destroy us; while there is time, let us bear up and standing upon the rock, I mean of the divine doctrines and words, let us look down upon the surge of this present life. For thus shall we both ourselves escape the same, and having drawn up others who are making shipwreck, we shall obtain the blessings which are to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:12"></a>1 Corinthians 12:12</h2>
<p>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>After soothing them from the considerations that the thing given was of free favor; that they received all from <q>one and the self-same Spirit;</q> that it was given <q>to profit withal,</q> that even by the lesser gifts a manifestation was made; and withal having also stopped their mouth from the duty of yielding to the authority of the Spirit: (<q>for all these,</q> says he, <q>works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will;</q> wherefore it is not right to be over-curious:) he proceeds now to soothe them in like manner from another common example, and betakes himself to nature itself, as was his use to do.</p>
<p>For when he was discoursing about the hair of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, after all the rest he drew matter thence also to correct them, saying, <q>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? But if a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> have long hair, it is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to her?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:14-15</font></u></a></span> And when he spoke concerning the idol-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a>, forbidding to touch them, he drew an argument from the examples also of them that are without, both making mention of the Olympic games, where he says, <q>they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co009.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 9:24</font></u></a></span> and confirming these views from shepherds and soldiers and husbandmen. Wherefore he brings forward here also a common example by which he presses on and fights hard to prove that no one was really put in a worse condition: a thing which was marvellous and surprising to be able to show, and calculated to refresh the weaker sort, I mean, the example of the body. For nothing so consoles the person of small spirit and inferior gifts, or so persuades him not to grieve, as the being convinced that he is not left with less than his share. Wherefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> making out this point, thus expresses himself: <q>for as the body is one and has many members.</q></p>
<p>Do you see his exact consideration? He is pointing out the same thing to be both one and many. Wherefore also he adds, pressing the point more vigorously, <q>and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body.</q> He said not, <q>being many, are of one body,</q> but <q>the one body itself is many:</q> and those many members are this one thing. If therefore the one is many, and the many are one, where is the difference? Where the superiority? Where the disadvantage? For all, says he, are one: and not simply one, but being strictly considered in respect of that even which is principal, i.e., their being a body, they are found all to be one: but when considered as to their particular natures, then the difference comes out, and the difference is in all alike. For none of them by itself can make a body, but each is alike deficient in the making a body, and there is need of a coming together since when the many become one, then and not till then is there one body. Wherefore also covertly intimating this very thing, he said, <q>And all the members of the one body, being many, are one body.</q> And he said not, <q>the superior and the inferior,</q> but <q>being many,</q> which is common to all.</p>
<p>And how is it possible that they should be one? When throwing out the difference of the members, you consider the body. For the same thing which the eye is, this also is the foot in regard of its being a member and constituting a body. For there is no difference in this respect. Nor can you say that one of the members makes a body of itself, but another does not. For they are all equal in this, for the very reason that they are all one body.</p>
<p>But having said this and having shown it clearly from the common judgment of all, he added, <q>so also is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> And when he should have said, <q>so also is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>,</q> for this was the natural consequent he does not say it but instead of it places the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, carrying the discourse up on high and appealing more and more to the hearer's reverence. But his meaning is this: <q>So also is the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> For as the body and the head are one man, so he said that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> and Christ are one. Wherefore also he placed Christ instead of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, giving that name to His body. <q>As then,</q> says he, <q>our body is one thing though it be composed of many: so also in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> we all are one thing. For though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> be composed of many members, yet these many form one body.</q></p>
<p>2. Thus having, you see, recovered and raised up by this common example him who thought himself depreciated, again he leaves the topic of common experience, and comes to another, a spiritual one, bringing greater consolation and indicative of great equality of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. What then is this?</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:13"></a>1 Corinthians 12:13</h2>
<p><q>For in one Spirit, says he, were we all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> into one body, whether <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> or Greeks, whether bond or free.</q></p>
<p>Now his meaning is this: that which established us to become one body and regenerated us, is one Spirit: for not in one Spirit was one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>, and another another. And not only is that which has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> us one, but also that unto which He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> us, i.e., for which He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> us, is one. For we were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> not that so many several bodies might be formed, but that we might all preserve one with another the perfect nature of one body: i.e., that we might all be one body, into the same were we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>So that both He who formed it is one, and that into which He formed it is one. And he said not, <q>that we might all come to be of the same body;</q> but, <q>that we might all be one body.</q> For he ever strives to use the more expressive phrases. And well said he, <q>we all,</q> adding also himself. <q>For not even I, the Apostle, have any more than thou in this respect,</q> says he. <q>For you are the body even as I, and I even as thou, and we have all the same Head and have passed through the same birth-pains. Wherefore we are also the same body.</q> <q>And why speak I,</q> says he, <q>of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? Since even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> who were so far off from us, He has brought into the entireness of one body.</q> Wherefore having said, <q>we all,</q> he stopped not here, but added, <q>whether <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> or Greeks, whether bond or free.</q> Now if, having before been so far off, we were united and have become one, much more after that we have become one, we can have no right to grieve and be dejected. Yea, the difference, in fact, has no place. For if to Greeks and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, to bond and free, He has vouchsafed the same blessings, how can it be that after so vouchsafing He divides them, now that He has bestowed a greater perfection of unity by the supply of His gifts?</p>
<p><q>And were all made to drink of one Spirit.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:14"></a>1 Corinthians 12:14</h2>
<p><q>For the body is not one member, but many.</q></p>
<p>i.e., We have come to the same initiation, we enjoy the same Table. And why said he not, <q>we are nourished by the same body and drink the same blood?</q> Because by saying <q>Spirit,</q> he declared them both, as well the flesh as the blood. For through both are we <q>made to drink of the Spirit.</q></p>
<p>But to me he appears now to speak of that visitation of the Spirit which takes place in us after Baptism and before the Mysteries. And he said, <q>We were made to drink,</q> because this metaphorical speech suited him extremely well for his proposed subject: as if he had said respecting plants and a garden, that by the same fountain all the trees are watered, or by the same water; so also here, <q>we all drank the same Spirit, we enjoyed the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>,</q> says he.</p>
<p>If now one Spirit both formed us and gathered us all together into one body; for this is the meaning of, <q>we were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> into one body:</q> and vouchsafed us one table, and gave us all the same watering, (for this is the meaning of, <q>we were made to drink into one Spirit ,</q>) and united <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> so widely separated; and if many things then become a body when they are made one: why, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, are you continually tossing to and from their difference? But if you say, <q>Because there are many members and diverse,</q> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that this very thing is the wonder and the peculiar excellency of the body, when the things which are many and diverse make one. But if they were not many, it were not so wonderful and incredible that they should be one body; nay, rather they would not be a body at all.</p>
<p>3. This however he states last; but for the present he goes to the members themselves, saying thus:</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:15"></a>1 Corinthians 12:15</h2>
<p><q>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:16"></a>1 Corinthians 12:16</h2>
<p><q>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</q></p>
<p>For if the one being made inferior and the other superior, does not allow their being of the body, the whole is done away. Do not say therefore, <q>I am not the body, because I am inferior.</q> For the foot also has the inferior post, yet is it of the body: for the being or not being part of the body, is not from the one lying in this place and the other in that; (which is what constitutes difference of place;) but from the being conjoined or separated. For the being or not being a body, arises from the having been made one or not. But do thou, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, mark his considerate way, how he applies their words to our members. For as he said above, <q>These things have I in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:6</font></u></a></span> just so likewise here, to make his argument free from invidiousness and acceptable, he introduces the members speaking: that when they shall hear nature answering them, being thus convicted by experience herself and by the general voice, they may have nothing further to oppose. <q>For say, if you will,</q> says he, <q>this very thing, murmur as you please, you cannot be out of the body. For as the law of nature, so much more does the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> guard all things and preserve them entire.</q> And see how he kept to the rule of having nothing superfluous; not working out his argument on all the members, but on two only and these the extremes; having specified both the most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> of all, the eye, and the meanest of all, the feet. And he does not make the foot to discourse with the eye, but with the hand which is mounted a little above it; and the ear with the eyes. For because we are wont to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> not those who are very far above us, but those who are a little higher, therefore he also conducts his comparison thus.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:17"></a>1 Corinthians 12:17</h2>
<p><q>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</q></p>
<p>Thus, because, having fallen upon the difference of the members, and having mentioned feet, and hands, and eyes, and ears, he led them to the consideration of their own inferiority and superiority: see how again he consoles them, intimating that so it was expedient: and that their being many and diverse, this especially causes them to be a body. But if they all were some one, they would not be a body. Wherefore, he says, <q>If they were all one member, where were the body?</q> This however, he mentions not till afterwards; but here he points out also something more; that besides the impossibility of any one being a body, it even takes away the being of the rest.</p>
<p><q>For if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling,</q> says he.</p>
<p>4. Then because after all they were yet disturbed: that which he had done above, the same he does also now. For as there he first alleged the expediency to comfort them and afterwards stopped their mouths, vehemently saying, <q>But all these works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one man severally even as He will:</q> so also here having stated reasons for which he showed that it was profitable that all should so be, he refers the whole again to the counsel of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:18"></a>1 Corinthians 12:18</h2>
<p><q>But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased Him.</q></p>
<p>Even as he said of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, <q>as He will,</q> so also here, <q>as it pleased Him.</q> Now do not thou seek further into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, why it is thus and why not thus. For though we have ten thousand reasons to give, we shall not be so able to show them that it is well done, as when we say, that as the best Artificer pleased, so it came to pass. For as it is expedient, so He wills it. Now if in this body of ours we do not curiously enquire about the members, much more in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. And see his thoughtfulness in that he does not state the difference which arises from their nature nor that from their operation, but that from their local situation. For <q>now,</q> says he, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has set the members each one of them in the body even as it pleased Him.</q> And he said well, <q>each one,</q> pointing out that the use extends to all. For you can not say, <q>This He has Himself placed but not that: but every one according to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>, so it is situated.</q> So that to the foot also it is profitable that it should be so stationed, and not to the head only: and if it should invert the order and leaving its own place, should go to another, though it might seem to have bettered its condition, it would be the undoing and ruin of the whole. For it both falls from its own, and reaches not the other station.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:19-20"></a>1 Corinthians 12:19-20</h2>
<p>5. <q>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</q> <q>But now are they many members, but one body.</q></p>
<p>Thus having silenced them sufficiently by God's own arrangement, again he states reasons. And he neither does this always nor that, but alternates and varies his discourse. Since on the one hand, he who merely silences, confounds the hearer, and he, on the contrary, who accustoms him to demand reasons for all things, injures him in the matter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> is continually practising both the one and the other, that they may both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> and may not be confounded; and after silencing them, he again gives a reason likewise. And mark his earnestness in the combat and the completeness of his victory. For from what things they supposed themselves unequal in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> because in them there was great diversity, even from these things he shows that for this very reason they are equal in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. How, I will tell you.</p>
<p><q>If all were one member,</q> says he, <q>where were the body?</q></p>
<p>Now what he means is, If there were not among you great diversity, you could not be a body; and not being a body, you could not be one; and not being one, you could not be equal in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. Whence it follows again that if you were all equal in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, you were not a body; and not being a body, you were not one; and not being one, how could ye be equal in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>? As it is, however, because you are not all endowed with some one gift, therefore are you a body; and being a body, you are all one, and differ nothing from one another in this that you are a body. So that this very difference is that which chiefly causes your equality in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. And accordingly he adds, <q>But now they are many members, yet one body.</q></p>
<p>6. These things then let us also consider and cast out all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, and neither grudge against them that have greater gifts nor despise them that possess the lesser. For thus had God willed: let us then not oppose ourselves. But if you are still disturbed, consider that your work is oft-times such as your brother is unable to perform. So that even if you are inferior, yet in this you have the advantage: and though he be greater, he is worse off in this respect; and so equality takes place. For in the body even the little members seem to contribute no little, but the great ones themselves are often injured by them, I mean by their removal. Thus what in the body is more insignificant than the hair? Yet if you should remove this, insignificant as it is, from the eyebrows and the eyelids, you have destroyed all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the countenance, and the eye will no longer appear equally beautiful. And yet the loss is of a trifle; but notwithstanding even thus all the comeliness is destroyed. And not the comeliness only, but much also of the use of the eyes. The reason is that every one of our members has both a working of its own and one which is common; and likewise there is in us a beauty which is peculiar and another which is common. And these kinds of beauty appear indeed to be divided, but they are perfectly bound together, and when one is destroyed, the other perishes also along with it. To explain myself: let there be bright eyes, and a smiling cheek, and a red lip, and straight nose, and open brow; nevertheless, if you mar but the slightest of these, you have marred the common beauty of all; all is full of dejection; all will appear foul to look on, which before was so beautiful: thus if you should crush only the tip of the nose you have brought great deformity upon all: and yet it is the maiming of but a single member. And likewise in the hand, if you should take away the nail from one finger, you would see the same result. If now you would see the same taking place in respect of their function also, take away one finger, and you will see the rest less active and no longer performing their part equally.</p>
<p>Since then the loss of a member is a common deformity, and its safety beauty to all, let us not be lifted up nor trample on our neighbors. For through that small member even the great one is fair and beautiful, and by the eyelids, slight as they are, is the eye adorned. So that he who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> with his brother <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> with himself: for the injury done reaches not only unto that one, but himself also shall undergo no small loss.</p>
<p>7. That this then may not be, let us care for our neighbors as for ourselves, and let us transfer this image of the body now also to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and be careful for all as for our own members. For in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> there are members many and diverse: and some are more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> and some more deficient. For example, there are choirs of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, there are assemblies of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>, there are fraternities of those who shine in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> wedlock ; in short, many are the degrees of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. And in almsgiving again in like manner. For some empty themselves of all their goods: others care for a competency alone and seek nothing more than necessaries; others give of their superfluity: nevertheless, all these adorn one another; and if the greater should set at nought the less, he would in the greatest degree injure himself. Thus, suppose a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgin</font></u></a> to deal scornfully with a married <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, she has cut off no small part of her reward; and he again that emptied himself of all should he upbraid him that has not done so, has emptied himself of much of the fruit of his labors. And why speak I of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>, and men without possessions? What is meaner than those who beg? And yet even these fulfill a most important office in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, clinging to the doors of the sanctuary and supplying one of its greatest ornaments: and without these there could be no perfecting the fullness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Which thing, as it seems, the Apostles also observing made a law from the beginning, as in regard to all other things, so also that there should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>: and so great care did they use about the matter as also to set over them seven <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04647c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deacons</font></u></a>. For as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02581b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bishops</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">presbyters</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04647c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deacons</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a> and continent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, enter into my enumeration, where I am reckoning up the members of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, so also do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>. Yea, and it is no mean office which they fill. For thou indeed comest here when you will: but these both day and night sing psalms and attend: not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> only doing this; since if that were their object, they might walk in the market place and beg in the alleys: but there is in them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a> also in no small degree. At least, behold in what a furnace of poverty they are; yet never shall you hear a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemous</font></u></a> word from them nor an impatient one, after the manner of many rich men's wives. Yet some of them often lie down to their rest in hunger, and others continue constantly frozen by the cold; nevertheless, they pass their time in thanksgiving and giving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Though you give but a penny, they give thanks and implore ten thousand blessings on the giver; and if you give nothing they do not complain, but even so they bless, and think themselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> to enjoy their daily food.</p>
<p><q>Yes,</q> it is replied, <q>since whether they will or no, they must bear it.</q> Why, tell me? Wherefore have you uttered this bitter expression? Are there not shameful arts which bring gain to the aged, both men and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>? Had they not power to support themselves by those means in great abundance, provided they had chosen to cast off all care of upright living? Do you see not how many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> of that age, by becoming pimps and panders and by other such ministrations, both live, and live in luxury ? Not so these, but they choose rather to perish of hunger than to dishonor their own life and betray their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>; and they sit throughout the whole day, preparing a medicine of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> for you.</p>
<p>For no physician stretching out the hand to apply the knife, works so effectually to cut out the corruption from our wounds, as does a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man stretching out his right hand and receiving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, to take away the scars which the wounds have left. And what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> wonderful, they perform this excellent chirurgery without pain and anguish: and we who are set over the people and give you so much wholesome advice, do not more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> discourse than he does, who sits before the doors of the church, by his silence and his countenance. For we too sound these things in your ears every day, saying, <q>Be not high-minded, O man; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> is a thing that soon declines and is ready to fall away; our youth hastens on to old age, our beauty to deformity, our strength to weakness, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to contempt, our health falls away to sickness, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to meanness, our riches to poverty; our concerns are like a violent current that never will stand still, but keeps hastening down the steep.</q></p>
<p>The same advice do they also give and more than this, by their appearance and by their experience itself too, which is a yet plainer kind of advice. How many, for instance, of those who now sit without, were in the bloom of youth and did great things? How many of these loathsome looking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> surpassed many, both in vigor of body and in beauty of countenance? Nay, disbelieve it not nor deride. For surely, life is full of ten thousand such examples. For if from mean and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> many have oftentimes become kings, what marvel is it if from being great and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, some have been made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> and mean? Since the former is much the more extraordinary: but the latter, of perpetual occurrence. So that one ought not to be incredulous that any of them ever flourished in arts, and arms, and abundance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, but rather to pity them with great compassion and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> for ourselves, lest we too should sometime suffer the same things. For we too are men and are subject to this speedy change.</p>
<p>8. But perchance some one of the thoughtless, and of those who are accustomed to scoff, will object to what has been said, and will altogether deride us, saying, <q>How long will you not cease continually introducing poor men and beggars in your discourses, and prophesying to us of misfortunes, and denouncing poverty to come, and desiring to make us beggars?</q> Not from a desire to make beggars of you, O man, do I say these things, but hastening to open unto you the riches of heaven. Since he too, who to the healthy man makes mention of the sick and relates their anguish, says it not to make him diseased, but to preserve him in health, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of their calamities cutting off his remissness. Poverty seems to you to be a fearful thing and to be dreaded, even to the mere name of it. Yea, and therefore are we poor, because we are afraid of poverty; though we have ten thousand talents. For not he who has nothing is poor, but he who shudders at poverty. Since in men's calamities also it is not those who suffer great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> whom we lament and account wretched, but those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not how to bear them, even though they be small. Whereas he that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to bear them is, as all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, worthy of praises and crowns. And to prove that this is so, whom do we applaud in the games? Those who are much beaten and do not vex themselves, but hold their head on high; or those who fly after the first strokes? Are not those even crowned by us as manly and noble; while we laugh at these as unmanly and cowards? So then let us do in the affairs of life. Him that bears all easily let us crown, as we do that noble champion ; but weep over him that shrinks and trembles at his dangers, and who before he receives the blow is dead with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For so in the games; if any before he raised his hands, at the mere sight of his adversary extending his right hand, should fly, though he receive no wound, he will be laughed to scorn as feeble and effeminate and unversed in such struggles. Now this is like what happens to these who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> poverty, and cannot so much as endure the expectation of it.</p>
<p>Evidently then it is not we that make you wretched, but you yourselves. For how can it be that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> should not hence-forth make sport of you, seeing you even before the stroke afraid and trembling at the menace? Or rather, when thou dost but esteem this a threat, he will have no need so much as to strike you any more, but leaving you to keep your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, by the expectation of its being taken away he will render you softer than any wax. And because it is our nature (so to speak,) not to consider the objects of our dread so fearful after suffering, as before and while yet untried: therefore to prevent you from acquiring even this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, he detains you in the very height of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of poverty, before all experience of it, melting you down as wax in the fire. Yea, and such a man is softer than any wax and lives a life more wretched than Cain himself. For the things which he has in excess, he is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>: for those which he has not, in grief; and again, concerning what he has he trembles, keeping his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> within as a wilful runaway slave, and beset by I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what various and unaccountable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. For unaccountable desire, and manifold <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and anxiety, and trembling on every side, agitate them. And they are like a vessel driven by contrary winds from every quarter, and enduring many heavy seas. And how much better for such a man to depart than to be enduring a continual storm? Since for Cain also it were more tolerable to have died than to be for ever trembling. </p>
<p>Lest we then for our part suffer these things, let us laugh to scorn the device of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, let us burst his cords asunder, let us sever the point of his terrible spear and fortify every approach. For if you laugh at money, he has not where to strike, he has not where he may lay hold. Then have you rooted up the root of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>; and when the root is no more, neither will any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fruit grow.</p>
<p>9. Well: these things we are always saying and never leave off saying them: but whether our sayings do any good, the day will declare, even that day which is revealed by fire, which tries every man's work, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co003.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 3:13</font></u></a></span> which shows what lamps are bright and what are not so. Then shall he who has oil, and he who has it not, be manifest. But may none then be found destitute of the comfort; rather may all, bringing in with them abundance of mercy, and having their lamps bright, enter in together with the Bridegroom.</p>
<p>Since nothing is more fearful and full of anguish than that voice which they who departed without abundant almsgiving shall then hear the Bridegroom, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> you not.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:12</font></u></a></span> But may we never hear this voice, but rather that most pleasant and desirable one, <q>Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:34</font></u></a></span> For thus shall we live the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> life, and enjoy all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things which even pass man's understanding: unto which may we all attain, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:21"></a>1 Corinthians 12:21</h2>
<p>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
<p>Having checked the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> of those in lower rank, and having taken off the dejection which it was likely that they would feel from greater gifts having been vouchsafed to others, he humbles also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> of these latter who had received the greater gifts. He had done the same indeed in his discourse also with the former. For the statement that it was a gift and not an achievement was intended to declare this. But now he does it again even more vehemently, dwelling on the same image. For from the body in what follows, and from the unity thence arising, he proceeds to the actual comparison of the members, a thing on which they were especially seeking to be instructed. Since there was not so much power to console them in the circumstance of their being all one body, as in the conviction that in the very things wherewith they were endowed, they were not left greatly behind. And he says, <q>The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</q></p>
<p>For though the gift be less, yet is it necessary: and as when the one is absent, many functions are impeded, so also without the other there is a maim in the fullness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. And he said not, <q>will not say,</q> but <q>cannot say.</q> So that even though it wish it, though it should actually say so, it is out of the question nor is the thing consistent with nature. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> having taken the two extremes, he makes trial of his argument in them, first in respect of the hand and the eye, and secondly, in respect of the head and feet, adding force to the example.</p>
<p>For what is meaner than the foot? Or what more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> and more necessary than the head? For this, the head, more than any thing, is the man. Nevertheless, it is not of itself sufficient nor could it alone perform all things; since if this were so, our feet would be a superfluous addition.</p>
<p>2. And neither did he stop here, but seeks also another amplification, a kind of thing which he is always doing, contending not only to be on equal terms but even advancing beyond. Wherefore also he adds, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:22"></a>1 Corinthians 12:22</h2>
<p>Nay, much rather those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:23"></a>1 Corinthians 12:23</h2>
<p><q>And those parts of the body which we think to be less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>, upon these we bestow more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</q></p>
<p>In every clause adding the term <q>body,</q> and thereby both consoling the one and checking the other. <q>For I affirm not this only, </q>says he, <q>that the greater have need of the less, but that they have also much need. Since if there be any thing weak in us, if any thing dishonorable, this is both necessary and enjoys greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>.</q> And he well said, <q>which seem,</q> and, <q>which we think;</q> pointing out that the judgment arises not from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the things, but from the opinion of the many. For nothing in us is dishonorable, seeing it is God's work. Thus what in us is esteemed less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than our genital members? Nevertheless, they enjoy greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. And the very poor, even if they have the rest of the body naked, cannot endure to exhibit those members naked. Yet surely this is not the condition of things dishonorable; but it was natural for them to be despised rather than the rest. For so in a house the servant who is dishonored, so far from enjoying greater attention, has not even an equal share vouchsafed him. By the same rule likewise, if this member were dishonorable, instead of having greater privileges it ought not even to enjoy the same: whereas now it has more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> for its portion: and this too the wisdom of God has effected. For to some parts by their nature He has given not to need it: but to others, not having granted it by their nature, He has compelled us to yield it. Yet are they not therefore dishonorable. Since the animals too by their nature have a sufficiency, and need neither clothing nor shoes nor a roof, the greater part of them: yet not on this account is our body less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than they, because it needs all these things.</p>
<p>Yea rather, were one to consider accurately, these parts in question are even by nature itself both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> and necessary. Which in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself imitated, giving his judgment in their favor not from our care and from their enjoying greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, but from the very nature of the things.</p>
<p>Wherefore when he calls them <q>weak</q> and <q>less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>,</q> he uses the expression, <q>which seem:</q> but when he calls them <q>necessary,</q> he no longer adds <q>which seem,</q> but himself gives his judgment, saying, <q>they are necessary;</q> and very properly. For they are useful to procreation of children and the succession of our race. Wherefore also the Roman legislators punish them that mutilate these members and make men eunuchs, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who do injury to our common stock and affront nature herself.</p>
<p>But woe to the dissolute who bring reproach on the handy-works of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For as many are wont to curse wine on account of the drunken, and womankind on account of the unchaste; so also they account these members base because of those who use them not as they ought. But improperly. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is not allotted to the thing as a portion of its nature, but the transgression is produced by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of him that ventures on it.</p>
<p>But some suppose that the expressions, <q>the feeble members,</q> and <q>less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>,</q> and <q>necessary,</q> and <q>which enjoy more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>,</q> are used by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> of eyes and feet, and that he speaks of the eye as <q>more feeble,</q> and <q>necessary,</q> because though deficient in strength, they have the advantage in utility: but of the feet as the <q>less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>:</q> for these also receive from us great consideration.</p>
<p>3. Next, not to work out yet another amplification, he says,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:24"></a>1 Corinthians 12:24</h2>
<p><q>But our comely parts have no need:</q></p>
<p>That is, lest any should say, <q>Why what kind of speech is this, to despise the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> and pay court to the less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>?</q> <q>we do not this in contempt,</q> says he, <q>but because they 'have no need.'</q> And see how large a measure of praise he thus sets down in brief, and so hastens on: a thing most conveniently and usefully done. And neither is he content with this, but adds also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, saying, <q>But God tempered the body together, giving more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> unto that part which lacked:</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:25"></a>1 Corinthians 12:25</h2>
<p><q>That there should be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a> in the body.</q></p>
<p>Now if He tempered it together, He did not suffer that which is more uncomely to appear. For that which is mingled becomes one thing, and it does not appear what it was before: since otherwise we could not say that it was tempered. And see how he continually hastens by the defects, saying, <q>that which lacked.</q> He said not, <q>to that which is dishonorable,</q> <q>to that which is unseemly,</q> but, to that which lacked, (<q>that which lacked;</q> how? By nature,) giving more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. And wherefore? <q>That there should be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a> in the body.</q> Thus because, though they enjoyed an endless store of consolation, they nevertheless indulged grief as if they had received less than others, he signifies that they were rather <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>. For his phrase is, <q>Giving more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to that which lacked.</q></p>
<p>Next he also adds the reason, showing that with a view to their profit he both caused it to lack and more abundantly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> it. And what is the reason? <q>That there should be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>in the body.</q> (And he said not, <q>in the members,</q> but, <q>in the body.</q>) For there would indeed be a great and unfair advantage, if some members were cared for both by nature and by our forethought, others not even by either one of these. Then would they be cut off from one another, from inability to endure the connection. And when these were cut off, there would be harm done also to the rest. Do you see how he points out, that of necessity <q>greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a></q> is given to <q>that which lacks?</q> <q>For had not this been so, the injury would have become common to all,</q> says he. And the reason is, that unless these received great consideration on our part, they would have been rudely treated, as not having the help of nature: and this rude treatment would have been their ruin: their ruin would have divided the body; and the body having been divided, the other members also would have perished, which are far greater than these.</p>
<p>Do you see that the care of these latter is connected with making provision for those? For they have not their being so much in their own nature, as in their being one, by virtue of the body. Wherefore if the body perish, they profit nothing by such health as they have severally. But if the eye remain or the nose, preserving its proper function, yet when the bond of union is broken there will be no use for them ever after; whereas, suppose this remaining, and those injured, they both support themselves through it and speedily return to health.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one may say, <q>this indeed in the body has reason, that 'that which lacks has received more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>,' but among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> how may this be made out?</q> Why, among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> most especially you may see this taking place. For so they who came at the eleventh hour first received their hire; and the sheep that had wandered induced the shepherd to leave behind the ninety and nine and run after it, and when it was found, he bore and did not drive it; and the prodigal son obtained more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> than he who was approved; and the thief was crowned and proclaimed before the Apostles. And in the case of the talents also you may see this happen: in that to him that received the five talents, and to him that received two, were vouchsafed the same rewards; yea, by the very circumstance that he received the two, he was the more favored with great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a> care. Since had he been entrusted with the five, with his want of ability he would have fallen from the whole: but having received the two and fulfilled his own duty, he was thought worthy of the same with him that had gained the five, having so far the advantage, as with less labor to obtain the same crown. And yet he too was a man as well as the one that traded with the five. Nevertheless, his Master does not in any wise call him to a strict account, nor compel him to do the same with his fellow-servant, nor does he say, <q>Why can you not gain the five?</q> (though he might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> have said so,) but assigned him likewise his crown.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> these things therefore, you that are greater, trample not on the less, lest, instead of them, you injure yourselves. For when they are cut off, the whole body is destroyed. Since, what else is a body than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a> of many members? As also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself says, that <q>the body is not one member, but many.</q> If therefore this be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">essence</font></u></a> of a body, let us take care that the many continue many. Since, unless this be entirely preserved, the stroke is in the vital parts; which is the reason also why the Apostle does not require this only, their not being separated, but also their being closely united. For instance, having said, <q>that there be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">schism</font></u></a> in the body,</q> he was not content with this, but added, <q>that the members should have the same care one for another.</q> Adding this other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> also of the less enjoying more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. For not only lest they should be separated one from another has God so contrived it, but also that there may be abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> and concord. For if each man's being depends on his neighbor's safety, tell me not of the less and the more: in this case there is no more and less. While the body continues you may see the difference too, but when it perishes, no longer. And perish it will, unless the lesser parts also continue.</p>
<p>If now even the greater members will perish when the less are broken off, these ought to care in like manner for the less, and so as for themselves, inasmuch as in the safety of these the greater likewise remain. So then, should you say ten thousand times, <q>such member is dishonored and inferior,</q> still if you provide not for it in like manner as for yourself, if you neglect it as inferior, the injury will pass on to yourself. Wherefore he said not only, that <q>the members should care one for another,</q> but he added, <q>that they should have the same care one for another,</q> i.e., in like manner the small should enjoy the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a> care with great.</p>
<p>Say not then, that such is an ordinary person, but consider he is a member of that body which holds together the whole: and as the eye, so also does he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the body to be a body. For where the body is built up, there none has anything more than his neighbor: since neither does this make a body, there being one part greater and another less, but their being many and diverse. For even as thou, because you are greater, helped to make up the body, so also he, because he is less. So that his comparative deficiency, when the body is to be built up, turns out of equal value with you unto this noble contribution : yea, he avails as much as yourself. And it is evident from hence. Let there be no member greater or less, nor more and less <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>: but let all be eye or all head: will not the body perish? Every one sees it. Again, if all be inferior, the same thing will happen. So that in this respect also the less are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> equal. Yea, and if one must say something more, the purpose of the less being less is that the body may remain. So that for your sake he is less, in order that you may continue to be great. And here is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his demanding the same care from all. And having said, <q>that the members may have the same care one for another,</q> he explains <q>the same thing</q> again, by saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:26"></a>1 Corinthians 12:26</h2>
<p>5. <q>And whether one member suffers all the members suffer with it; or one member is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, all the members <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it.</q></p>
<p><q>Yea, with no other view,</q> says he, <q>did He make the care He requires common, establishing unity in so great diversity, but that of all events there might be complete communion. Because, if our care for our neighbor be the common safety, it follows also that our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and our sadness must be common.</q> Three things therefore he here demands: the not being divided but united in perfection: the having like care for another: and the considering all that happens common. And as above he says, <q>He has given more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to that part which lacked,</q> because it needs it; signifying that the very inferiority was become an introduction to greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; so here he equalizes them in respect of the care also which takes place mutually among them. For <q>therefore did he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> them to partake of greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>that they might not meet with less care.</q> And not from hence only, but also by all that befalls them, good and painful, are the members bound to one another. Thus often when a thorn is fixed in the heel, the whole body feels it and cares for it: both the back is bent and the belly and thighs are contracted, and the hands coming forth as guards and servants draw out what was so fixed, and the head stoops over it, and the eyes observe it with much care. So that even if the foot has inferiority from its inability to ascend, yet by its bringing down the head it has an equality, and is favored with the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; and especially whenever the feet are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of the head's coming down, not by favor but by their claim on it. And thus, if by being the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> it has an advantage; yet in that, being so it owes such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and care to the lesser and likewise equal sympathy: by this it indicates great equality. Since what is meaner than the heel? What more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than the head? Yet this member reaches to that, and moves them all together with itself. Again if anything is the matter with the eyes, all complain and all are idle: and neither do the feet walk nor the hands work, nor does the stomach enjoy its accustomed food; and yet the affection is of the eyes. Why do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the stomach to pine? Why keep your feet still? Why bind your hands? Because they are tied to the feet, and in an unspeakable manner the whole body suffers. For if it shared not in the suffering, it would not endure to partake of the care. Wherefore having said, <q>that the members may have the same care one for another,</q> he added, <q>whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, all the members <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it.</q> <q>And how do they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it?</q> say you. The head is crowned, and the whole man is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>. The mouth speaks, and the eyes laugh and are delighted. Yet the credit belongs not to the beauty of the eyes, but to the tongue. Again if the eyes appear beautiful, the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> is embellished: as indeed these also, when a straight nose and upright neck and other members are praised, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> and appear cheerful: and again they shed tears in great abundance over their griefs and misfortunes, though themselves continue uninjured.</p>
<p>6. Let us all then, considering these things, imitate the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of these members; let us not in any wise do the contrary, trampling on the miseries of our neighbor and envying his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things. For this is the part of madmen and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> beside themselves.  Just as he that digs out his own eye has displayed a very great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of senselessness; and he that devours his own hand exhibits a clear evidence of downright <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Now if this be the case with regard to the members, so likewise, when it happens among the brethren, it fastens on us the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a> of folly and brings on no common mischief. For as long as he shines, your comeliness also is apparent and the whole body is beautified. For not at all does he confine the beauty to himself alone, but permits you also to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. But if you extinguish him, you bring a common darkness upon the whole body, and the misfortune you cause is common to all the members: as indeed if you preserve him in brightness, you preserve the bloom of the entire body. For no man says, <q>the eye is beautiful:</q> but what? <q>such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> is beautiful.</q> And if it also be praised, it comes after the common encomium. So likewise it happens in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. I mean, if there be any celebrated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, the community reaps the good report of it. For the enemies are not apt to divide the praises, but connect them together. And if any be brilliant in speech, they do not praise him alone but likewise the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. For they do not say only, <q>such a one is a wonderful man,</q> but what? <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a> have a wonderful teacher:</q> and so they make the possession common.</p>
<p>7. And now let me ask, do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathens</font></u></a> bind together, and do you divide and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with your own body, and withstand your own members? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that this overturns all? For even a <q>kingdom,</q> says he, <q>divided against itself shall not stand.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:25</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>But nothing so divides and separates as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> and jealousy, that grievous disease, and exempt from all pardon, and in some respect worse than <q>the root of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:12</font></u></a></span> For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> is then pleased when himself has received: but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> is then pleased, when another has failed to receive, not when himself has received. For he thinks the misfortunes of others a benefit to himself, rather than prosperity; going about a common enemy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>, and smiting the members of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, than which what can be more akin to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>? A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, not of any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>: but thou being a man enviest men, and withstandest what is of your own tribe and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>, which not even a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a> does. And what pardon shall you obtain, what excuse? Trembling and turning pale at sight of a brother in prosperity, when you ought to crown yourself and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> and exult.</p>
<p>If indeed you wish to emulate him, I forbid not that: emulate, but with a view to be like him who is approved: not in order to depress him but that you may reach the same lofty point, that you may display the same excellence. This is wholesome rivalry, imitation without contention: not to grieve at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things of others but to be vexed at our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>: the contrary to which is the result of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. For neglecting its own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, it pines away at the good fortune of other men. And thus the poor is not so vexed by his own poverty as by the plenty of his neighbor; than which what can be more grievous? Yea, in this respect the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, as I before said, is worse than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a>; the one rejoicing at some acquisition of his own, while the other finds his delight in some one else failing to receive.</p>
<p>Wherefore I beseech you, leaving this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> way, to change to a proper emulation, (for it is a violent thing, this kind of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>, and hotter than any fire,) and to win thereby mighty blessings. Thus also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> used to guide those of Jewish origin unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, saying, <q>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and may save some of them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom011.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 11:14</font></u></a></span> For he whose emulation is like what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> wished for does not pine when he sees the other in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a>, but when he sees himself left behind: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> not so, but at the sight of another's prosperity. And he is a kind of drone, injuring other men's labors; and himself never anxious to rise, but weeping when he sees another rising, and doing every thing to throw him down. To what then might one compare this passion? It seems to me to be like as if a sluggish ass and heavy with abundance of flesh, being yoked with a winged courser, should neither himself be willing to rise, and should attempt to drag the other down by the weight of his carcass. For so this man takes no thought nor anxiety to be himself rid of this deep slumber, but does every thing to supplant and throw down him that is flying towards heaven, becoming an exact emulator of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: since he too, seeing man in paradise, sought not to change his own condition, but to cast him out of paradise. And again, seeing him seated in heaven and the rest hastening there, he holds to the same plan, supplanting them who are hastening there and hereby heaping up the furnace more abundantly for himself. For in every instance this happens: both he that is envied, if he be vigilant, becoming more eminent; and he that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, accumulating to himself more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. Thus also Joseph became eminent, thus <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01003a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Aaron</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>: the conspiracy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> caused God once and again to give His suffrage for him, and was the occasion of the rod's budding. Thus Jacob attained his abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and all those other blessings. Thus the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> pierce themselves through with ten thousand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> as we do all these things, let us flee such emulation. For wherefore, tell me, do you envy? Because your brother has received spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>? And from whom did he receive it? Answer me. Was it not from God? Clearly then He is the object of the enmity to Which you are committing yourself, He the bestower of the gift. Do you see which way the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is tending, and with what sort of a point it is crowning the heap of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>; and how deep the pit of vengeance which it is digging for you?</p>
<p>Let us flee it, then, beloved, and neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> others, nor fail to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for our enviers and do all we can to extinguish their passion: neither let us feel as the unthinking do who being minded to exact punishment of them, do all in their power to light up their flame. But let not us do so; rather let us weep for them and lament. For they are the injured <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, having continual worm gnawing through their heart, and collecting a fountain of poison more bitter than any gall. Come now, let us beseech the merciful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, both to change their state of feeling and that we may never fall into that disease: since heaven is indeed inaccessible to him that has this wasting sore, and before heaven too, even this present life is not worth living in. For not so thoroughly are timber and wool wont to be eaten through by moth and worm abiding therein, as does the fever of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> devour the very bones of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> and destroy all self-command in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>In order then that we may deliver both ourselves and others from these innumerable woes, let us expel from within us this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fever, this that is more grievous than any gangrene: that having regained spiritual strength, we may both finish the present course and obtain the future crowns; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:27"></a>1 Corinthians 12:27</h2>
<p>Now you are the body of Christ and severally members thereof.</p>
<p>For lest any should say, <q>What is the example of the body to us? Since the body is a slave to nature but our good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> are of choice;</q> he applies it to our own concerns; and to signify that we ought to have the same concord of design as they have from nature, he says, <q>Now you are the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> But if our body ought not to be divided, much less the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and so much less as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> is more powerful than nature.</p>
<p> But what is the expression, <q>severally?</q> <q>So far at least as appertains to you; and so far as naturally a part should be built up from you.</q> For because he had said, <q>the body,</q> whereas the whole body was not the Corinthian Church, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> in every part of the world, therefore he said, <q>severally:</q> i.e., the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> among you is a part of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> existing every where and of the body which is made up of all the Churches: so that not only with yourselves alone, but also with the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> throughout the world, you ought to be at peace, if at least ye be members of the whole body.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:28"></a>1 Corinthians 12:28</h2>
<p>2. <q>And God has set some in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>: first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>, secondly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, thirdly teachers, then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues.</q></p>
<p>Thus what I spoke of before, this also he now does. Because they thought highly of themselves in respect of the tongues he sets it last every where. For the terms, <q>first</q> and <q>secondly,</q> are not used by him here at random, but in order by enumeration to point out the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> and the inferior. Wherefore also he set the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a> first who had all the gifts in themselves. And he said not, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has set certain in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a></q> simply, <q>or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>,</q> but he employs <q>first, second,</q> and <q>third,</q> signifying that same thing which I told you of.</p>
<p><q>Secondly, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>.</q> For they used to prophesy, as the daughters of Philip, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01200a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Agabus</font></u></a>, as these very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> among the Corinthians, of whom he says, <q>Let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> speak, two or three.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co014.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 14:29</font></u></a></span> And writing also to Timothy, he said, <q>Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:14</font></u></a></span> And they were much more many that prophesied. And if Christ says, <q>The Law and the Prophets prophesied until John,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat011.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 11:13</font></u></a></span> He says it of those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> who before proclaimed His coming.</p>
<p><q>Thirdly, teachers.</q> For he that prophesies speaks all things from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>; but he that teaches sometimes discourses also out of his own mind. Wherefore also he said, <q>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, especially they who labor in the word and in teaching:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:17</font></u></a></span> whereas he that speaks all things by the Spirit does not labor. This accordingly is the reason why he set him after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, because the one is wholly a gift but the other is also man's labor. For he speaks many things of his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, agreeing however with the sacred Scriptures.</p>
<p>3. <q>Then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, then gifts of healings.</q>  Do you see how he again divides the healings from the power, which also he did before. For the power is more than the healing: since he that has power both punishes and heals, but he that has the gift of healings does cures only. And observe how excellent the order he made use of, when he set the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and the healings. For above when he said, <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>,</q> he spoke, not setting them in order, but indifferently. Here, on the other hand, he sets a first and a second rank. Wherefore then does he set <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> first? Because even in the old covenant the matter has this order. For example, when Isaiah was discoursing with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and exhibiting a demonstration of the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and bringing forward the evidence of the worthlessness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, he stated this also as the greater evidence of his divinity, his foretelling things to come. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa041.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 41:22-23</font></u></a></span> And Christ Himself after working so many signs says that this was no small sign of His divinity: and continually adds, <q>But these things have I told you, that when it has come to pass, you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that I am He.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh013.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 13:19</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">14:29</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">16:4</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>Well then; the gifts of healing are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> inferior to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. But why likewise to teaching?</q> Because it is not the same thing to declare the word of preaching and sow <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a> in the hearts of the hearers, as it is to work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: since these are done merely for the sake of that. When therefore any one teaches both by word and life, he is greater than all. For those he calls emphatically teachers, who both teach by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and instruct in word. For instance: this made the Apostles themselves to become Apostles. And those gifts certain others also, of no great worth, received in the beginning, as they who said, <q>Lord, did we not prophesy by Your Name, and do mighty works?</q> and after this were told, <q>I never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> you; depart from Me, you that work iniquity.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:22</font></u></a></span> But this twofold mode of teaching, I mean that by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and by words, no bad man would ever undertake. As to his setting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> first marvel not at it. For he is not speaking of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> simply, but of those who by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> do also teach and say every thing to the common benefit: which in proceeding he makes more clear to us.</p>
<p><q>Helps, governments.</q> What is, <q>helps?</q> To support the weak. Is this then a gift, tell me? In the first place, this too is of the Gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, aptness for a patron's office ; the dispensing spiritual things; besides which he calls many even of our own good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, <q>gifts;</q> not meaning us to lose heart, but showing that in every case we need God's help, and preparing them to be thankful, and thereby making them more forward and stirring up their minds.</p>
<p><q>Divers kind of tongues.</q> Do you see where he has set this gift, and how he every where assigns it the last rank?</p>
<p>4. Further, since again by this catalogue he had pointed out a great difference, and stirred up the afore-mentioned distemper of those that had lesser gifts, he darts upon them in what follows with great vehemence, because he had already given them those many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of their not being left much inferior. What I mean is; because it was likely that on hearing these things they would say, <q>And why were we not all made Apostles?</q>— whereas above he had made use of a more soothing tone of discourse, proving at length the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of this result, even from the image of the body; for <q>the body,</q> says he, <q>is not one member;</q> and again, <q>but if all were one member, where were the body?</q> and from the fact that they were given for use; for to each one is given <q>the manifestation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>to profit withal:</q> and from all being watered from the same Spirit: and from what is bestowed being a free gift and not a debt; <q>for there are,</q> says he, <q>diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit:</q> and from the manifestation of the Spirit being made alike through all; for <q>to each one,</q> says he, <q>is given the manifestation through the Spirit:</q> and from the fact that these things were shaped according to the pleasure of the Spirit and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; <q>for all these,</q> says he, <q>works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will:</q> and, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased Him:</q> and from the inferior members also being necessary; <q>for those which seem,</q> says he, <q>to be more feeble are necessary:</q> from their being alike necessary, in that they from the greater too needing the less: <q>for the head,</q> says he, <q>cannot say to the feet, I have no need of you:</q> from these latter enjoying even more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; for <q>to that which lacks,</q> says he, <q>He has given more abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>:</q> from the care of them being common and equal; for <q>for all the members have the same care one for another:</q> and from there being one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and one grief of them all; for <q>whether,</q> says he, <q>one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, all the members <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with it:</q>— whereas, I say, he had above exhorted them by these topics, here and henceforth he uses language so as to bear them down and rebuke them. For, as I said, it behooves us neither always to exhort people nor always to silence them. Therefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself, because he at length exhorted them, does henceforth vehemently attack them, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:29"></a>1 Corinthians 12:29</h2>
<p><q>Are all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">apostles</font></u></a>? Are all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>? Have all gifts of healing?</q></p>
<p>And he does not stop at the first and the second gift, but proceeds to the last, either meaning this that all cannot be all things, (even as he there says, <q>if all were one member, where were the body?</q>) or establishing some other point also along with these, which may tell in the way of consolation again. What then is this? His signifying that even the lesser gifts are contended for equally with the greater, from the circumstance that not even these were given absolutely to all? For <q>why,</q> says he, <q>do you grieve that you have not gifts of healing? Consider that what you have, even though it be less, is oftentimes not possessed by him that has the greater.</q> Wherefore he says,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:30"></a>1 Corinthians 12:30</h2>
<p><q>Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</q></p>
<p>For even as the great gifts God has not vouchsafed all to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but to some this, and to others that, so also did He in respect of the less, not proposing these either to all. And this He did, procuring thereby abundant harmony and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, that each one standing in need of the other might be brought close to his brother. This economy He established also in the arts, this also in the elements, this also in the plants, and in our members, and absolutely in all things.</p>
<p>5. Then he subjoins further the most powerful consolation, and sufficient to recover them and quiet their vexed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. And what is this?</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-12:31"></a>1 Corinthians 12:31</h2>
<p><q>Desire earnestly,</q> says he, <q>the better gifts. And a still more excellent way show I unto you.</q></p>
<p>Now by saying this, he gently hinted that they were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of their own receiving the lesser gifts, and had it in their power, if they would, to receive the greater. For when he says, <q>desire earnestly,</q> he demands from them all diligence and desire for spiritual things. And he said not, the greater gifts, but <q>the better,</q> i.e., the more useful, those which would profit. And what he means is this: <q>continue to desire gifts; and I point out to you a fountain of gifts.</q> For neither did he say, <q>a gift,</q> but <q>a way,</q> that he might the more extol that which he intends to mention. As if he said, It is not one, or two, or three gifts that I point out to you, but one way which leads to all these : and not merely a way, but both <q>a more excellent way</q> and one that is open in common to all. For not as the gifts are vouchsafed, to some these, to others those, but not all to all; so also in this case: but it is an universal gift. Wherefore also he invites all to it. <q>Desire earnestly,</q> says he, <q>the better gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way;</q> meaning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards our neighbor.</p>
<p>Then intending to proceed to the discourse concerning it and the encomium of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, he first lowers these by comparison with it, intimating that they are nothing without it; very considerately.  For if he had at once discoursed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and having said, <q>I show unto you a way,</q> had added, <q>but this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>,</q> and had not conducted his discourse by way of comparison; some might possibly have scoffed at what was said, not understanding clearly the force of the thing spoken of but still gaping after these. Wherefore he does not at once unfold it, but first excites the hearer by the promise, and says, <q>I show unto you a more excellent way,</q> and so having led him to desire it, he does not even thus straightway proceed to it, but augmenting still further and extending their desire, he discourses first of these very things, and shows that without it they are nothing; reducing them to the greatest necessity of loving one another; seeing also that from neglect of it sprang that which caused all their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. So that in this respect also it might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> appear great, if the gifts not only brought them not together, but divided them even when united: but this, when many were so divided, would reunite them by virtue of its own and make them one body. This however he does not say at once, but what they chiefly longed for, that he sets down; as that the thing was a gift and a most excellent way to all the gifts. So that, even if you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> your brother on the score of friendship, yet for the sake of obtaining a better sign and an abundant gift, cherish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>6. And see whence he first begins; from that which was marvellous in their eyes and great, the gift of tongues. And in bringing forward that gift, he mentions it not just in the degree they had it in, but far more. For he did not say, <q>if I speak with tongues,</q> but,</p></div>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:1"></a>1 Corinthians 14:1</h2>
<p>Follow after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.</p>
<p>Thus, inasmuch as he had with exactness rehearsed unto them all the excellence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, he exhorts them in what follows, with alacrity to lay hold of it. Wherefore also he said, <q>Follow after:</q> for he that is in chase beholds that only which is chased, and towards that he strains himself, and leaves not off until he lay hold of it. He that is in chase, when by himself he cannot, by those that are before him he does overtake the fugitive, beseeching those who are near with much eagerness to seize and keep it so seized for him until he shall come up. This then let us also do. When of ourselves we do not reach unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, let us bid them that are near her to hold her, till we come up with her, and when we have apprehended, no more let her go, that she may not again escape us. For continually she springs away from us, because we use her not as we ought, but prefer all things unto her. Therefore we ought to make every effort, so as perfectly to retain her. For if this be done, we require not henceforth much labor, nay rather scarce any; but taking our ease, and keeping holiday , we shall march on in the narrow path of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Wherefore he says, <q>Follow after her.</q></p>
<p>Then that they might not suppose that for no other end he brought in the discourse of charity, except that he might extinguish the gifts, he subjoins as follows;</p>
<p><q>Yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:2"></a>1 Corinthians 14:2</h2>
<p><q>For he that speaks in a tongue, speaks not unto men, but unto God: for no man understands; but in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a> he speaks <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:3"></a>1 Corinthians 14:3</h2>
<p><q>But he that prophesies speaks unto men edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</q></p>
<p>At this point he makes a comparison between the gifts, and lowers that of the tongues, showing it to be neither altogether useless, nor very profitable by itself. For in fact they were greatly puffed up on account of this, because the gift was considered to be a great one. And it was thought great because the Apostles received it first, and with so great display; it was not however therefore to be esteemed above all the others. Wherefore then did the Apostles receive it before the rest? Because they were to go abroad every where. And as in the time of building the tower the one tongue was divided into many; so then the many tongues frequently met in one man, and the same person used to discourse both in the Persian, and the Roman, and the Indian, and many other tongues, the Spirit sounding within him: and the gift was called the gift of tongues because he could all at once speak various languages. See accordingly how he both depresses and elevates it. Thus, by saying, <q>He that speaks with tongues, speaks not unto men, but unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, for no man understands,</q> he depressed it, implying that the profit of it was not great; but by adding, <q>but in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a> he speaks <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a></q> he again elevated it, that it might not seem to be superfluous and useless and given in vain.</p>
<p><q>But he that prophesies speaks unto men edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</q></p>
<p>Do you see by what he signifies the choice nature of this gift? I.e., by the common benefit? And how every where he gives the higher <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to that which tends to the profit of the many? For do not the former speak unto men also? Tell me. But not so much <q>edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</q> So that the being powered by the Spirit is common to both, as well to him that prophesies, as to him that speaks with tongues; but in this, the one (he, I mean, who prophesies) has the advantage in that he is also profitable unto the hearers. For they who with tongues were not understood by them that had not the gift.</p>
<p>What then? Did they edify no man? <q>Yes,</q> says he, <q>themselves alone:</q> wherefore also he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:4"></a>1 Corinthians 14:4</h2>
<p><q>He that speaks in tongue edifies himself.</q></p>
<p>And how, if he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what he says? Why, for the present, he is speaking of them who understand what they say—understand it themselves, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not how to render it unto others.</p>
<p><q>But he that prophesies edifies the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> Now as great as is the difference between a single person and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, so great is the interval between these two. Do you see his wisdom, how he does not thrust out the gift and make nothing of it, but signifies it to have some advantage, small though it be, and such as to suffice the possessor only?</p>
<p>2. Next, lest they should suppose that in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> to them he depresses the tongues, (for the more part had this gift,) to correct their suspicion he says,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:5"></a>1 Corinthians 14:5</h2>
<p><q>I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that you should prophesy: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> may receive edifying.</q></p>
<p>But <q>rather</q> and <q>greater,</q> do not mark opposition, but superiority. So that hence also it is evident that he is not disparaging the gift, but leading them to better things, displaying both his carefulness on their behalf, and a spirit free from all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>. For neither did he say, <q>I would that two or three,</q> but, <q>that you all spoke with tongues</q> and not this only, but also, <q>that you prophesied;</q> and this rather than that; <q>for greater is he that prophesies.</q> For since he has established and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> it, he next proceeds also to assert it; not however simply, but with a qualification. Accordingly he adds, <q>except he interpret;</q> since if he be able to do this, I mean the interpreting, <q>he has become equal unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>,</q> so he speaks, <q>because then there are many who reap the advantage of it;</q> a thing to be especially observed, how this throughout, before all else, is his object,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:6"></a>1 Corinthians 14:6</h2>
<p><q>But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</q></p>
<p><q>And why speak I,</q> says he, <q>of the rest? Nay, let the person who speaks with tongues be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: for not even so will any good come to the hearers.</q> And these things he says to signify that he is seeking their profit, not bearing any grudge against them that have the gift; since not even in his own person does he shrink from pointing out its unprofitableness. And indeed it is his constant way to work out the disagreeable topics in his own person: as in the beginning of the Epistle he said, <q>Who then is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>? And who is Apollos? And who is Cephas?</q> This same then he does also here, saying, <q>Not even I shall profit you, except I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of prophesying, or of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, or of teaching.</q> And what he means is, <q>if I say not somewhat that can be made intelligible to you and that may be clear, but merely make display of my having the gift of tongues;— tongues which you do not understand, you will go away with no sort of profit. For how should you profit by a voice which you understand not?</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:7"></a>1 Corinthians 14:7</h2>
<p>[3] <q>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> what is piped?</q></p>
<p><q>And why do I say,</q> says he, that in our case this is unprofitable, and that only useful which is clear and easy to be apprehended by the hearers? Since even in musical instruments without life one may see this: for whether it be pipe or harp, yet if it be struck or blown confusedly and unskilfully, without proper cadence or harmony, it will captivate none of the hearers. For even in these inarticulate sounds there is need of some distinctness: and if you strike not or breathe into the pipe according to art, you have done nothing. Now if from things without life we require so much distinctness, and harmony, and appropriateness, and into those inarticulate sounds we strive and contend to infuse so much meaning, much more in men indued with life and reason, and in spiritual gifts, ought one to make significancy an object.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:8"></a>1 Corinthians 14:8</h2>
<p><q>For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>?</q></p>
<p>Thus from things merely ornamental he carries on his argument to those which are more necessary and useful; and says that not in the harp alone, but in the trumpet also one may see this effect produced. For in that also there are certain measures; and they give out at one time a warlike note, and at another one that is not so; and again sometimes it leads out to line of battle and at others recalls from it: and unless one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this, there is great danger. Which is just what he means, and the mischief of it what he is manifesting, when he says, <q>who shall prepare himself for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>?</q> So then, if it have not this quality, it is the ruin of all. <q>And what is this to us,</q> says one? Truly it concerns you very especially; wherefore also he adds,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:9"></a>1 Corinthians 14:9</h2>
<p><q>So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue, speech easy to be understood, you will be speaking into the air:</q> i.e., calling to nobody, speaking unto no one. Thus every where he shows its unprofitableness.</p>
<p>4. <q>But if it be unprofitable, why was it given?</q> says one. So as to be useful to him that has received it. But if it is to be so to others also, there must be added interpretation. Now this he says, bringing them near to one another; that if a person himself have not the gift of interpretation, he may take unto him another that has it, and make his own gift useful through him. Wherefore he every where points out its imperfection, that so he may bind them together. Any how, he that accounts it to be sufficient for itself, does not so much commend it as disparage it, not suffering it to shine brightly by the interpretation. For excellent indeed and necessary is the gift, but it is so when it has one to explain what is spoken. Since the finger too is a necessary thing, but when you separate it from the other members, it will not be equally useful: and the trumpet is necessary, but when it sounds at random, it is rather an annoyance. Yea, neither shall any art come to light, without matter subject to it; nor is matter put into shape, if no form be assigned to it. Suppose then the voice to be as the subject-matter, but the distinctness as that form, which not being present, there will be no use in the material.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:10"></a>1 Corinthians 14:10</h2>
<p><q>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification:</q> i.e., so many tongues, so many voices of Scythians, Thracians, Romans, Persians, Moors, Indians, Egyptians, innumerable other nations.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:11"></a>1 Corinthians 14:11</h2>
<p><q>If then I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian.</q> <q>For suppose not,</q> says he, <q>that this happens only in our case; rather in all one may see this taking place: so that I do not say this to disparage the voice, but to signify that to me it is useless, as long as it is not intelligible.</q> Next, that he may not render the accusation unpalatable, he makes his charge alike for the two, saying, <q>He shall be unto me a barbarian, and I to him.</q> Not from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the voice, but from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>. Do you see how little by little he draws men to that which is akin to the subject. Which is his use to do, to fetch his examples from afar, and to end with what more properly belongs to the matter. For having spoken of a pipe and harp, wherein is much that is inferior and unprofitable, he comes to the trumpet, a thing more useful; next, from that he proceeds to the very voice itself. So also before, when he was discoursing to show that it was not forbidden the Apostles to receive, beginning first with husbandmen, and shepherds, and soldiers, then he brought the discourse on to that which is nearer to the subject, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> in the old covenant.</p>
<p>But do thou, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, consider, how every where he has given diligence to free the gift from censure, and to bring round the charge to the receivers of it. For he said not, <q>I shall be a barbarian,</q> but, <q>unto him that speaks, a barbarian.</q> And again, he did not say, <q>he that speaks shall be a barbarian,</q> but <q>he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto me. </q></p>
<p>5. <q>What then must be done?</q> says he. Why, so far from disparaging, one ought to recommend and to teach it; as indeed himself also does. Since after he had accused and rebuked it and shown its unprofitableness, he proceeds to counsel them; saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:12"></a>1 Corinthians 14:12</h2>
<p><q>So also ye, since as you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a> of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound unto the edifying of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Do you see his aim every where, how he looks to one thing continually and in all cases, the general utility, the profiting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; laying this down as a kind of rule? And he did not say, <q>that you may obtain the gifts</q> but, <q>that you may abound,</q> i.e., that you may even possess them in great plenitude. Thus, so far am I from wishing you not to possess them, that I even wish you to abound in them, only so that you handle them with a view to the common advantage. And how is this to be done? This he adds, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:13"></a>1 Corinthians 14:13</h2>
<p><q>Wherefore let him that speaks in a tongue <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> that he may interpret.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:14"></a>1 Corinthians 14:14</h2>
<p><q>For if I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> in a tongue, my spirit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, but my understanding is unfruitful.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:15"></a>1 Corinthians 14:15</h2>
<p><q>What is it then? I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with the spirit, and I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</q></p>
<p>Here he shows that it is in their power to obtain the gift. For, <q>let him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>,</q> says he, i.e., <q>let him contribute his own part,</q> since if you ask diligently, you will surely receive. Ask accordingly not to have the gift of tongue only, but also of interpretation, that you may become useful unto all, and not shut up your gift in yourself alone. <q>For if I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> in a tongue,</q> says he, <q>my spirit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, but my understanding is unfruitful.</q> Do you see how by degrees bringing his argument to a point, he signifies that not to others only is such an one useless, but also to himself; if at least <q>his understanding is unfruitful?</q> For if a man should speak only in the Persian, or any other foreign tongue, and not understand what he says, then of course to himself also will he be thenceforth a barbarian, not to another only, from not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> the meaning of the sound. For there were of old many who had also a gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, together with a tongue; and they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>, and the tongue spoke, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a> either in the Persian or Latin language , but their understanding <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not what was spoken. Wherefore also he said, <q>If I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> in a tongue, my spirit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>,</q> i.e., the gift which is given me and which moves my tongue, <q>but my understanding is unfruitful.</q></p>
<p>What then may that be which is best in itself, and does good? And how ought one to act, or what request of God? To <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, <q>both with the spirit,</q> i.e., the gift, and <q>with the understanding.</q> Wherefore also he said, <q>I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with the spirit, and I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</q></p>
<p>6. He signifies the same thing here also, that both the tongue may speak, and the understanding may not be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the things spoken. For except this be so, there will also be another confusion.</p>

<p><q>Else,</q> says he, <q>if you bless with the spirit, how shall he that fills the place of the unlearned say the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a> at your giving of thanks, seeing he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not what you say.</q></p>

<p><q>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</q></p>
<p>Observe how again here he brings his stone to the plumb-line, every where seeking the edification of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Now by the <q>unlearned</q> he means the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laymen</font></u></a>, and signifies that he also suffers no little loss when he is unable to say the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>. And what he says is this: <q>if you shall bless in a barbarian tongue, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what you say, nor able to interpret, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">layman</font></u></a> cannot respond the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>. For not hearing the words, 'forever and ever,' which are at the end , he does not say the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</q> Then again, comforting him concerning this, that he might not seem to hold the gift too cheap; the same kind of remark as he made above, that <q>he speaks <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>,</q> and <q>speaks unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and <q>edifies himself,</q> and <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a> with the spirit,</q> intending no little comfort from these things, this also he utters here, saying, <q>for thou indeed givest thanks well,</q> since you speak being moved by the Spirit: but the other hearing nothing nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what is said, stands there, receiving no great advantage by it.</p>
<p>7. Further, because he had run down the possessors of this gift, as though they had no such great thing; that he might not seem to hold them cheap, as being himself destitute of it, see what he says:</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:18"></a>1 Corinthians 14:18</h2>
<p><q>I thank <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, speaking with tongues more than ye all.</q></p>
<p>And this he does also in another place intending, namely, to take away the advantages of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judaism</font></u></a> and to show that henceforth they are nothing, he begins by declaring that himself had been endowed with them, yea, and that in very great excess; and then he calls them <q>loss,</q> thus saying, <q>If any man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I more: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> the eighth day, of the stock of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisee</font></u></a>; as touching <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuting</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; as touching the righteousness which is the law, found blameless.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:4-7</font></u></a></span> And then, having signified himself to have the advantage of all, he says, <q>Howbeit what things were gain to me, those have I counted loss for Christ.</q> So also he does here, saying, <q>I speak with tongues more than ye all.</q> Do not ye therefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> as though ye only had the gift. For I also possess it, yea more than ye.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:19"></a>1 Corinthians 14:19</h2>
<p><q>Howbeit in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also.</q></p>
<p>What is that, <q>speak with my understanding, that I might instruct others also?</q> <q>Understanding what I say,</q> and <q>words which I can both interpret to others, and speak intelligently, and teach the hearers.</q> <q>Than ten thousand words in a tongue.</q> Wherefore? <q>That I may instruct others,</q> says he. For the one has but display only; the other, great utility: this being what he everywhere seeks, I mean the common profit. And yet the gift of tongues was strange, but that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> familiar and ancient and heretofore given to many; this on the contrary then first given: howbeit it was not much cared for by him. Wherefore neither did he employ it; not because he had it not, but because he always sought the more profitable things: being as he was free from all vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and considering one thing only, how he might render the hearers better.</p>
<p>8. And here is the reason of the faculty he had of looking to the expedient both to himself and to others: viz. because he was free from vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Since he assuredly that is enslaved by it, so far from discerning what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> to others, will not even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> his own.</p>
<p>Such was Simon, who, because he looked to vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, did not even see his own advantage. Such also were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, who because of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a> their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. Hence also did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a> spring, and by this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a> excite themselves, and make shipwreck in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false doctrines</font></u></a>. And observe the perverseness of this passion: how because of it some of them also made themselves poor, others were eager for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. So potent is its tyranny that it prevails even in direct contraries. Thus one man is vain of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03637d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">chastity</font></u></a>, and contrariwise another of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a>; and this man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>, and another of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>; so of luxury and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>, modesty and rashness, riches and poverty. I say poverty: since some of them that were with out, when it was in their power to receive, for admiration's sake forbore to receive. But not so the Apostles: that they were pure from vainglory, they showed by their doings: in that, when some were calling them Gods and were ready to sacrifice-unto them oxen with garlands, they did not merely just forbid what was doing, but they even rent their clothes. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act014.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 14:13-14</font></u></a></span> And after they had set the lame man upright, when all with open mouths were gazing at them, they said, <q>Why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power we had made this man to walk ?</q> And those, among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> who admired poverty, chose to themselves a state of poverty: but these among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who despised poverty and gave praise to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. And these, if they received anything, ministered to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">needy</font></u></a>. Thus, not vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> but benevolence, was the motive of all they did. But those quite the reverse; as enemies and pests of our common nature, and no otherwise, did they such things. Thus one sunk all his goods in the sea for no good purpose, imitating fools and madmen: and another let all his land go to sheep common. Thus they did every thing for vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. But not so the Apostles; rather they both received what was given them, and distributed to the needy with so great liberality that they even lived in continual hunger. But if they had been enamored of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, they would not have practiced this, the receiving and distributing, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of some suspicion arising against them. For he who throws away his own for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, will much more refuse to receive the things of others, that he may not be accounted to stand in need of others nor incur any suspicion. But these you see both ministering to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, and themselves begging for them. So <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> were they more loving than any fathers.</p>
<p>9. And observe also their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, how moderate and freed from all vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Thus: <q>Having</q> says he, food and covering, let us therewith be content. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:8</font></u></a></span> Not like him of Sinope , who clothed in rags and living in a cask to no good end, astonished many, but profited none: whereas <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> did none of these things; (for neither had he an eye to ostentation;) but was both clothed in ordinary apparel with all decency, and lived in a house continually, and displayed all exactness in the practice of all other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; which the cynic despised, living impurely and publicly disgracing himself, and dragged away by his mad passion for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. For if any one ask the reason of his living in a cask, he will find no other but vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> alone. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also paid rent for the house wherein he abode at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rome</font></u></a>. Although he who was able to do things far severer, could much more have had strength for this. But he looked not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, that savage monster, that fearful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>, that pest of the world, that poisonous viper. Since, as that animal tears through the womb of her parent with her teeth, so also this passion tears in pieces him that begets it.</p>
<p>10. By what means then may one find a remedy for this manifold distemper? By bringing forward those that have trodden it under foot, and with an eye to their image so ordering one's own life. For so the patriarch <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>.— nay, let none accuse me of tautology if I often make mention of him, and on all occasions: this being that which most of all shows him wonderful, and deprives them that refuse to imitate him of all excuse. For, if we exhibit one doing well in this particular, and another in that, some one might say that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is hardly to be attained; for that it is scarcely possible to succeed in all those things together, whereof each one of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> has performed only a part. But when one and the same person is found to possess all, what excuse will they have, who after the law and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> are not able to attain unto the same measure with them that were before the law and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>? How then did this Patriarch overcome and subdue this monster, when he had a dispute with his nephew? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen013.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 13:8</font></u></a></span> For so it was, that coming off worst and losing the first share, he was not vexed. But ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that in such matters the shame is worse than the loss to the vulgar-minded, and particularly when a person having all in his own power, as he had then, and having been the first to give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, was not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> in return. Nevertheless, none of these things vexed him, but he was content to receive the second place, and when wronged by the young man, himself old, an uncle by a nephew, he was not indignant nor took it ill, but loved him equally and ministered to him. Again, having been victorious in that great and terrible fight, and having mightily put to flight the Barbarians <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen014.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 14</font></u></a></span> he does not add show to victory, nor erect a trophy.  For he wished to save only, not to exhibit himself. Again, he entertained strangers, yet did he not here act vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gloriously</font></u></a>, but himself both ran to them and bowed down to them, not as though he were giving, but receiving a benefit, and he calls them lords, without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> who they are who have come to him, and presents his wife in the place of a handmaiden. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen018.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 18</font></u></a></span> And in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a> too before this, when he had appeared so extraordinary a person, and had received back this very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, his wife, and had enjoyed so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen012.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 12</font></u></a></span> he shows it to no man. And though the inhabitants of the place called him prince, he himself even laid down the price of the sepulchre. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen023.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 23:6</font></u></a></span> And when he sent to betroth a wife for his son, he gave no command to speak in high and dignified terms of him, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen024.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 24</font></u></a></span> but merely to bring the bride.</p>
<p>11. Will you examine also the conduct of those under <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, when from every side great was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of the teaching flowing round them, and will you see then also this passion cast out? Consider, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, this same Apostle who speaks these things, how he ever ascribes the whole to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, how of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> he makes mention continually, but of his good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> never, unless perchance it should be needful to correct the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>; and even if he be compelled to do this, he calls the matter folly, and yields the first place to Peter, and is not ashamed to labor with Priscilla and Aquila, and every where he is eager to show himself lowly, not swaggering in the market place, nor carrying crowds with him, but setting himself down among the obscure. Wherefore also he said, <q>but his bodily presence is weak.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co010.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 10:10</font></u></a></span> i.e., easy to be despised, and not at all accompanied with display. And again, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> that you do no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, not that we may appear approved.</q> And what marvel if he despise this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>? Seeing that he despises the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of heaven, and the kingdom, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, for that which was pleasing unto Christ: for he wishes himself to be accursed from Christ for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. For if he says that he is willing to suffer this for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews'</font></u></a> sake, he says it on this account that none of those without understanding might think to take to himself the promises made to them. If therefore he were ready to pass by those things, what marvel is it if he despise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> things?</p>
<p>12. But the men of our time are overwhelmed by all things, not by desire of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> only, but also, on the other hand, by insult and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of dishonor. Thus, should any one praise, it would puff you up, and if he blame, it would cast you down. And as weak bodies are by common accidents injured, so also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> which grovel on earth. For such not poverty alone, but even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> destroys, not grief only, but likewise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, and prosperity more than adversity. For poverty compels to be wise, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> leads on oftentimes into some great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. And as men in a fever are hard to be pleased in any thing, so also they that are depraved in mind on every side receive hurt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> therefore these things, let us not shun poverty, let us not admire riches: but prepare our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to be sufficient for all estates. For so any one building an house does not consider how neither rain may descend, nor sunbeam light on it, (for this were impossible,) but how it may be made capable of enduring all. And he again that builds a ship does not fashion and design any thing to keep waves from breaking against it, or any tempest from rising in the sea: (for this too were impossible:) but that the sides of the ship may be ready to meet all. And again, he that cares for the body does not look to this that there may be no inequality in the temperature, but that the body may easily endure all these things. So accordingly let us act in respect of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and neither be anxious to fly poverty nor to become rich, but to regulate each of them for our own safety.</p>
<p>Wherefore, letting alone these things, let us render our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> meet both for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and poverty. For although no calamity, such as man is subject to, befall, which is for the most part impossible, even thus, better is he that seeks not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> how to bear all things easily than he that is always rich. And why? First, such an one has his safety from within, but the other from without. And as he is a better soldier who trusts to his bodily powers and skill in fighting, than he that has his strength in his armor only; so he that relies on his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, compared with him that is fenced in by his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, is inferior. Secondly, because even if he do not fall into poverty, it is impossible that he should be without trouble. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> has many storms and troubles; but not so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but pleasure only and safety. Yea, and it puts a man out of the reach of them that lay snares for him, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> quite the contrary, rendering him easy to be attacked and taken. And as among animals, stags and hares are of all most easily taken through their natural timidity, but the wild boar, and the bull, and the lion, would not easily fall in the way of the liers-in-wait; just so one may see in the case of the rich, and of them that live voluntarily in poverty.  The one is like the lion and the bull, the other like the stag and the hare. For whom does not the rich man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? Are there not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, potentates, enviers, informers? And why speak I of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> and informers, in a case where a man suspects his very domestics?</p>
<p>13. And why say I, <q>when he is alive?</q> Not even when dead is he freed from the villainy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, nor has death power to set him in safety, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> doers despoil him even when dead, so dangerous a thing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. For not only do they dig into houses, but they even burst open tombs and coffins. What then can be more wretched than this man, since not even death can furnish him with this security, but that wretched body, even when deprived of life, is not freed from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> of life, those that commit such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> hastening to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> even with dust and ashes, and much more grievously than when it was alive? For then, it might be, entering his storehouse, they would remove his chests, but abstain from his person, and would not take so much as to strip the body itself but now the accursed hands of the tombbreakers do not even abstain from these, but move and turn it about, and with much cruelty insult it. For after it has been committed to the ground, having stripped it both of its covering of earth and of that which its grave-clothes constitute, they leave it thus to be cast out.</p>
<p>What foe then so deadly as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, which destroys both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the living, and insults the body of the dead, not suffering it even to lie buried in the ground, which is common even to the condemned and to them that have been taken in the vilest crimes? For of them the legislators having exacted the punishment of death, inquire no further; but of these, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> even after death exacts a most bitter punishment, exposing them naked and unburied, a dreadful and pitiable spectacle: since even those who suffer this after sentence and by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> of their judges, do not suffer so grievously as these. For they indeed remain unburied the first and second day, and so are committed to the ground; but these, when they have been committed to the ground, are then stripped naked and insulted. And if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> depart without taking the coffin too, there is still no thanks to their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, but in this case also to their poverty. For she it is that guards it. Whereas most assuredly, had we intruded <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> with even so much as this, and leaving off to form it of stone, had forged it of gold, we should have lost this also.</p>
<p>So faithless a thing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>; which belongs not so much to them that have it, as to them that endeavor to seize it. So that it is but a superfluous argument which aims to show that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> is irresistible, seeing that not even on the day of their death do its possessors obtain security. And yet who is not reconciled with the departed, whether it be wild beast, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>, or whatever else? The very sight being enough to bend even one who is altogether iron, and quite past feeling. Wherefore, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, when one sees a corpse, though it be an enemy public or private whom he sees, yet he weeps for him in common with his dearest friends; and his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> is extinguished with life, and pity is brought in. And it would be impossible, in time of mourning and carrying out of burial, to distinguish an enemy from him who is not such. So greatly do all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> revere their common nature, and the customs which have been introduced respecting it. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> not even on obtaining this, remits her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> against her possessors; nay, it renders them that have been no way wronged enemies of the dead; if at least to strip the dead body be an act of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> very bitter and hostile. And nature for her part reconciles even his enemies to him then: but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> makes foes of them that have nothing to accuse him of, and cruelly intreats the body in its utter desolation. And yet in that case there are many things which might lead one to pity, the fact of its being a corpse, its inability to move, and tending to earth and corruption, the absence of any one to help: but none of these things soften those accursed wretches, because of the tyranny they are under from their base cupidity. For the passion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, like some ruthless tyrant, is at hand, enjoining those inhuman commands and having made wild beasts of them, so brings them to the tombs. Yea, like wild beasts attacking the dead, they would not even abstain from their flesh, if their limbs were any way useful unto them. Such is our enjoyment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>; to be insulted even after death, and deprived of sepulture which even the most desperate criminals obtain.</p>
<p>14. Are we still then, tell me, to be fond of so grievous an enemy? Nay, I beseech you, nay, my brethren! But let us fly from it without turning to look: and if it come into our hands, let us not keep it within, but bind it fast by the hands of the poor. For these are the bonds which have more power to hold it, and from those treasuries it will never more escape; and so this faithless one abides for the time to come faithful, tractable, tame, the right hand of Mercy producing this effect on it.</p>
<p>As I have said then, if it ever come to us, let us hand it over to her; but if it come not, let us not seek after it, nor fret ourselves, nor count its possessors <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>; for what sort of a notion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happiness</font></u></a> is this? Unless you would also say that those who fight with beasts are to be envied, because those high-priced animals are shut up and reserved by the proposers of such contests for themselves: who however not daring themselves to approach or to touch them, but fearing and trembling because of them, hand over others to them. Something like this, I say, is the case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>, when they have shut up their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> in their treasuries as if it were some savage beast, and day by day receive from it innumerable wounds: in this latter unlike to the beasts: since they, when you lead them out, then, and not till then, hurt such as meet them: but this, when it is shut up and preserved, then destroys its possessors and hoarders.</p>
<p>But let us make this beast tame. And it will be tame, if we do not shut it up, but give it into the hands of all who are in need. So shall we reap from this quarter the greatest blessings, both living in the present life with safety and a good hope, and in the day that is to come standing with boldness: to which may we all attain, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy, etc. etc.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:20"></a>1 Corinthians 14:20</h2>
<p>Brethren, be not children in mind; howbeit in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a> be ye babes, but in mind be men.</p>
<p>As might be expected, after his long argument and demonstration he adopts a more vehement style and abundance of rebuke; and mentions an example suited to the subject. For children too are wont to gape after trifles and to be fluttered, but of things very great they have not so much admiration. Since then these also having the gift of tongues, which was the lowest of all, thought they had the whole; therefore he says, <q>Be not children,</q> i.e., be not without understanding where ye ought to be considerate, but there be ye childlike and simple, where unrighteousness is, where vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>. For he that is a babe in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> ought also to be wise. Since as wisdom with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> would not be wisdom, so also simplicity with folly would not be simplicity, it being requisite both in simplicity to avoid folly, and in wisdom <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. For as neither bitter nor sweet medicines in excess do good, so neither does simplicity by itself, nor wisdom: and this is why Christ enjoining us to mix both said, <q>Be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:16</font></u></a></span></p>

For so even the man may become a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, if he be also a child: but as long as he is not a child in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, neither will he be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>.

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:25"></a>1 Corinthians 14:25</h2>
<p><q>And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, declaring that God is among you indeed.</q></p>
<p>Great in this place is the difficulty which one seems to find arising from what is said. For if tongues are for a sign to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not, how says he, if they that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not should see you speaking with tongues, they will say that <q>you are mad?</q> And if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> be <q>not for the unbelieving, but for them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>,</q> how shall also the unbelievers gain thereby?</p>
<p><q>For if there come in,</q> says he, <q>when you are prophesying, one that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believes</font></u></a> not, he is reproved by all, and judged.</q></p>
<p>And not only this, but also after this another question hence springs up: since the tongue will appear on the contrary greater than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. For if the tongues are for a sign to the unbelieving, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, that which draws in aliens and makes of the household, is greater than that which regulates those of the household. What then is the meaning of that expression? Nothing difficult nor obscure, nor contrary to what went before, but rather very agreeable to it, if we give heed: viz., that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> is suitable to both, but then tongue not so. Wherefore having said of the tongue, <q>it is for a sign,</q> he adds, <q>not to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, but to the unbelievers,</q> and to them <q>for a sign,</q> i.e., for astonishment, not so much for instruction.</p>
<p><q>But in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> too,</q> says some one, <q>he did the very same thing, saying, 'but prophesying serves not for the unbelieving, but for them which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>.' For the believer has no need to see a sign, but requires only teaching and catechizing. How then do you say,</q> says he, <q>that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> is of use to both, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says 'not to the unbelieving, but to them which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>?'</q> If you will accurately examine, you will understand what is said. For he said not, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> is not useful to them unbelieving,</q> but, <q>is not for a sign,</q> as the tongue, i.e., a mere sign without profit: nor is the tongue any way useful to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>; for its only work is to astonish and to confound; the word <q>sign</q> being one of those which may be taken two ways: as when he says, <q>show me a sign,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa085.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 86:17</font></u></a></span> and adds, <q>for good:</q> and again, <q>I have become as a wonder unto many,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa070.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 71:7</font></u></a></span> i.e., a sign.</p>
<p>And to show you that he introduced the term <q>sign</q> here, not as a thing which of course did some good, he added that which resulted from it. And what was this? <q>They will say,</q> says he, <q>that you are mad.</q> This however not from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the sign, but from their folly. But when you hear of unbelievers, do not suppose that the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are in every case intended, but at one time they which are incurably diseased and abide uncorrected, and at another they which may be changed; such as were they who in the times of the Apostles admire the mighty things of God which they hear of; such as in the case of Cornelius. His meaning accordingly is this; that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> avails both among the unbelieving and among them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>: as to the tongue, when heard by the unbelieving and inconsiderate, instead of profiting by it, they rather deride the utterers as madmen. For, in fact, it is to them but for a sign, i.e., in order to astonish them merely; whereas they who had understanding used also to profit by it: with a view to which the sign was given. Even as then there were not only certain who accused them of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, but many also admired them as relating the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wonderful works</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. It appears then that the mockers were those without understanding. Wherefore also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> did not simply say, <q>they will say that you are mad,</q> but added, <q>unlearned and unbelievers.</q></p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> is not for a sign merely, but is also suitable and useful for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and for profit unto both classes. And this, if not directly, yet in the sequel he more clearly explained, saying, <q>he is reproved by all. For, if all prophesy,</q> says he, <q>and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all; he is judged by all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, declaring that God is among you indeed.</q></p>
<p>So that not in this only is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> greater, in its availing with each class , but also in its attracting the more shameless of the unbelievers. For it was not the same wonder, when Peter convicted Sapphira, which was a work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, and when he spoke with tongues: but in the former case all shrank into themselves; whereas, when he spoke with tongues, he got the credit of being even beside himself.</p>
<p>3. Having said then, that a tongue profited not, and having again qualified this statement by turning the charge upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, he proceeds to signify that it even does injury. <q>And wherefore was it given?</q> That it might go forth with interpretation: since without this, it has even the contrary effect among them that are without understanding. <q>For if,</q> says he, <q>all speak with tongues, and there come in unbelievers or unlearned, they will say that you are mad;</q> as indeed even the Apostles incurred the suspicion of being drunken: for <q>these men,</q> it says, are filled with new wine: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:13</font></u></a></span> but it is not the fault of the sign, but of their unskilfulness; therefore he added, <q>unlearned and unbelievers,</q> to show that the notion belongs to their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> and want of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; for, as I before said, his object is to rank that gift not among things that are disparaged, but among those which do not greatly profit, and this, in order to repress them, and bring them to a necessity of seeking for an interpreter. For since the greater part looked not to this, but made use of it for display and rivalry, this is what he especially withdraws them from, intimating that their credit is injured, they bringing on themselves a suspicion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>. And this especially is what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> continually attempts to establish, when he wants to lead men away from any thing: he shows that the person suffers loss in respect of those very things which he desires.</p>
<p>And do thou accordingly likewise: if you would lead men away from pleasure, show that the thing is bitter: if you would withdraw them from vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, show that the thing is full of dishonor: thus also was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> used to do. When he would tear away the rich from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a>, he said not merely that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> is a hurtful thing, but also that it casts into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>. <q>For they that desire to be rich,</q> says he, fall into a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:9</font></u></a></span> Thus, since it seems to deliver from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, he attributes to it the contrary of that which the rich supposed. Others again held fast by the wisdom that is without, as though by it establishing Christ's doctrine; he signifies that not only it gives no aid to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cross</font></u></a>, but even makes it void. They held to going to law before strangers, thinking it unmeet to be judged by their own, as if those without were wiser: he points out that going to law before them that are without is shameful. They clave to things offered in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, as displaying perfect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>: he intimates that this is a mark of imperfect <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to manage in the things which concern our neighbors. So also here, because they were wild about this gift of tongues, through their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, he signifies that this on the other hand more than any thing brings shame upon them, not only depriving them of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, but also involving them in a suspicion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>. But he did not at once say this, but having spoken very many things before, when he had made his discourse acceptable, then he brings in that topic so very contrary to their opinion. And this in fact is no more than the common rule; that he who intends thoroughly to shake a deep-rooted opinion and to turn men round to its contrary, must not at once state the opposites: otherwise he will be ridiculous in the eyes of them that are preoccupied by the contrary conviction. Since that which is very much beside expectation cannot be from the beginning easily received, but you must first well undermine by other arguments, and then give it the contrary turn.</p>
<p>Thus for example he did when discoursing of marriage: I mean, since many regarded it as a thing which brings ease, and he wished to intimate that the abstaining from marriage was ease; if he had said this at once he would not so easily have made it acceptable: whereas now, having stated it after much other matter and timing its introduction exactly, he strongly touched the hearers. This also he did in respect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virginity</font></u></a>. For before this having said much, and after this again, at last he says, <q>I spare you,</q> and, <q>I would have you to be free from cares.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co007.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 7:28-32</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>This then he does in respect of the tongues, showing that they not only deprive of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, but also bring shame upon those who have them in the eyes of the unbelievers. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, on the contrary, is both free from reproach among the unbelievers, and has very great credit and usefulness. For none will say in regard to prophesying, <q>they are mad;</q> nor will any one deride them that prophesy; but, on the contrary, will be astonished at and admire them. For <q>he is reproved by all,</q> i.e., the things which he has in his heart, are brought forward and shown unto all:  now it is not the same thing for any one to come in and see one speaking in Persian and another in Syriac, and to come in and hear the secrets of his own mind; as whether he comes in as a tempter and with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, or sincerely; or that such and such a thing has been done by him, and such another designed. For this is much more awful and more profitable than the other. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> therefore, whereas of the tongues he says, <q>you are mad;</q> not however affirming this of himself, but of their judgment: i.e., <q>they will say,</q> says he, <q>that you are mad;</q> here, on the contrary, he makes use both of the verdict of the facts , and that of those who are the objects of the benefit. <q>For he is reproved by all,</q> says he, he is judged by all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, declaring that God is around you indeed. Do you see that this is not capable of two interpretations: how in the former case what is done may be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> of, and here and there an unbeliever might ascribe it to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>? Whereas here there will be no such thing, but he will both wonder and worship, first making a confession by his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, and then by his words also. Thus also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a> worshipped <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, saying, <q>Of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, He is the God that reveals secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan002.htm#verse47" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 2:47</font></u></a></span> Do you see the might of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, how it changed that savage one and brought him under instruction and introduced him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>?</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:26"></a>1 Corinthians 14:26</h2>
<p>4. <q>What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</q></p>
<p>Do you see the foundation and the rule of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christianity</font></u></a>? How, as it is the artificer's work to build, so it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian's</font></u></a> to profit his neighbors in all things.</p>
<p>But since he had vehemently run down the gift; lest it might seem to be superfluous, for with a view to pull down their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> and no more, he did this:— again he reckons it with the other gifts, saying, <q>has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue.</q> For of old they used also to make psalms by a gift and to teach by a gift. Nevertheless, <q>let all these look to one thing,</q> says he, the correction of their neighbor: let nothing be done at random. For if you come not to edify your brother, why do you come here at all? In fact, I do not make much account of the difference of the gifts. One thing concerns me, one thing is my desire, to do all things <q>unto edifying.</q> Thus also he that has the lesser gift will outrun him that has the greater, if this be not wanting. Yea, therefore are the gifts bestowed, that each might be edified; since unless this take place, the gift will rather turn to the condemnation of the receiver. For what, tell me, is the use of prophesying? What is the use of raising the dead, when there is none who profits by it? But if this be the end of the gifts, and if it be possible to effect it in another way without gifts, boast not yourself on the score of the signs, nor do thou bewail yourself to whom the gifts are denied.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:27"></a>1 Corinthians 14:27</h2>
<p>5. <q>And if any man speaks in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn; and let one interpret.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:28"></a>1 Corinthians 14:28</h2>
<p><q>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; and let him speak to himself, and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What do you say, tell me? Having spoken so much of tongues, that the gift is a thing unprofitable, a thing superfluous, if it have no interpreter, do you command again to speak with tongues? I do not command, says he, neither do I forbid; as when he says, <q>if any of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not bid you to a feast and you be disposed to go,</q> he says it not laying down a law for them to go, but not hindering them: so likewise here. <q>And let him speak to himself and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> If he endure not to be silent, says he, but is so ambitious and vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, <q>let him speak by himself. </q>And thus, by the very fact of so permitting, he greatly checked and put them to shame. Which he does also elsewhere, discoursing of converse with a wife and saying, <q>But this I say because of your incontinency.</q> But not so did he speak, when he was discoursing of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. How then? In a tone of command and legislation: <q>Let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> speak, two or three.</q> And he no where here seeks the interpreter, nor does he stop the mouth of him that prophesies as under the former head, saying, <q>If there be no interpreter, let him keep silence;</q> because in fact he who speaks in a tongue is not sufficient of himself. Wherefore if any has both gifts, let him speak. But if he has not, yet wish to speak, let him do so with the interpreter's aid. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> is an interpreter, but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; whereas you are of man. <q>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence:</q> for nothing ought to be done superfluously, nothing for ambition. Only <q>let him speak to himself and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>;</q> i.e., mentally, or quietly and without noise: at least, if he will speak. For this is surely not the tone of one making a law, but it may be of one who shames them more even by his permission; as when he says, <q>but if any hunger, let him eat at home:</q> and seeming to give permission, he touches them hereby the more sharply. <q>For you come not together for this purpose,</q> says he, <q>that you may show that you have a gift, but that you may edify the hearers;</q> which also he before said, <q>Let all things be done unto edifying.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>Let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> speak by two or three, and let the others discern.</q></p>
<p>No where has he added, <q>at the most,</q> as in the case of the tongues. And how is this, one says? For he makes out that neither is prophesy sufficient in itself, if at least he permits the judgment to others. Nay, surely it is quite sufficient; and this is why he did not stop the mouth of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, as of the other, when there is no interpreter; nor, as in his case he said, <q>if there be no interpreter let him keep silence,</q> so also in the case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, <q>if there be none to discern, let him not prophesy;</q> but he only secured the hearer; since for the satisfaction of the hearers he said this, that no diviner might throw himself in among them. For of this also at the beginning he bade them beware, when he introduced a distinction between <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05048b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">divination</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, and now he bids them discriminate and spy out the matter, so that no Satanic teacher might privily enter.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:30"></a>1 Corinthians 14:30</h2>
<p><q>But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:31"></a>1 Corinthians 14:31</h2>
<p><q>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</q></p>
<p>What may this be which is spoken? <q>If when you prophesy,</q> says he, <q>and art speaking, the spirit of another stir him up, be silent thenceforth.</q> For that which he said in the case of the tongues, this also here he requires, that it should be done <q>in turn,</q> only in a diviner way here. For he made not use of the very expression, <q>in turn ?</q> but <q>if a revelation be made to another.</q> Since what need was there further, that when the second was moved to prophesy the first should speak? Ought they then both? Nay, this were profane and would produce confusion. Ought the first? This too were out of place. For to this end when the one was speaking, the Spirit moved the other, in order that he too might say somewhat.</p>
<p>So then, comforting him that had been silenced, he says, <q>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</q> Do you see how again he states the reason wherefore he does all things? For if him that speaks with tongues he altogether forbid to speak, when he has not an interpreter, because of the unprofitableness; reasonably also he bids restrain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, if it have not this quality, but creates confusion and disturbance and unseasonable tumult.</p>

<p><q>And the spirits of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> are subject to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how he put him to shame earnestly and fearfully? For that the man might not strive nor be factious, he signifies that the gift itself was under subjection. For by <q>spirit</q> here, he means its actual working. But if the spirit be subject, much more thou its possessor canst not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> be contentious.</p>
<p>7. Then he signifies that this is pleasing also to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, subjoining and saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:33"></a>1 Corinthians 14:33</h2>

<p>Do you see by how many reasons he leads him to silence and soothes him, in the act of giving way to the other? By one thing and that the chief, that he was not shut up by such a proceeding; <q>for you all can prophesy,</q> says he, <q>one by one.</q> By a second, that this seems good to the Spirit Himself; <q>for the spirits of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> are subject to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>.</q> Besides these, that this is according to the mind of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; <q>for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>is not a God of confusion, but of peace:</q> and by a fourth, that in every part of the world this custom prevails, and no strange thing is enjoined upon them. For thus, says he, <q>I teach in all the Churches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What now can be more awful than these things? For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> was a heaven then, the Spirit governing all things, and moving each one of the rulers and making him inspired. But now we retain only the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbols</font></u></a> of those gifts. For now also we speak two or three, and in turn, and when one is silent, another begins. But these are only signs and memorials of those things. Wherefore when we begin to speak, the people respond, <q>with your Spirit ,</q> indicating that of old they thus used to speak, not of their own wisdom, but moved by the Spirit. But not so now: (I speak of my own case so far.) But the present Church is like a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> who has fallen from her former prosperous days, and in many respects retains the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbols</font></u></a> only of that ancient prosperity; displaying indeed the repositories and caskets of her golden ornaments, but bereft of her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>: such an one does the present Church resemble. And I say not this in respect of gifts: for it were nothing marvelous if it were this only: but in respect also of life and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Thus the list of her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, then gave great ornament to the churches: but now she is made desolate and void, and the tokens only remain. There are indeed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a> now, there are also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>; but they retain not that adornment which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> should have who prepare themselves for such wrestlings. For the special distinction of the virgin is the caring for the things of God alone, and the waiting on Him without distraction: and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow's</font></u></a> mark too should be not so much the not engaging in a second marriage, as the other things, charity to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, hospitality, continuing instant in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, all those other things, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> writing to Timothy requires with great exactness. One may see also the married <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> exhibiting among us great seemliness. But this is not the only thing required, but rather that sedulous attention to the needy, through which those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> of old shone out most brightly. Not as the generality now-a-days. For then instead of gold they were clothed with the fair array of almsgiving: but now, having left off this, they are decked out on every side with cords of gold woven of the chain of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Shall I speak of another repository too emptied of its hereditary splendor? They all met together in old time and sang psalms in common. This we do also now: but then among all was there one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and one heart: but now not in one single <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> can one see that unanimity, rather great is the warfare every where.</p>
<p><q>Peace,</q> even now, <q>to all,</q> he that presides in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a> for, entering as it were into his Father's house: but of this peace the name is frequent, but the reality no where.</p>
<p>8. Then the very houses were churches: but now the church itself is a house, or rather worse than any house. For in a house one may see much good order: since both the mistress of the house is seated on her chair with all seemliness, and the maidens weave in silence, and each of the domestics has his appointed task in hand. But here great is the tumult, great the confusion, and our assemblies differ in nothing from a vintner's shop, so loud is the laughter, so great the disturbance; as in baths, as in markets, the cry and tumult is universal. And these things are here only: since elsewhere it is not permitted even to address one's neighbor in the church, not even if one have received back a long absent friend, but these things are done without, and very properly. For the church is no barber's or perfumer's shop, nor any other merchant's warehouse in the market-place, but a place of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, a place of archangels, a palace of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, heaven itself. As therefore if one had parted the heaven and had brought you in there, though you should see your father or your brother, you would not venture to speak; so neither here ought one to utter any other sound but these which are spiritual. For, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, the things in this place are also a heaven.</p>
<p>And if you believe not, look to this table, call to mind for Whose sake it is set, and why: consider Who it is that is coming forth here; tremble with awe even before the time. For so, when one sees the throne only of a king, in heart he rises up, expecting the king's coming forth. And do thou accordingly thrill with awe even before that thrilling moment: raise up yourself, and before you see the veils drawn aside and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03693b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">choir</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> marching forth, ascend thou to the very heaven.</p>
<p>But the uninitiated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not these things. Well then, it is necessary with a view to him also to introduce other topics. For neither towards him shall we want reasons able to stir him up thoroughly and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> him to soar.</p>
<p>Thou then who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not these things, when you shall hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> saying, <q>Thus says the Lord,</q> quit the earth, ascend thou also unto heaven, consider who it is that by him discourses with you.</p>
<p>But as things are, for a buffoon who is moving laughter or for a whorish and abandoned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, so vast an assemblage of spectators is set, listening in entire quietness to what is spoken, and this when none commands silence ; and there is neither tumult, nor cry, nor any the least noise: but when God is speaking from heaven on subjects so awful, we behave ourselves more impudently than dogs, and even to the harlot <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> we pay greater respect than to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Does it make your flesh creep to be told of these things? Nay then, much rather let it creep when you do them.</p>
<p>9. That which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said of them that despised the poor and feasted alone, <q>What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church of God</font></u></a>, and shame them that have not?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:22</font></u></a></span>— the same allow me also to say of those who make a disturbance and hold conversations in this place. <q>What? Have ye not houses to trifle in? Or despise ye the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church of God</font></u></a>, and corrupt those even who would be modest and quiet?</q> <q>But it is sweet and pleasant for you to converse with your friends.</q> I do not forbid this, but let it be done in the house, in the market, in the baths. For the church is not a place of conversation, but of teaching. But now it differs not from the market; nay, if it be not too bold a word, haply, not even from the stage; in such sort do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> who assemble here adorn themselves more wantonly than the unchaste who are to be found there. Accordingly we see that even hither many profligates are enticed by them; and if any one is trying or intending to corrupt a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, there is no place, I suppose, that seems to him more suitable than the church. And if anything be to be sold or bought, the church appears more convenient than the market. For on such subjects also there is more talk here than in the shops themselves. Or if any wish to say or to hear any scandal, you will find that this too is to be had here more than in the forum without. And if you wish to hear any thing of political matters, or the affairs of private <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">families</font></u></a>, or the camp, go not to the judgment-hall, nor sit in the apothecary's shop; for here, here I say are those who report all these things more accurately; and our assemblies are any thing rather than a church.</p>
<p>Can it be that I have touched you to the quick? I for my part think not. For while you continue in the same practices, how am I to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that you are touched by what has been said? Therefore I must needs handle the same topics again.</p>
<p>Are these things then to be endured? Are these things to be borne? We weary and distract ourselves every day that you may not depart without having learned something useful: and none of you go away at all the better, but rather injured the more. Yea, and <q>ye come together unto judgment,</q> having no longer any cloak for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and you thrust out the more modest, disturbing them with your fooleries on every side.</p>
<p>But what do the multitude say? <q>I do not hear what is read,</q> says one, <q>nor do I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what the words are which are spoken.</q> Because you make a tumult and confusion, because you come not with a reverent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. What do you say? <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what things are said.</q> Well then, for this very reason ought thou to give heed. But if not even the obscurity stir up your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, much more if things were clear would you hurry them by. Yea, this is the reason why neither all things are clear, lest you should indulge indolence; nor obscure, lest you should be in despair.</p>
<p>And whereas that eunuch and barbarian <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act008.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 8:20</font></u></a></span> said none of these things, but surrounded as he was with a crowd of so important affairs and on his journey, had a book in his hands and was reading: do you, both abounding in teachers, and having others to read to you privately , allege to me your excuses and pretexts? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what is said? Why then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> that you may learn: but sure it is impossible to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of all things. For many things are of themselves evident and clear. And further, even if you be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of all, even so ought thou to be quiet, not to put out them that are attentive; that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, accepting your quietness and your reverence, may make the obscure things also plain. But can you not be silent?  Well then, go out, not to become a mischief to others also.</p>
<p>For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> there ought to be but one voice in the church always, even as there is but one body. Therefore both he that reads utters his voice alone, and the Bishop himself is content to sit in silence; and he who chants chants alone; and though all utter the response, the voice is wafted as from one mouth. And he that pronounces a homily pronounces it alone. But when there are many conversing on many and diverse subjects, why do we disturb you for no good? Since surely unless ye thought that we are but disturbing you for no good, you would not in the midst of our speech on such high matters, discourse on things of no consequence.</p>
<p>10. Therefore not in your conduct only, but in your very estimation of things, there is great perversion. And ye gape after superfluities, and leaving the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> pursue all sorts of shadows and dreams. Are not all present things a shadow and dreams, and worse than a shadow? For both before they appear, they fly away; and before they are flown, the trouble they give is much, and more than the pleasure. Let one acquire in this world and bury in the earth ever such abundance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, yet when the night is past, naked he shall depart hence, and no wonder. Since they too who are rich but in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05154a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">dream</font></u></a>, on rising from their couch have nothing of what they seemed to have while sleeping. So also are the greedy of gain: or rather not so, but in a much worse condition. For he that dreams of being rich, neither has the money which he fancied he had, nor is any other mischief found to have accrued to him from this phantasy when he arises, but this man is both deprived of his riches, and has also to depart, filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> which arise out of them; and in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> having but enjoyed a phantasy, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> resulting from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> he sees not in fancy any more, but in the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> of things; and his pleasure was in dreams, but the punishment ensuing on his pleasure turns out no more a dream, but is matter of actual experience. Yea rather, even before that punishment, even here he pays the heaviest penalty, in the very collecting of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> wearing into himself innumerable sadnesses, anxieties, accusations, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumnies</font></u></a>, tumults, perturbations.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:34"></a>1 Corinthians 14:34</h2>
<p>Let your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also says the law.</p>
<p>Having abated the disturbance both from the tongues and from the prophesyings; and having made a law to prevent confusion, that they who speak with tongues should do this in turn, and that they who prophesy should be silent when another begins; he next in course proceeds to the disorder which arose from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, cutting off their unseasonable boldness of speech: and that very opportunely. For if to them that have the gifts it is not permitted to speak inconsiderately, nor when they will, and this, though they be moved by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>; much less to those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> who prate idly and to no purpose. Therefore he represses their babbling with much authority, and taking the law along with him, thus he sews up their mouths; not simply exhorting here or giving counsel, but even laying his commands on them vehemently, by the recitation of an ancient law on that subject. For having said, <q>Let your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> keep silence in the churches;</q> and <q>it is not permitted unto them to speak, but let them be in subjection;</q> he added, <q>as also says the law.</q> And where does the law say this? <q>Your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen003.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 3:16</font></u></a></span> Do you see the wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, what kind of testimony he adduced, one that not only enjoins on them silence, but silence too with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; and with as great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> as that wherewith a maid servant ought to keep herself quiet. Wherefore also having himself said, <q>it is not permitted unto them to speak,</q> he added not, <q>but to be silent,</q> but instead of <q>to be silent,</q> he set down what is more, to wit, <q>the being in subjection.</q> And if this be so in respect of husbands, much more in respect of teachers, and fathers, and the general assembly of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. <q>But if they are not even to speak,</q> says one, <q>nor ask a question, to what end are they to be present?</q> That they may hear what they ought; but the points which are questioned let them learn at home from their husbands. Wherefore also he added,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:35"></a>1 Corinthians 14:35</h2>
<p><q>And if they would learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home.</q></p>
<p>Thus, <q>not only, as it seems, are they not allowed to speak,</q> says he, <q>at random, but not even to ask any question in the church.</q> Now if they ought not to ask questions, much more is their speaking at pleasure contrary to law. And what may be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his setting them under so great subjection? Because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> is in some sort a weaker being and easily carried away and light minded. Here you see why he set over them their husbands as teachers, for the benefit of both. For so he both rendered the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> orderly, and the husbands he made anxious, as having to deliver to their wives very exactly what they heard.</p>
<p>Further, because they supposed this to be an ornament to them, I mean their speaking in public; again he brings round the discourse to the opposite point, saying, <q>For it is shameful for a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> to speak in the church.</q> That is, first he made this out from the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, then from common reason and our received custom; even when he was discoursing with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> about long hair, he said, <q>Does not even nature herself teach you?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:14</font></u></a></span> And everywhere you may find this to be his manner, not only from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">divine Scriptures</font></u></a>, but also from the common custom, to put them to shame.</p>
<p>2. But besides these things, he also shames them by consideration of what all agreed on, and what was every where prescribed; which topic also here he has set down, saying,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:36"></a>1 Corinthians 14:36</h2>
<p><q>What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you alone?</q></p>
<p>Thus he brings in the other Churches also as holding this law, both abating the disturbance by consideration of the novelty of the thing, and by the general voice making his saying acceptable. Wherefore also elsewhere he said, <q>Who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, even as I teach everywhere in all the Churches.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:17</font></u></a></span> And again, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is not a God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the Churches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co014.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 14:33</font></u></a></span> And here, <q>What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you alone?</q> i.e., <q>neither first, nor alone are you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>, but the whole world. </q>Which also writing to the Colossians he said, <q>even as it is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 1:6</font></u></a></span> speaking of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But he turns it also at another time to the encouragement of his hearers; as when he says that theirs were the first fruits, and were manifest unto all. Thus, writing to the Thessalonians he said, <q>For from you has sounded forth the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> and, <q>in every place your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> to God-ward is gone forth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th001.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 1:8</font></u></a></span> And again to the Romans, <q>Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is proclaimed throughout the whole world.</q> For both are apt to shame and stir up, as well the being commended of others, as that they have others partakers in their judgment. Wherefore also here he says; <q>What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you only?</q> <q>For neither can you say this,</q> says he; <q>we were made teachers to the rest, and it cannot be right for us to learn of others;</q> nor, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> remained in this place only, and no precedents from other quarters ought to be received.</q> Do you see by how many arguments he put them to shame? He introduced the law, he signified the shamefulness of the thing, he brought forward the other Churches. </p>
<p>3. Next, what is strongest of all he puts last, saying, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> ordains these things even at this time by me.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:37"></a>1 Corinthians 14:37</h2>
<p>Thus: <q>if any man thinks himself to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, or spiritual, let him take <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of the things which I write unto you that they are the commandments of the Lord.</q></p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:38"></a>1 Corinthians 14:38</h2>
<p><q>But if any man is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, let him be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>And wherefore did he add this? Intimating that he is not using <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> nor contention, which is a sign of them who wish not to set up their own things, but aim at what is profitable to others. Wherefore also in another place he says, <q>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:16</font></u></a></span> But he does not this everywhere, but only where the offenses are not very great, and then rather as putting them to shame. Since when he discourses of other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, he speaks not thus. But how? <q>Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor effeminate, shall inherit the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Behold, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> say unto you, that if you receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, Christ will profit you nothing.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal005.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 5:2</font></u></a></span> But here, since his discourse was of silence, he does not very keenly inveigh against them, by this very thing attracting them the more. Then, as he is ever wont to do, unto the former subject whence he digressed to say these things, he brings back his discourse as follows:</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:39"></a>1 Corinthians 14:39</h2>
<p><q>Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</q></p>
<p>For this too is his wont, not only to work out what is before him, but also starting from that to set right whatever seems to him in any way akin to it, and again to return to the former, so as not to appear to wander from the subject. For so when he was discoursing of their concord in their banquets, he digressed to their Communion in the Mysteries, and having thence put them to shame, he returns again to the former, saying, <q>Wherefore, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:33</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>And here, accordingly, having discoursed of good order in their gifts, and of its being a duty neither to faint in the lesser, nor to be puffed up on account of the greater; then having made an excursion from thence to the sobriety becoming <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> and having established it, he returns again to his subject, saying, <q>Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</q> Do you see how to the end he preserved the difference of these? And how he signifies that the one is very necessary, the other not so? Wherefore of the one he says, <q>desire earnestly ,</q> but of the other, <q>forbid not.</q></p>
<p>4. Then, as in brief summary, setting all things right, he adds the words,</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-1-Corinthians-14:40"></a>1 Corinthians 14:40</h2>
<p><q>Let all things be done decently and in order.</q></p>
<p>Again giving a blow to them who chose to behave themselves unseemly without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, and to incur the imputation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>; and who keep not their proper rank. For nothing does so build up as good order, as peace, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; even as their contraries tend to pull down. And not only in things spiritual, but also in all others one may observe this. Thus whether it be in a dance, or a ship, or in a chariot, or a camp, if you should confound the order, and casting the greater out of their proper place, should bring in the lesser into their rank, you destroy all, and thus things are turned upside down. Neither let us then destroy our order, nor place the head below and the feet above:  now this is done when we cast down right reason, and set our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lusts</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and pleasure, over the rational part: whence violent are the billows, and great the confusion, and intolerable the tempest, all things being wrapt in darkness.</p>
<p>And, if you will, let us first examine the unseemliness which arises herefrom, and then the loss. How then may this be clear to us, and thoroughly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>? Let us bring forward a man in that frame of mind; enamoured of a harlot and overcome by a dishonorable passion; and then we shall see the mockery which this comes to. For what can be baser than a man watching the doors before the harlots' chambers, and beaten by a whorish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, and weeping, and lamenting, and turning his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> into shame? And if you will also see the loss, call to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, the expenditure of money, the extreme risks, the contests with rival lovers, the wounds, the stripes received in such affrays.</p>
<p>Such also are they who are holden by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>; or rather they behave themselves more unseemly. For whereas these are wholly occupied about one person; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> busy themselves about all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men's</font></u></a> substance alike, both poor and rich, and long for things that are not; a thing which above all denotes the wildness of their passion. For they say not, <q>I would fain have the substance of such a person or of such another,</q> only, but they want the very mountains to be gold, and the houses and all that they see; and they go forth into another world, and this passion they feel to a boundless degree, and at no point cease from their lusting. What discourse can set before us the tempest of those thoughts, the waves, the darkness? And where the waves and tempest are so great, what pleasure can there be? There is not any; but tumult, and anguish, and black clouds which instead of rain bring great sorrow of heart: the kind of thing which is wont to happen in the case of those who are enamoured of beauty not their own. Wherefore they who have no passionate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> at all are in more pleasure than any lovers.</p>
<p>5. This however no man would gainsay. But to me even he who loves, but restrains his passion, seems to live more pleasurably than he who continually enjoys his mistress. For though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> be rather difficult, nevertheless even at that disadvantage the argument must be ventured on: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of the increased difficulty not being the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the thing, but because of the want of meet hearers for this high morality. Thus: whether is it pleasanter, tell me, to the lover, to be despised by his beloved, or to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, and to look down upon her? Evidently the latter. Whom then, tell me, will the harlot value more? Him that is a slave to her and is already led captive at her will, or him that is above her nets and soars higher than her arrows?  Every one must see, the latter. And about whom will she take more thought, the fallen, or him that is not yet so? Him that is not yet so, of course. And which will be more an object of desire, he who is subdued, or he who is not yet taken? He who up to this time is not yet taken. And if you disbelieve it, I will produce my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> from what takes place within yourselves. As thus: of which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> would a man be more enamored; one that easily submits and gives herself up to him, or one that denies, and gives him trouble? Evidently of this last; since hereby the longing is more vehemently kindled. Of course then in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman's</font></u></a> case also exactly the same thing will happen. And him will they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and admire more who looks down upon them. But if this be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, so likewise is the other, that he enjoys greater pleasure who is more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> and beloved. Since the general too lets alone the city that has been once taken, but that which stands out and maintains the struggle he besets with all diligence: and the hunter, when the animal is caught, keeps it shut up in darkness as the harlot does her lover, but pursues that which flies from him.</p>
<p>But I shall be told, <q>the one enjoys his desire, the other not so.</q> But freedom from disgrace, and from being a slave under her tyrannical commands, the not being led and dragged about by her as a drudge, beaten, spit upon, pitched head foremost; do you consider this to be a small pleasure, tell me? Nay, if one would accurately examine these things, and were able to gather into one their insults, complaints, everlasting quarrels, some arising from their tempers, others from their wantonness, their enmities, and all the rest, such as they only that feel them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>—he will find that there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> but has more truces than this wretched life of theirs. What pleasure then do you mean, tell me? The temporary and brief enjoyment of intercourse? But this speedily does strife overtake, and storms, and rage, and the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> again.</p>
<p>6. And these things have been said by us, as one would speak discoursing with licentious youths, who do not very patiently submit to hear our discourses of the kingdom and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>And now that we are bringing forward these topics also, it is not even possible to say how great is the pleasure of the continent; if one frame in one's own mind his crowns, his rewards, his converse with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, the proclaiming of him before the world, his boldness, those blessed and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07687a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">immortal</font></u></a> hopes of his.</p>
<p><q>But intercourse has a certain pleasure:</q> for this they are continually repeating: <q>while the continent continually suffers pain contending with the tyranny of nature.</q> Nay, but one shall find just the contrary result. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> and tumult is present with the unchaste rather: there being in his body a violent tempest, and no sea in a storm so grievously vexed as he; never withstanding his passion, but ever receiving blows from it; as the possessed and they that are continually rent in the midst by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil spirits</font></u></a>. Whereas the temperate like a noble champion continually giving blows to it, reaps the best of pleasures, and sweeter than ten thousand of that kind; and this victory and his good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, and those illustrous trophies, are ornaments for him continually to deck himself withal.</p>
<p>As to the other, if after his intercourse he has a little respite, it must be counted nothing. For again the storm comes on, and again there are waves. But he that commands himself does not suffer this tumult to lay hold of him at all, nor the sea to arise, nor the wild beast to roar. And even if he endure some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> in restraining such an impulse, yet so does the other also, continually receiving blows and stabs, and unable to endure the sting: and it is like as if there were a wild horse <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">furious</font></u></a> and struggling, and one should check with the bridle, and hold him in with all skill: while another giving him the rein to escape the trouble, were dragged along by him and carried hither and there.</p>
<p>If I have spoken these things more plainly than is becoming, let no man blame me. For I desire not to make a brave show by a gravity of words, but to make my hearers grave.</p>
<p>Therefore also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> spare no such words, wishing to extirpate the licentiousness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, but do even more nakedly inveigh against them than we do now in the things we have spoken. For so a physician wishing to remove an ulcer does not consider how he may keep his hands clean, but how he may rid the patient of the ulcer; and he who would raise on high the lowly, first makes himself lowly; and he who seeks to slay the conspirator stains himself with blood as well as the other, and this makes him the more brilliant. Since if one were to see a soldier returning from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, stained with gore and blood and brains, he will not loathe him nor turn from him on this account, but will even admire him the more. So then let us do, when we see any one returning, covered with blood after the slaughter of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> desire, let us the more admire him and become partakers of his battle and victory, and say to those who indulge this wild <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, <q>show us the pleasure you derive from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>; for the continent has that which comes of his victory, but thou none from any quarter. But if you should mention that which is connected with the criminal act, yet the other is more manifest and satisfactory. For you have from the enjoyment something brief and hardly apparent; but he from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, has both a greater and an enduring and a sweeter <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>. The company of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> has surely no such power as self-command, to preserve the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> undisturbed and give it wings.</q></p>
<p>Well then: the continent man, as I said, thus evidently makes his pleasure out to us: but in your case I see the dejection arising from defeat, but the pleasure, desiring to see, I find not. For what do you consider the moment of pleasure? That before the criminal action? Nay, it is not so, for it is a time of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and delirium and frenzy: to grind the teeth and be beside one's self is not any pleasure: and if it were pleasure, it would not produce the same effects on you which they who are in pain endure. For they who strike with their fists and are stricken grind their teeth, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> in travail distracted with pains do the same. So that this is no pleasure, but frenzy rather, and confusion, and tumult. Shall we say then, the time after the action? Nay, neither is this. For neither could we say that a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> just delivered is in pleasure, but in release from certain pains. But this is by no means pleasure, but weakness rather and falling away: and there is a great difference between these two. What then is the time of pleasure, tell me? There is none. But if there be any, it is so brief as not even to be apparent. At least, having <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealously</font></u></a> sought in a great many ways to detect and apprehend it, we have not been able. But the time of the chaste man's pleasure is not such, rather it is wider and evident to all. Or rather, all his life is in pleasure, his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> crowned, the waves laid, no disturbance from any quarter arising within him.</p>
<p>Since then this man's life is more in pleasure, while the life spent in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of pleasure is in dejection and disquiets; let us flee from licentiousness, let us keep hold on continence, that we may also obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy, etc., etc.</p></div>

the Hebrews count among the Writings, contains in the form of mysteries many of
the hidden truths of Christ and of the Church—that is, Esther herself, in a
prefiguration of the Church, frees the people from danger; and after
Haman—whose name is interpreted as wickedness—is killed, she assigns future
generations a part in the feast and the festival day. In fact, the translator
of the biblical narrative claims that he has copied this book from the
documents of the Hebrews, and rendered it straightforwardly and word for word;
and yet he did not omit entirely what he found in the Vulgate edition, rather
after translating with complete fidelity the Hebrew original he added as an
appendix to the end of the book the rest of the passages he found outside it.
We have, moreover, explained in an allegorical fashion the material that has
been drawn from the Hebrew source; while we have chosen to not to comment upon
all the other passages that have been added to it in accordance with the
language and the literature of the Greeks, and marked by an obel. But any
serious reader can understand well enough the sense of these passages once he
has carefully scrutinized the previous ones. And since you, noblest of queens,
perceive so well the divine mysteries contained in the interpreted passages, you
will no doubt arrive at a proper understanding of the others. May almighty God,
who spurred on the spirit of that queen so that she would rid her people of
their troubles, deign to lead you—who labors with the same kind of zeal—toward
eternal joy.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

his famous feast. “In the days of Ahasuerus, who ruled from India to Ethiopia
over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces; when he was sitting on the throne
of his kingdom...” The story of Esther is found not only in the holy books but
also in the Antiquities of Josephus, though their accounts of these events
differ in certain respects. But the latter also raises the question of just who
was this Ahasuerus who ruled from India to Ethiopia, over one hundred and
twenty-seven provinces; for when Josephus mentions him, he reports that Cyrus
was the son of King Xerxes who ruled in Persia after his uncle Darius. He says,
therefore, that Cyrus was the one the Greeks called Artaxerxes—surnamed
“Longhand”—who held the kingdom for forty years; but I don’t believe that
Esther lived in that era because Ezra would never have kept silent about her,
given that he writes that it was at that time that Ezra and Menna returned from
Babylon, and then narrates their subsequent actions. Eusebius, accordingly,
suggests in his Chronicle that this Ahasuerus was called Artaxerxes, and that
he reigned for forty years after his uncle Darius, who was surnamed “Bastard.”</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“The city of Shushan was
the beginning of his kingdom.” Susa is the capital of Persia, which according
to the chroniclers was founded by the brother of Memnon; and it is called Susa
because it borders on the river Susa, which is the location of the royal palace
of Cyrus. This was known for its bright and colorful stone, along with its gold
columns, its ponds, and its gems; and it also contained a likeness of the
heavens inlaid with shining stars, and other things that the human mind finds
difficult to comprehend. And it was there, we are told, that the king in
question would stage for his subject peoples a grand feast that featured
impressive accouterments and a wealth of riches. Hence it continues:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So in the third year of
his rule, he held a grand feast for his officials and young men, the famous
heroes of Persia and Media and the chiefs of the provinces in his presence, so
that he could show off the wealth of the glory of his kingdom, the grandeur and
ostentation of his power for a long time, namely 180 days. And when the days of
the feast came to an end, he invited all the people who were found in Susa,
from the greatest to the least; and he ordered a seven-day feast prepared in
the entryway of the garden and the grove that the king had planted and
cultivated by hand. And from every spot were hanging tents the color of the
sky, and fine linen and blue, held up with ropes of flax and purple which were
inserted into circles of ivory and supported by marble columns. And those who
were invited were drinking from gold goblets, and food was brought to them in
various kinds of vessels. Also excellent wine was served in abundance, as
befitted the royal magnificence. And yet he did not force to drink anyone who
did not wish to do so; but as the king had decreed, he sat each of his
officials at tables so that each one could take whatever he liked.” Though
these preparations for so rich a feast seem intended to portray in concrete
terms the parade of wealth and the abundance of delights possessed by a
powerful king, it is actually a very sanctified allegory which symbolizes the
magnitude of spiritual riches, and the excellence of the necessities of life,
provided by the most powerful of kings, namely the Lord Christ, which he—in
accord with his method of dispensation—has generously distributed to each of
his faithful ones. For this king of great wealth, who was convinced by the
entreaties of his faithful wife to do away with the imminent destruction of the
Jews which wicked men were plotting, prefigures no one more than our Redeemer
who is accosted every day by the prayers of the Church who is his dearest wife,
and frees his chosen ones from the hands of their enemies, and subjects their
adversaries to the punishment they deserve. And that Esther prefigures the
Church, no one can doubt; nor may she be described as the bride of anyone but
Christ. That is why no one should reject this interpretation merely because
this actual king was faithless, as though this would mean he could never be a
figure of the just king; for we do not say that anyone’s treacheries or
transgressions are the sum of his behavior, whether he is trustworthy or even
faithless: “He did not sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth” (1 Peter 2).
“For how can light associate with darkness; or what can Christ have in common
with Belial (2 Corinthians 6)?” Rather, the good actions and just judgments of
any individual should be associated with no less an authority than the one from
whom comes every good, about whom it is written: “He will judge the world in
fairness, and the peoples in his truth” (Psalm 9). For the transgressions and
sins of the faithful do not provide the most accurate representation of their
character, as do the errors and wicked actions of the gentiles; and the reason
we are saying this is because certain of our teachers have used David’s
behavior toward Uriah and his wife as a prefiguration of Christ and the Church.
Why would anyone want to suggest that Moses’ doubts at the “waters of
dissension,” Aaron’s deception about manufacturing the calf, Solomon’s lust,
Ezekiel’s arrogance, Peter’s denial, and Saul’s blasphemy are fitting prefigurations
of our Redeemer? And yet no one can properly deny that the good actions and the
correct doctrines of those men offered a great deal of evidence on his behalf.
No one, therefore, ought to take us to task for comparing, by some sort of
analogy, the righteous works and the just judgments of a great king to the king
and judge of all the ages; since whatever is good belongs to him, and every sin
flees his presence. But if anyone should feel that what we are saying is
inappropriate, let him read the prophet Isaiah who compared Cyrus, the king of
Persia and a gentile, to our Redeemer when he said in the person of the Lord:
“I will give you hidden treasures and the secrets of hidden things so that you
may know that I am the Lord, since I the God of Israel call on your name for
the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen one; and I have summoned you
in your name, I have made you like me though you have not acknowledged me. I am
the Lord and there is none greater; aside from me there is no God. I have
strengthened you, though you have not acknowledged me” (Isaiah 45). Let him
read as well the short works of the Fathers, who said that the deeds—or rather,
the misdeeds—of the shameful kings Saul and Jeconiah were symbolic
prefigurations of the holy actions of our Redeemer—that is, they interpret the
death of Saul, who was anointed king but was quite rightly killed for his
crimes, in reference to the death of Christ the innocent king; and they explain
the fact that Jeconiah was exiled from Judah to Babylonia—which he deserved
because of his sins—as a prefiguration of the grace of that same Redeemer of
ours, which was why he deigned to wander through the world for sake of saving
the nations once he had left the Jews behind for their faithlessness. They also
reported that the actions of Pharaoh or Nebuchadnezzar should be understood as
prefigurations of the enemies of the Church; for example: Pharaoh commands the
male infants of the people of God to be killed in the river and the females
spared, because the Devil wishes to extinguish the sturdy aspects of our
behavior, and to nourish the feckless and weak ones. In the same way,
Nebuchadnezzar ordered all the peoples subject to him to bow down and worship
his statue to the sounds of orchestras and musicians; and the Devil uses the
sweetness of earthly pomp to try and steer the human race away from proper
intent, and to pervert the hearts of the deceived into indulging their desire,
which is “the worship of images.” If, therefore, certain actions—namely the just
punishment of shameful men—prefigured not only wicked acts but good ones, could
not the good actions or words of good men, which are contained in the writings
of the prophets, also have prefigured the good deeds of those who came after
them? After all, the power of the sacred narrative is (as someone has said)
that it tells us about what happened at o time or another so that it may spell
out what is going to come; it approves of the actor so that it may reprove him
in the guise of an allegory, and condemns what has happened to persuade us
allegorically of what is going to happen. Let us also consider the short works
of St. Augustine, who said that the seven husbands of a single wife who died
without children, with whom the Sadducees were testing the Lord because they
denied the idea of resurrection, were likewise a sure prefiguration of the
sacrament of the Church. In fact, he taught that the wife, and her barrenness
and death, as well as the deaths of her husbands, prefigured noteworthy events
even though the Lord himself did not tell this story, and neither did any of
the evangelists who were writing in his person; instead they recorded the
unspeakable words that wicked men had thrown in the Lord’s face, on account of
the Lord’s very sanctified response. So when the faithful reader finds these
sentiments and others like them among the statements of the sacred Fathers, he
should not give the credit to us if we choose to include assertions of a
similar character in our own brief works.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So in the third year of
his rule, King Ahasuerus held a grand feast for all his officials and young
men, the famous heroes of Persia and Media, and the chiefs of the provinces in
his presence, so that he could show off the wealth of the glory of his
kingdom.” For our Redeemer—whom Ahasuerus represented in both his title and his
rank—is interpreted as “my entry” or “my court”, because in the third era of
that age the eternal ruler of man in the Father and the Holy Spirit opened wide
to the human race the sacrament of his incarnation; and he has opened up for us
the entryway to life and served to his faithful ones the most ample of
spiritual banquets. The first era, then, was before the Law, the second was
under the Law, and the third was under grace, namely when he fulfilled his preaching
in the Gospels and prepared for all the nations an opulent meal of his body and
blood. That is to say, the Lord himself was spiritually commending to us, in as
a mystery, the excellence of this feast through the Gospel parable in which he
described the king who threw a wedding for his son, and the great meal prepared
by a man. “So the great king held a feast for seven days, in the entryway of
the garden and the grove that the king had planted and cultivated by hand,”
because for the entire period of that life which transpires in multiples of the
number seven, our Redeemer satisfies his chosen ones with the pasturage of the
divine word and the feasts of the virtues, in the Church of this world where
each of the faithful readies himself— with correct faith and good works—to
enter Paradise and the celestial kingdom. Hence they will become accustomed in
every respect to the delights and the pleasures of the heavenly kingdom where
fruit-bearing trees are planted, that is, where holy men and those who are
famous for their good deeds show—through the divine gift that has been lavished
on them—the beauty of holy conduct and proper doctrine. Hanging there “from
every spot are tents the color of the sky, and fine linen and blue,” because it
is there that the spiritual ornament of study, and the splendor of celestial
wisdom, flash with the brilliance of the virtues whose proper purpose is to
instruct us in those things. For that matter, the color of linen mimics (as
some claim) the appearance of gold, and has deservedly been compared to the
sheen of divine wisdom which excels above all in the cultivation and the
practice of righteousness. “And these tents were stretched with ropes of flax
and purple, and were supported by marble columns.” For flax signifies the mortification
of the flesh, purple the blood of martyrdom, ivory the chastity of the body,
and marble columns the solidity of the sacred teachers. It therefore makes
sense that, as we are told, the tents of various colors were held up with ropes
of flax and purple by ivory circles on marble columns, because the beauty of
the holy Church ought to shine in the contemplation of wisdom—or rather in the
perfection of the virtues—through the restraint and chastity of bodies, i.e.
with the honor of martyrdom among the teachers of the sacred Gospels; and it
ought, through both the word and the example of these men, to reach the notice
of many people so that those who have been taught, encouraged and comforted by
them may be able to reach, as they should, the court of the celestial empire.
There were also “gold and silver couches spread about a floor inlaid with
emerald and Parian marble, which he decorated with a marvelous variety of
pictures,” because the humility of the saints, which is decorated with diverse
kinds of the various virtues, provides the peace of inner contemplation to the
chosen of God when they consider the divine word and investigate the true
wisdom. It is there that the sweetness of knowing and loving God is lavished
generously upon those who seek righteously in the gift of the Holy Spirit. It
is about this couch that the bride speaks in the Song of Songs: “Our couch is
bright with flowers;” in other words, when any of the saints make use of the
tranquility of his times and depart from times of tribulation, it is then above
all that they are free to make use of the sacred couches, fasting, prayer and
all the other fruits of the spirit. They may then raise themselves up high in
the contemplation of ethereal matters to gaze in all directions upon the glory
of the divine majesty, since they have been given a respite from less essential
concerns. The emerald is, after all, so called because it is so green; and
Parian is the whitest kind of marble; and it is fitting that, as we are told,
the floor where the couches were placed was set with these two stones, since it
is through the whiteness, i.e. the chastity of the body, and the greenness of
the good sense which is always verdant in the grace of God, that the
foundations of humility are solidly laid where the reward of eternal peace is
prepared for all those who deserve it. Hence it is written: “Blessed are the
poor in spirit, because theirs is the kingdom of Heaven” (Matthew 5). And “He
who has well humbled himself will be properly raised up” (Matthew 23). That is
why the same Truth says to the disciples elsewhere in the Gospels: “Learn from
me because I am gentle and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your
souls; for my yoke is smooth, and my burden is light” (Matthew 11). “And those
who were invited to the royal feast drank from golden goblets.” Those who drink
from golden goblets are those who draw divine wisdom from the precious sayings
of the sacred Gospels; and those who are served foods in different kinds of
vessels are those who—by reading the Law and the prophets, and the apostles and
the Gospels—are known to accept the manifold meals of spiritual doctrine on
which are fed the souls brought up for eternal life. And as befits the
magnificence of a king, wine is also served to the guests in exceptional
abundance, since the gift of celestial grace is generously granted to each and
every one of the faithful in accordance with the dispensation of divine mercy
and the grant of the Holy Spirit. This is because, in Paul’s judgment: “the
charity of God is spread throughout our hearts by the Holy Spirit which was
given to us (Romans 5)”; and “To each one is given a manifestation of the
Spirit for their use. Indeed, one person is able through the Spirit to speak
the words of wisdom, while another, through the same Spirit, speaks the words
of knowledge; to another is given faith in that same Spirit; to another, the
grace of healing in that one Spirit; to another, the working of miracles; to
another, prophecy; to another, the power to discern spirits; to another, the
varieties of languages; to another, the interpretation of speech” (1
Corinthians 12). And what we said a moment ago—i.e. that he did not force to
drink anyone who did not wish to do so, but as the king had decreed he sat each
of his officials at tables so that each could take whatever he liked—symbolizes
the freedom of grace in which no one is forced against his will to accept a
spiritual gift, rather the willing participation of each individual is sought
in accordance with that statement of the Lord where he says: “Whoever can
accept this, let him accept it” (Matthew 19). And in the same spirit: “If you
wish to enter into life, then keep the commandments” (ibid.). And again: “If
you wish to be perfect, go, sell everything you have and give it to the poor,
and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow me” (ibid.). For at the
festive and sacred feast of the holy Church, our king seats his teachers at the
table of the Holy Scriptures so that they might dispense to each of the
faithful the doctrines that are suited to him, and adapt to each man’s
character the preaching of the word so that each one might take from it
whatever he perceives as feasible and useful to him. Of course, the words of a
teacher must be crafted with such skill that even though the faults of his
hearers differ from one another, they should be suited to each individual and
yet not contradict themselves; in this way he may maneuver in a single pass
between the moderate passions, while at the same time cutting out—in the manner
of a double-edged sword—the tumors of carnal thoughts. He may, accordingly,
preach humility to the arrogant without making the timid more afraid; he may
lavish authority upon the timid without loosening up on the arrogant; he may
preach to the indolent and the sluggish attention to good works, without giving
the impulsive the license to act without restraint; he may place limits upon
the impulsive without making the indolent secure in their laziness; he may
dampen the wrath of the impatient without encouraging carelessness among the
easygoing and the gentle; he may enflame the feckless to take action without
adding fuel to the irritable; he may fill the miserly with the desire to give
generously, without having to preach tightfistedness to the prodigal; he may
praise marriage to the promiscuous, without enticing the continent back to
excess; he may praise bodily virginity to the continent, without causing
married couples to look down on the fruitfulness of the flesh. He will preach
the good in such a way that the bad will not also be commanded alongside it; he
will praise the highest good without despising the final one; he will foster
the final one so that for as long as it is believed sufficient, no one will
ever turn from it toward the highest. So the faithful and wise slave who has
been appointed the manager by his master, and gives his fellow slaves their
share of the wheat on time, is praised by his master’s words; and he is
promised that he will be put in charge of all his goods. Hence it is necessary
that one who ministers with the cup of the word should possess the means of
discretion, so that he may obtain from his ministry praise and reward rather
than condemnation and torment.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

summoned to the king but refused to come, because of which she was stripped of
her royal rank and rejected by her husband.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font size="3"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">“Vashti the queen also
held a feast for the women in the palace where King Ahasuerus liked to stay.”
Queen Vashti must symbolize the Jewish people, which at the time seemed to have
ruled like a queen since it was found to stand apart from all the other nations
in its worship of a single God. So she held a feast for the women where the
king would liked to stay; that is, in Jerusalem itself—the site of the Temple
of God and the Holy of Holies—it demonstrated its observance of the Law in
worship or rather by meditating on the Holy Scriptures, through which it
supplied to its members the refreshment of spiritual knowledge by granting them
the awareness of their power from Heaven.<span> 
</span>“So on the seventh day when the king was very festive, and after he had
drunk too much and grown heated from the wine, he ordered Mehuman, and Biztha,
and Harbona, and Bigtha, and Abigtha, and Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs
who ministered in his presence, to bring in Queen Vashti before the king once
the diadem had been placed upon her head, so that he could show off her beauty
to all the peoples and officials; for she was very beautiful. But she refused,
and disdained to come at the king’s command.” The seventh day of the feast
symbolizes the beauty of the time when the Lord incarnate clarified in his
abundant grace all the mysteries of the Law and the prophets upon which the
pious minds of devout men had been feeding till then. It is about this completion
that Paul writes to the Galatians when he says: “And when the time was
completed, God sent his own son made from a woman so that he might redeem those
who were under the Law, so that we might receive the adoption given to
children. Because you are the children of God, God has sent the spirit of his
Son into your hearts, crying: ‘Abba! Father (Galatians 4)!’” And it is well
said that after drinking too much he had grown heated from the wine, because he
poured into his disciples, through the arrival of the Paraclete, abundant grace
through the gift of the Holy Spirit. We read about this wine in the Acts of the
Apostles that when, in the Cenacle of Zion, the Holy Spirit settled upon one
hundred and twenty believers and the Jews thought that they were full of new
wine, Peter answered them with: “Brothers, despite what you think these men are
sober, since it is the third hour of the day. But this is what was spoken
through the prophet Joel: ‘And it will be in the last days, says the Lord, that
I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters
will prophesy; and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream
dreams. And I will indeed pour out from my spirit in those days upon my
servants and my maids, and they will prophesy; and I will show marvels in the
heavens above, and signs on the earth below (Acts 2).’” When, during the
allegorical wedding in the Gospel, the chief steward tastes the sweetness of
the wine, he says to the groom: “Every man serves the good wine first, and once
they have become drunk he serves the inferior stuff. But you have saved the
good wine till now.” So the king in his happiness ordered the seven eunuchs who
ministered in his presence to bring in Queen Vashti before the king once the
diadem had been placed upon her head, so that he could show off her beauty to
all the peoples. And in the same way, our Redeemer Christ (i.e. the Lord)
directed the order of the aforementioned saints, which was full of the grace of
the sevenfold Holy Spirit, to assemble the Jewish people at a spiritual feast,
so that its beauty and nobility— which it had as a privilege of its ancestors,
and because of its knowledge of the Law and the prophets and its cultivation of
righteousness (for which it was better known than the other nations before the
coming of the Lord)—would be known to the peoples of the entire world. But she
disdained to come, not only showing her contempt for the emissaries but even
rejecting the authority of the supreme king. Of course, the Lord himself
referred to this in the Gospel parables, when he explained that it was the
mercy of the righteous father toward his wasteful but penitent son, whom he
took into his home, that led him to sacrifice a calf and hold a feast which his
older son refused to attend even though his father had summoned him from town.
And elsewhere we read about the men who—occupied with their pursuit of other
things—did not want to come to the wedding which the king had prepared for his
son, or to the great meal which, it is written, a certain man had prepared and
to which he had invited many people. It was, we are told, because of this that
the head of the household—who had every right to feel indignant—turned away
even men of the highest rank and substituted others in their place. Hence the
older son, and the ancient people of the Synagogue who are represented in the
person of Queen Vashti, refused to leave their dwelling, i.e. to be parted from
the letter of the Law, but were rather content to live by their own judgment
which they would exercise for the satisfaction of their earthly desires. They
were exiled far from the homeland of the Holy Spirit and the counsel of the
Father, forever brittle and hard, full of rancor and indignation; they are the
one who says: “I have bought a field, and I need to go out and see it; I ask
you to excuse me” (Luke 14). The one who purchases five yoke of oxen is weighed
down by the burden of the Law while enjoying the pleasures of our earthly
senses; the one who has gotten married and cannot come to the wedding, and
having been made flesh can never be one with the spirit—the character of this
man is much like that of the workers in the parable in which they are sent to
the vineyard at the first, the third, the sixth, and the ninth hour, i.e. they were
hired at different times. So they are indignant that the workers hired at the
eleventh hour are being paid the same amount as they are. But let us hear what
Scripture has to say about the stubbornness of Vashti, that most foolish of
queens: “So the king was angered, and enflamed by his excessive rage he
questioned his wise men, who were always at his side according to royal custom;
and he used to do whatever they advised him, since they knew the laws and the
rules of the ancestors. And in the first and second place were Carshena,
Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven leaders of
Persia and Media who would see his face and whose authority was normally second
only to his own; and it was to their judgment that Queen Vashti was subject
when she did not want to obey the command of King Ahasuerus given to her
through the eunuchs. And as the king and his officials listened to him, Memucan
said: ‘Vashti has injured not only the king, but all the officials and peoples
who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. For her words will go out to
all the women, so that they will despise their husbands and say: “King
Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti to come to him, and she did not want to.” And
with this example, all the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will hold
cheap the authority of their husbands; so that the king’s indignation is just.
And if it pleases you, let an edict go forth from your face, and let it be
written according to the law of Persia and Media— which it is forbidden to
ignore—that Vashti may no longer come into the king’s presence, but that her
reign should be given to another who is better than her.’” Now, when Vashti
shows her arrogance, King Ahasuerus seeks the advice of the seven wise men who
are always at his side according to royal custom, and commands that their
judgment about her should be carried out; and this can only mean that our
Savior— through his learned men who are filled with the grace of the Holy
Spirit, and always take care to stand in his presence with upright faith and
good works—bases his verdict upon the stubbornness of the Jewish people who are
guilty of punishing and condemning him. He ruled, in other words, that they
should be driven from the seat of the king, i.e. from their relationship with
God for which they were ordained and chosen; and that another, better
people—namely, the Church of the nations—should take its place in genuine faith
and full devotion. So the Lord promised by the Law and the prophets shows in
the Gospel itself that he was destined, at the behest of the Father, to summon
Judea when he says: “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
(Matthew 15)”; and likewise: “It is not good to take the bread of children and
toss it to the dogs” (ibid.). But when the gentile woman continues to petition
him, the Lord himself rightly praises her great faith; and elsewhere the faith
of the centurion is shown preference over the faith of the Jews, when he says:
“Amen, I tell you, many will come from the East and the West and will recline
with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven; while the children of
this kingdom will be cast into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 8). Likewise, in another passage the Truth
herself says to Jerusalem: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill your prophets and
you stone those who were sent to you; how often have I wanted to gather your
children, like the hen gathers her chicks beneath her wings, but you did not
want me to. See, your house will be left to you desolate” (Luke 13). Moreover,
after his resurrection he commanded his disciples as follows about summoning
the nations: “Go and teach all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to keep everything I
have ordered you to do. And see, I myself am with you for all the days until
the very end of the age” (Matthew 28). It is also fitting that he was
publishing his decision about Vashti through Memucan, who is mentioned last in
the series of seven wise men, because he symbolizes the persona of the apostle
Paul who was the last to be called as an apostle, and through whom the Jews are
properly reproached for their faithlessness. For he says about himself: “But I
am the least of the apostles” (1 Corinthians 15).And elsewhere he says: “To me,
the least among the saints, has been given this grace, so that I might
evangelize Christ among the nations” (2 Corinthians 3). So while he had been
preaching the word of God together with Barnabas in the Synagogue of the Jews,
and the Jews—who were full of zeal— were speaking out blasphemously against
what Paul was saying, he said to them firmly: “It was proper that the word of
God should first be spoken to you; but since you reject it, and judge yourselves
undeserving of eternal life, see we are turning to the nations. For so the Lord
has commanded us: ‘I placed you as a light for the nations, so that you may
bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ And hearing this, the nations
rejoiced, and they glorified the word of the Lord, and whoever had been
preordained for eternal life believed” (Acts 13).</span><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

was Esther the daughter of the brother of Mordecai the Jew, whom he, as her
uncle, was raising with conscientious care.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“After these things had
happened and the king's indignation had cooled, he remembered Vashti and what
she had done, or what she had suffered. And the king's young men and his
ministers said: “Let us find for the king virgin girls, and let them be brought
to the city of Shushan and placed in the women's house under the hand of Hegai
the eunuch, who is in charge of and guards the king's women; and let them be
given the cosmetic treatments of women, and the other things necessary for
their use. And whichever one among them all may please the eyes of the king
shall rule in place of Vashti.” When, therefore, Judea had been repulsed from
its relationship with the king, various nations—and the various inhabitants of
particular nations from the various parts of the world—were brought in to
receive a share in the royal grandeur through the holy preachers, who were
ministers of the words of the Gospel. And they were placed under the hand of
Hegai, meaning quick or customary, who was in charge of the king's women; that
is, under the care of the shepherds and rulers of the Church to whom the
governance of the souls of the faithful was committed, so that they might be
able to offer them, in word and by example, whatever they needed for the
cultivation of righteousness. And so whatever souls pleased the eyes of the
inner breast in proper faith and pure conscience would be brought, pure and
holy, to the bed of the eternal king in place of the stubborn and shameless
Vashti who had been cast out. “There was a Jewish man in the city of Shushan by
the name of Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish of
the line of Jemin, who was brought there from Jerusalem at the time when
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had brought Jeconiah the king of Judah; he
was the guardian of his brother's daughter Hadassah, who was also called
Esther. She had lost both her parents, and was very beautiful and had a lovely
face. And when her mother and father died, Mordecai adopted her as his
daughter. And when the king's order had been publicized, and many beautiful
virgins were brought to Shushan in accordance with his command and were handed
over to Hegai the eunuch, Esther was also handed over along with the other
girls to do her service among the women. And she pleased him, and found favor
in his sight; and he ordered the eunuch to hasten her cosmetic treatments, and
to give her his own share of food, and seven beautiful girls from the king’s
house; and to adorn and beautify both her and her attendants.” Now, what can
Esther—whose name means hidden, and who was also called Hadassah, i.e.
mercy—signify if not the Church of the nations, which pleases God in the
recesses of its heart because its faith is pure, and it finds before the eyes
of God more mercy and grace than the Synagogue of the Jews which the prophet
Hosea rightly calls “No-mercy” on account of its wickedness. So the spiritual
Mordecai adopts her as his daughter, because she had lost both her parents; and
what can Mordecai signify if not the teachers of the nations, and especially
the blessed apostle Paul who was also, we are told, from the line of Jemin,
i.e. from the tribe of Benjamin? He too was entrusted with the Church of the
nations after the call of God transformed him from a persecutor into an
apostle; and after the deaths of her father and her mother—that is, the errors
and superstitions of the gentiles—he made her in a sense his own when, through
the grace of baptism and the word of the Gospels, he sired anew a daughter for
the all-powerful Father for eternal salvation. Hence he said to them: “Though
you might have many masters, you do not have many fathers; for I sired you in
Christ through the Gospel” (1 Corinthians 4). She was, therefore, been taken
into captivity at one time by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, when—because
of the Devil—she was taken from natural law and the worship of one God to the
confusion of idolatry. Yet God’s righteousness never abandoned her, and in fact
called her back to the path of truth by means of his preachers, who looked
after her with great care and brought her up in complete righteousness, justice
and truth. For her, Hegai the eunuch—i.e. the chaste order of pastors—prepared
the cosmetics of women, that is, healthful doctrine and examples of good works;
and he gave her his own share of food, which was actually the knowledge of
Scripture and an upright character. He also arranged for her seven beautiful
girls as attendants, in that he adopted—for the sake of giving her a very
beneficial apprenticeship—more of the faithful who were reborn through the
grace of the sevenfold Holy Spirit and likewise took up good works. In other
words, she would therefore be found suitable in every way for the couch of the
eternal king, adorned as she was with a flourishing faith and the glow from

disclose her people and her country; for Mordecai had ordered her to say
nothing about this matter.” That is, the Church of the nations, which was
instructed in the precepts of the sacred teachers, does not want to betray the
place of her country and people because now that she has been cleansed through
baptism of all the pollution born of sin and the filth of idolatry, she can no
longer endure in any form the shame of her original impiety. Moreover, the Lord
is also commanding her through his prophet, when he says: “Listen daughter, and
see, and lend your ear, and forget your people and your father’s home, because
the king has desired your beauty, because he is the Lord your God” (Psalms 45).
So it follows that Scripture demonstrates through the figure of Mordecai the
cleverness of the leaders, when it says:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“He would stroll every
day in front of the forecourt of the house where the chosen virgins were
serving, expressing his concern for Esther’s welfare and wanting to know what
was happening to her.” Because every day the sacred teachers take care to keep
watch, venturing out to teach the Gospel so that they might examine the faith
and the works of the people entrusted to them, to see if they are following
with attentive concern the rule of proper faith through which we obtain eternal
salvation; or if they are diligent about worshipping God and doing good works,
which is how we may win the reward of the heavenly kingdom in the life to come.
For those whose hearts burn incessantly with the heat of proper faith and the
fire of divine love cannot be free of this concern for even an hour. Hence when
the teacher of the nations glories in his labors and in the persecutions which
he suffered for Christ, he adds as follows: “And in addition to any secondary
concerns, I am faced every day with my concern for all the churches. Who is
weak without my being weak? Who is offended without my being disturbed?” (2 Corinthians
11) And to the Romans: “God, whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of his
Son, is my witness that I remember you in my prayers always, and without
interruption” (1 Romans).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

come for each of the girls to enter in order the presence of the king, a period
of twelve months had gone by while everything that had to do with the
refinement of women was completed; that is, for six months they were anointed
with oil of myrrh, and for another six they used certain pigments and scents.”
Now, why is it that the girls who were to be brought into the king’s bedchamber
were prepared for twelve months with oil and scent, i.e. for six months they
were anointed with oil of myrrh (which is known to have a pleasant odor) and
for another six they used various pigments and scents? It must be that all the
souls who are invited to receive the gift of holy baptism and to enter the bed
of the true Groom, i.e. Christ the king, are thoroughly imbued by oil of
myrrh—i.e. by the light of faith and the salve of love—with the scents of the
virtues, so that they will deserve to be worthy of his company. For what are
the holy preachers doing when they instruct their catechumens in the truth of
the faith, if not teaching them to adorn that faith with good works so that
with fasting, prayer and charity, and with other works of virtue, they may
quickly wash away the original filth of the old man and clothe themselves in
the elegance of the new one. We read, after all, in the Acts of the Apostles
that the centurion Cornelius had first pleased God with prayer and charity, and
then when Peter arrived he received the purification of baptism and the
sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Hence it adds:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And when they went in to
the king, they would receive whatever they requested for their adornment; and
once they were made up as they liked, they would cross over from the dining
room of the women to the king’s bedchamber.” For any soul that strives to hurry
to the bed of the heavenly Groom receives from its teachers the adornment that
is appropriate to it, and with which it shows itself more devoted to the
understanding of the faith and the knowledge of virtue, so that—by the intact
faith of the holy Trinity and full confession—it may go forth from among the
postulants to receive the sole baptism and anointment with the holy oil, when
it is genuinely united with the heavenly Groom.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

would enter in the evening and leave in the morning, and was then brought to
the second building”—and so on, proves in an allegorical way that after our
vices have subsided, the glow of our virtues (which will not shine properly
anywhere but in the unity of the holy Church) ought to rise. And yet one who
has sequestered himself from it because he has some foul odor of error or vice
is quite rightly kept from being brought to the second building where the
king’s concubines were waiting, because a decline in robust faith deserves not
a advance in but a restoration of respect; and he will no longer have such an
authorization to return to our king until he has been visited once again by
celestial grace, and restored through his calling to his original dignity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“When, moreover, in the
course of time the day arrived in turn when Esther the daughter of Abichail the
brother of Mordecai, whom he had adopted as his daughter, was supposed to go in
to the king, she did not ask for the treatments given to women; rather, Hegai
the eunuch, the guardian of the virgins, gave her whatever adornment he thought
she should have. For she was very shapely, and in her incredible beauty she
appeared gracious and lovely to all who saw her.” It says “in the course of
time,” i.e. once the five ages of the world—during which the posterity of the
Fathers was gaining ground, and the institution of the Law was flourishing
among the Jews—had come to an end, and a sixth age was at hand when, with the
arrival of the Redeemer, a multitude from among the nations would be brought
together through the Gospel. For it was then that Esther in the allegorical
sense, i.e. the Church, was being brought from among the nations to Christ the
king through the apostles’ preaching, and by means of the belief of robust
faith and the sacrament of baptism; she was shapely, and in the incredible
beauty of her virtues she appeared gracious and lovely to all who saw her. The
apostle Paul mentions this period when he writes to the Galatians, as follows:
“After the fullness of time had come, God sent his own Son born from a woman,
made under the Law so that he might redeem those who were under the Law, so
that we might receive the adoption given to children” (Galatians 4). And to the
Ephesians: “God, who is rich in mercy, revived us together with Christ by whose
grace you were saved, because of the great charity with which he loved us even
though we were dead through our sins; and he revived us with him, and had us
sit with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus to show in the ages to come the
abundant riches of his grace in his goodness toward us in Christ Jesus”
(Ephesians 2). Hence we should also bear in mind the crucial moment when Esther
was brought to the king’s bedchamber:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So she was brought to
the bedchamber of King Ahasuerus in the tenth month, which is called Tevet, in
the seventh year of his reign; and the king loved her more than all the women,
and placed the diadem of kingship on her head, and had her rule in place of
Vashti.” For Tevet is that month in the Hebrew calendar which corresponds to
the Greek Eudymos and the Latin Januarius, when the Lord incarnate was
circumcised on the eighth day and was adored even as a tiny infant by the Magi,
who were brought there by a star that led the way, and honored as God, man and
king with the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh that were offered to him.
This was also the month when he was heralded and baptized by John. So in the
seventh year of Ahasuerus, Esther went up to the king’s bed; and the Church was
brought to and joined with the king Christ, in whom she remains without change
by the grace of the sevenfold Spirit. “Whom he loved more than all the women;”
and she had before him grace and mercy above all women, that is, above all the
nations of the world. “He placed on her head the diadem of kingship,” when he
summoned her as his consort in kingship; “and he had her rule in place of
Vashti,” i.e. the Synagogue of the Jews which lost its place of honor when it
spurned and crucified our king. That is, the prophet is looking at the
excellence of this queen when he says to Christ the king: “The queen stood at
your right hand in golden robes, cloaked in colorful clothing” (Psalms 45). And
right after that, he speaks to her as follows: “Listen daughter, and see, and
lend your ear, and forget your people and your father’s home, because the king
has desired your beauty. He is the Lord your God, and the daughters of Tyre
will adore him; with gifts all the wealthy among the people will seek your
face” (ibid.).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And he ordered that a
greatly magnificent feast be prepared for all his officials and slaves in honor
of his union and marriage with Esther, and gave a respite to all the provinces,
and showered them with gifts as befits the generosity of a ruler.” Now, what
can “prepare a greatly magnificent feast for all his officials and slaves in
honor of his marriage with Esther” mean, if not that everyone throughout the
world, from the greatest to the least, celebrates with the greatest joy the
spiritual union of Christ and the Church? After all, at this feast it is not
meals of the flesh that the celebrants have the honor to consume, but the
spiritual dishes of wisdom and virtue. It is there that all of the faithful
receive—for the sake of restoring their salvation—the sanctified mysteries of
the body and blood of the Lord; and there that the fodder of eternal life is
stored. Our king gives a respite to all the provinces, and bestows gifts of
many kinds, when he frees those who believe in him from the burden of sin, and
repays them with spiritual gifts. That is why he himself says in the Gospel:
“Come to me all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will restore you. Take
my yoke upon yourselves, and learn from me because I am mild and humble of
heart, and you will find rest in your souls” (Matthew 11). The prophet as well
says about this: “When he went up on high he led captivity away captive; he
gave gifts to men” (Psalms 68). That is why the apostle adds to this: “And he
made some of them apostles, others prophets, still others evangelists, and
others pastors and teachers for finishing the training of the saints for the
work of ministry, for building the body of Christ until we all arrive at the
unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, at the complete man, at the
measure of the age at which Christ reaches his fullness” (Ephesians 4).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And when virgins were
sought for a second time and gathered together, Mordecai was staying at the

she had been accustomed to do when he was raising her as a small girl.” Virgins
are being sought for the king a second time and gathered together, because it
was not enough for our Lord Jesus Christ to associate himself exclusively with
the Jewish members of the early Church; rather he also acquired through his
preachers copious numbers of the faithful from among the nations so that a
single catholic Church would arise from both peoples, namely his most noble
bride who has no blemishes or wrinkles. Hence he himself says in the Gospels:
“And I have other sheep which are not from this fold, and it is right that I
should lead them; and they will listen to my voice, and there will be one fold
and one shepherd” (John 10). “Mordecai was staying at the king’s door,” because
the holy teachers who are persistently committed to teaching the Gospel call
together the nations to the entryway of faith and the sacrament of baptism; and
our Esther had still not betrayed her country and her people in keeping with
the order of Mordecai the prefiguration because in keeping with the doctrine of
faith, the Church of the saints never does anything out of arrogance but rather
obeys—humbly and in pure conscience—everything commanded her by the
aforementioned evangelists. And it is about her that the prophet says: “All the
glory of the king’s daughter from within” (Psalms 45). And the apostle says:
“She is our glory, the testimony of our conscience” (2 Corinthians 1).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

eunuchs who wanted to kill the king were turned in by Mordecai and punished as
they deserved.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So while Mordecai was
staying at the king’s door, Bigthan and Teresh—two of the king’s eunuchs, who
were doorkeepers and presided over the first rank in the palace— became angy
and decided to rise up against the king and kill him. Mordecai found out about
this and immediately told Queen Esther, and she told king in the name of
Mordecai who had brought the matter to her attention.” Now, what can these two
eunuchs, who were doorkeepers of the royal house and presided over the first
rank in the palace, symbolize if not the scribes and the Pharisees of the Jews
about whom it is said that though they had the key to knowledge, they did not
enter themselves and would not allow anyone else to enter. These men decided to
rise up against the king and kill him because they constantly envied the
teachings and virtues of the Savior and so decided to plot against him; and together
with the administrators of Roman rule they were trying to kill him in some way.
Hence we read in the Gospel that “the Pharisees went out and hatched a plot to
catch him with his words; and they sent their disciples to him along with the
Herodians, saying ‘Master, we know that you are truthful and you teach the way
of God in truth; and that you do not concern yourself with anyone because you
show no regard for a man’s status. Tell us, then, what you think—should one pay
taxes to Caesar, or not (Matthew 22)?’” And elsewhere it is written that “the
chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a council, and they said ‘what shall
we do? Because this man does many wonders, if we let him go like this everyone
will believe in him, and the Romans will come and do away with our place and
our nation’” (John 11). Hence a bit after that, he adds: “So from that day
forth they determined to kill him” (ibid.). The prophet Isaiah is alluding to
these two characters when he mentions the two houses in which the Savior incarnate
became a stone to trip against and a rock to stumble over, a snare and a trap
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem on which many of them will stumble and fall,
and be bruised, and ensnared, and caught. So our Mordecai, who knew about the
wickedness of these eunuchs, turned them into the king through Esther, because
the order of preachers shows the faithful—who are the limbs of Christ—how to be
on guard against the deceit and the depravity of these men. These two eunuchs
might also represent the character of heretics and schismatics who, because
they carry in their hearts the poison of deception and wickedness, attack the
truth by assiduously constructing evil schemes for removing it from the hearts
of believers, and somehow killing within them Christ who is the life of the
faithful. But the sacred teachers, who illuminate the sinfulness of these men,
expose to the light the darkness of their errors by showing how the innocent
are rescued from the death of the soul because God has pointed them out; how
the guilty are punished with just vengeance; and how those who deserve it are
repaid with the appropriate reward. Then it adds: “And it was investigated, and
discovered, and both men were hung on a gibbet; and the king commanded that it
be written in the record book that he should be repaid somehow for saving his
life; and it was set down in the accounts, and recorded in the chronicles
before the king.” The “record books” are, then, the volumes of the two
Testaments which set down the rewards that await the righteous in return for
their good deeds, and the punishments that await the wicked for their sins.
Hence it is written in the Gospel: “The son of man is going to come in the
glory of his Father, and will then repay each one according to his works”
(Matthew 16). And likewise, “The wicked will come to eternal punishment, while
the just come to eternal reward” (Matthew 25). Hence Paul as well writes to the
Romans as follows: “For the wrath of God is unleashed upon all the wickedness
and injustice of men, who repress in their injustice the truth of God who
repays each according to his works; and those who seek glory, honor, and purity
by patiently doing good deeds will receive eternal life, while those who trust
in wickedness, because they are contentious and will not acquiesce to the
truth, will receive wrath and indignation. There will be trouble and distress
for every soul of an evildoer” (Romans 1 and 2). Ezekiel as well speaks about
this: “The justice of the just man will be upon him, and the wickedness of the
wicked man will be upon him. When a soul has sinned, it will die” (Ezekiel 18).
The Psalmist also refers to this in the same terms: “The eyes of the Lord are
upon the just, and his ears attend to their prayers; the face of the Lord is
upon those who do evil, that he may wipe their memory from the earth” (Psalms
33).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

about them to the king who ordered them all to be killed on a single day.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Ahasuerus raised up Haman the son of Hamedatha, who was of the line of Agag,
and placed his seat above all of his officials. And all the king’s slaves who
lived within the doors of the palace were kneeling and paying homage to Haman,
for so their emperor had commanded them; only Mordecai would not kneel or pay
homage to him.” Now, what could the arrogant Haman symbolize if not the
haughtiness of the powerful of this world, who exploit the benefactions
conferred on them in the name of godly piety even as they disdain to treat
their neighbors—who share their lot in nature—as partners in their good
fortune? That is why they wickedly attempt to direct toward themselves the
honor and reverence which should properly be paid to God alone; and they
persecute with hatred, pursue with torments, and even try to have killed anyone
who refuses to do or agree to this. But the supreme judge, “who looks down upon
the humble but recognizes the haughty from far away; who knows the deceiver and
he who is deceived, turns the grief caused by the wicked back upon their heads,
and their wickedness comes down on the tops of their heads. The unjust are
caught in their own traps; the just man is freed from his constraints; and the
wicked man is put in his place” (Psalms 138 and 7). It may also be that this
Haman the Agagite, who according to Josephus was descended from the line of
Amalek, prefigures the bloody people of the Jews who killed their prophets and
were not afraid to kill even the Lord of the prophets and his apostles. It was
when they lost the nobility of their race because of their disbelief and
hardness of heart that Isaiah called them the princes of Sodom and the people
of Gomorrah; and Ezekiel tells them: “Your father was an Amorite, and your
mother a Hittite” (Ezekiel 16). Hence these proclaimers of Christ regard them
as enemies of the law of God. So they rush to lay their hands not only on
Mordecai, that is, on the preachers of the Gospel, but also on the entire
catholic people, and to wipe them out from this life; and yet the death they
were scheming to inflict upon the innocent in this world they are forced to
endure endlessly within their souls because their own actions demand it, and a
just judge is paying them back.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And Haman said to King
Ahasuerus: ‘There is a people, scattered throughout the provinces and separate
from one another; they make use of new kinds of laws and ceremonies, and they
spurn the king’s rulings besides. And you know full well that it would do your
rule no good to give them the license to grow insolent. If it pleases you,
issue the decree that it should perish, and I will weigh out ten thousand
talents for the treasurers of your stores.’ So the king took from his hand the
ring which he used, and gave it to Haman the son of Hamedatha of the line of
Agag, the enemy of the Jews; and he said to him: ‘The silver which you promised
is yours; and as for the people, do as you like.’” So Haman promised ten
thousand talents of silver to the king, and asked for the death of the Jews;
and so too the Jewish people, who were dedicated to the fleshly observance of
the rites of the Law in the belief that they were pleasing God in this way,
planned the death of the true witnesses to Christ who were performing their
spiritual service to God in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels. And
just as Haman, when he sent his letters, took care to enforce them with the
king’s seal because this would make it easier for him to carry out his wishes,
the faithlessness of the Jews wrongly exploited—as evidence for their
heresy—the books of divine law in which the seal of the supreme king is
impressed, that is, the grace of the Holy Spirit is made manifest. This they
did in their effort to denounce the conversion of the nations to a fellowship
of faith, and to condemn the Gospel of Christ as something contrary to God’s
precepts.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Nor is it merely a
straightforward fact that it was the twelfth month of the year, which is called
Adar, that was set aside by lot for the murder of Israel; it signifies rather
that the grace of Christ, which has been entrusted to the faithful in the
fullness of time, is going to experience a harsh persecution in this world in
the last days, carried out upon the faithful. This is what the teacher of the
nations is also writing about when he says to Timothy: “And let it be known
that in the last days we will face dangerous times; and men will be lovers of
themselves, greedy, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to their parents,
ungrateful, wicked, emotionless, implacable, slanderers, unrestrained, harsh,
without kindness, treacherous, reckless, bombastic, loving their pleasures more
than they do God; and though they will have the appearance of righteousness,
they will deny its power.” Hence the Lord also says in the Gospel: “This
evangel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world as a
testimony to all the nations, and then the end will arrive” (Matthew 24). And a
bit after that: “Then there will be great tribulation, of a sort there has not
been since the beginning of the world till now; but it will not happen unless
those days have been cut short” (ibid.).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

immediately issued in Shushan; and the king and Haman were attending the feast
while all the Jews in the city were crying.” This is what the Savior preached to
his disciples in the Gospel: “Amen, amen I say to you that you will cry and
weep, while the world rejoices; and though you will be sad, your sadness will
turn to joy” (John 16). So let us see what Scripture goes on to tell us about
Mordecai.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

these things he tore his clothing , and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled ashes
on his head and cried out loudly in the boulevard in the middle of the city,
showing the bitterness of his soul. And wailing in this way he made his way to
the doors of the palace; for it was not allowed to enter the king’s court while
wearing sackcloth etc.” When Mordecai hears that the slaughter of the Jews has
been fixed by imperial decree, he dresses himself in somber clothing and
approaches the doors of the palace with a bitter soul and a wailing voice; and
when the leaders of the Church hear about the persecution which the princes of
the earth desire to inflict upon the blameless slaves of Christ, they long to
pour out their troubles—with fasting and charity, with vigils and prayer, with
tears and the devotion of the heart—to the hidden recesses of Heaven, i.e. in the
sight of the supreme judge. So in light of the honor and the prayers of the
true queen, i.e. the holy Church which even now wanders the earth for some of
the time, and rules with the Lord in Heaven for the rest, they deserve to be
heard by the king of all ages. If, moreover, one were to ask how it might befit
a just king to inflict torments on the innocent, he should know that the source
of this is not some desire to do harm but the intention of the highest
providence; for the divine wisdom—which conquers every sort of wickedness and
reaches powerfully from one end to the other, and disposes everything with
ease—does whatever it wishes in Heaven and on earth, on the sea and in all the
depths. It is, in other words, with just judgment that his faithful servants
are delivered into the hands of the persecutors, whether to expiate their sins
or to correct their behavior or even to add to their merits or multiply their
rewards, since— as the prophet testifies—“the Lord is just in all his ways, and
holy in all his acts; he is close to all who call upon him” (Psalms 145). In
truth, he will do the will of those who fear him, and will listen to their
prayers and bring them salvation; for the Lord did not deliver Job into Satan’s
hands to destroy him because he asked him to, but so that with Job’s help he
could defeat his most wicked enemy and so acquire for himself the palm of
victory, and leave to that enemy the just punishment for his wickedness. The
apostle Paul was subjected to a corporal goad, namely the angel of Satan, who
pummeled him so that his virtue would be perfected in a state of weakness. We
should also be careful not to pass over in silence the statement that Mordecai
could not enter the royal court because he had put on sackcloth, but instead
got as far as the doors of the palace; because no one who has been polluted by
the life of this world may enter the court of the heavenly realm, rather each
of us should, before the last day of his life, knock on the entrance of the
kingdom by chastising his body and repenting in his heart for as long as he is
here. And this way, he will be fortunate to enter the paradise of the Lord
after he has passed into death.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So Esther sent this
message to Mordecai: “Go and gather all the Jews you find in Shushan, and pray
for me. Do not eat and do not drink for three days and three nights. And I will
likewise fast together with my maids; and then I will go in to the king without
being summoned, though that is against the law.” Mordecai prays with the Jews
on behalf of Queen Esther, and the queen likewise prays for Mordecai and the
Jews, because a teacher ought to offer prayers to the Lord on behalf of his
students, and students on behalf of their teachers, that the entire community
of the faithful—i.e. the limbs along with the whole body—may be kept whole
through the kindness of Heaven. This explains why, when Paul writes to the
Romans, he tells them that he constantly mentions them in his prayers; and he
also makes these same Romans swear on the Lord Jesus Christ, and on the charity
of the Holy Spirit, that they would help him in their prayers and pray for him
to the Lord that he might be freed from the faithless who were in Judea, and
that his ministry—which he was bringing to Jerusalem—might be acceptable to the
saints. So too is it written in the Acts of the Apostles that when Peter was
thrown in jail, the Church prayed constantly to the Lord on his behalf; and he
himself likewise asks in his letter that the grace of God, and the peace of the
Church, may be multiplied and fulfilled in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And on the third day
Esther dressed in royal garments, and stood in the courtyard of the king’s
house which was inside opposite the king’s basilica; while he was sitting on
his throne in the audience-hall of the palace, opposite the entrance of the
house. And when he saw Queen Esther standing there she was pleasing to his
eyes, and he extended to her the golden staff he was holding in his hand. And
she approached him, and kissed the tip of his staff; and the king said to her:
‘What do you wish, Queen Esther, what is your request? Even if you ask for half
of the kingdom, it will be given to you.’ But she answered: ‘I beg you to come
to me today, and Haman with you, to a feast.” What can it mean that on the
third day Esther dressed in royal garments, if not that in the third age of the
world—i.e. after the incarnation, passion and resurrection of Christ—the Church
of the nations dressed herself in faith, hope and charity, and in the beauty of
all the virtues, to receive the sacraments of baptism through the confession of
the holy Trinity so that she would then be worthy of the king’s company, since
she was burning incessantly with a special love for him? She stands in the
courtyard of the king’s house which was inside, opposite the king’s basilica,
i.e. in the righteous works of this life which looks toward future compensation
in Heaven, where the king himself sits on his celestial throne and assents to
the prayers of those who piously cry out to him. He extends to this queen the
staff he holds in his hand when he shows her the power of his rule, or rather
the cross of his passion through which he has acquired for himself power in
Heaven, on earth, and below the earth; so that “in his name every
creature—celestial, terrestrial and infernal—shall bend his knee.” In fact, she
kisses this staff lovingly, that is, she reveres it with total devotion. And
the king himself pledges that he will agree to her request, just as he says in
the Gospel: “Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock
and it shall be opened to you” (Matthew 7). And likewise: “Seek and you will
receive, so that your joy may be complete.” For complete joy is given to the
holy Church solely in the sense that it partakes in the kingdom of Heaven,
where the fortunate queen will rule forever with Christ the king. And yet once
she is allowed to choose her request, she invites him to the feast she has
prepared for him; though this can best be understood as that complete and
perfect devotion to her faith upon which the observer and arbiter of all the
ages nourishes himself within. Of course, the Church invites to this
refreshment, i.e. to this communion of vigorous faith, not only her friends but
even her enemies and persecutors, namely pagans, Jews and heretics, so
that—leaving behind the isolation of complete error—they may rejoice in the
common good in the single home of catholic belief.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And the king said right
away: ‘Call Haman so that he may obey the will of Esther;’ so the king and
Haman came to the feast which the queen had prepared for them.” Notice that the
will of the queen when she invites them is at one with the order issued by the
king; but woe to anyone who approaches with evil intent the table of the Lord,
who has a breast marred by hatred and an impure conscience and so does not fear
to enter the feast of the Lord even though he is unworthy. And even when he has
often been invited and has come, he will not linger amid the joyousness of the
feasters because his faults force him to leave; but when the king comes in to
see him lying there without having dressed in wedding clothes, he chastises him
for his arrogance and orders his men to tie his hands and feet and throw him
into the outer darkness, where he is rightly forced to suffer the harm he was
wickedly planning to inflict on the innocent; as Solomon tells us: “The wicked
are caught in their own traps.” So after the king once again gives Esther the
chance to make a request, she responds as follows: “If I have found favor in
the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to give me what I ask and
fulfill my request, may the king and Haman come to the feast which I have
prepared for them, and tomorrow I will surrender my will to the king.” The fact
that she puts off her request should be attributed not to the vice of laziness,
but to the virtue of patience; it signifies, in other words, that in the future
rewards will be given to the righteous, but punishment to the sinner. For
tomorrow means here a future time, as it does in the Gospel passage “Do not
concern yourselves about tomorrow.” And in Genesis, Jacob says to Laban:
“Tomorrow my justice will appear.” In Exodus as well, where the commandment to
eat the paschal lamb is given, it adds: “And nothing of it will remain till the
morning.” When, moreover, the day of future judgment arrives, and the entire
human race– i.e. both the righteous and the sinners—is stood in the presence of
the supreme Judge, the intent with which a person has lived in this world will
be revealed; and there the righteous are invited by a verdict of the judge who
sits before them to partake in the kingdom of their heavenly homeland, and the
sinners are expelled to be punished, together with the Devil, with the torments
of Hell.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

histories and chronicles of earlier times; and while these were being read to

against him. So the king summoned Haman and commanded him to adorn Mordecai
with the king’s robes and diadem; and that this same Haman should place him on
the king’s horse and proclaim him a friend of the king. Then Haman returned to
his house in sorrow.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And the king spent that
night awake, and ordered the histories and chronicles of earlier times to be
brought to him. And when these were being read in his presence, they came to
the place where it was written how Mordecai had revealed the treachery of the
eunuchs Bigthan and Teresh, who wanted to kill King Ahasuerus. And when the
king had heard this, he said: ‘What sort of honor and reward has Mordecai
received for this loyalty?’ And his slaves and ministers said to him: ‘He has
gotten no reward at all.’ Then the king said: ‘Who is that in the courtyard?’
So Haman, of course, entered the inner court of the king’s house to suggest to
the king that he order Mordecai nailed to the gibbet which he had prepared for
him. And the young men answered: ‘Haman is standing in the courtyard;’ and the
king said ‘Let him come in.’ And when he came in, he said to him: ‘What should
be done for a man whom the king wishes to honor?’ So Haman, considering this in
his heart and concluding that the wanted to honor no one but himself, answered:
‘The man whom the king wishes to honor should be dressed in the king’s
garments, and placed on a horse which the king saddles, and the royal diadem
should be placed upon his head; and the first of the king’s officials and lords
should lead his horse, and walk down the boulevard of the city crying and
proclaiming ‘This is how anyone the king wants to honor will be honored.’ And
the king said to him:<span>  </span>‘Hurry and take
the robes and the horse, and do as you have said to Mordecai the Jew who is
sitting before the doors of the palace. Take care not to leave out any of the
things you have said.’” What can the fact that the king spent a sleepless night
mean but that which is written in the Psalm: “See, the one who guards Israel
will not sleep or slumber” (Psalms 121). They read before him the histories and
chronicles of earlier times in which are mentioned the loyalty and the good
deeds of Mordecai, because the king of the saints and the prince of the kings
of the earth—who remains the same within himself—comes to know with a single
glance the course of all the ages and the actions of every individual; and
nothing ever escapes his notice, rather everything lies open before him in his
sight. Jeremiah tells us about this: “For it is he who has strengthened all
things, and Israel is the staff of his inheritance; the Lord of hosts is his
name” (Jeremiah 10). Hence the apostle also says: “For in Christ Jesus there is
no ‘is’ and ‘was’, but in him there is always ‘is’.” And likewise: “Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday and today, and for all time” (Hebrews 13).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

fade from his memory; rather it is as it is written: “The righteous will be in

officials and lords should lead his horse, and walk down the boulevard of the
city crying “This is how anyone the king wants to honor will be honored.” After
all, the preachers of the sacred Gospel and the leaders of the Church, who
glisten with their practice of all the virtues and the beauty of wisdom
and—because they are the limbs of the supreme king—are nobly honored with the
diadem of royal rank, are ordered to mount the king’s horse, i.e. to take
charge of and govern the people of the faithful in whose hearts the king of
Heaven himself presides continuously. The Lord himself is told about these horses
by the prophet Habakkuk: “Going up you shall mount your horses, and your
horsemanship is salvation” (Habakkuk 3).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Haman, the spiritual enemy of the people of God, offers—if unwillingly—the
appropriate obeisance, since the persecutors of the holy Church are often
forced with the assent of Heaven to preach with accurate testimony the praises
of the Church, even though they do so in a spirit of disdain; because once the
truth has been revealed, the guilty cannot conceal what is obvious by hiding it
away.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the door of the palace and Haman hurried to his house, mournful and bareheaded;
and he told Zeresh his wife, and his friends, everything that had happened to
him. And to this the wise men he had in his house, and his wife, answered: ‘If
Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is from the seed of the Jews,
then you cannot resist him but you will fall in his sight.’” This is the change
in the right hand of the Most High, when someone who was only recently boasting
that he had power over others, and was more arrogant than anyone, suddenly
becomes more wretched than anyone else and weaker than all of them. It is the
magnitude of this phenomenon that Mary, the mother of the Lord, has in mind
when she says in her song in the Gospels: “He has made power in his arm, and
scattered the arrogant with the thought of his heart. He has dislodged the
powerful from their seats, and raised up the humble. He has sated the hungry
with good things, and sent the rich away empty-handed” (Luke 1). We are told
about this in Isaiah: “Lebanon will be turned into Carmel, and Carmel will be
regarded as a forest” (Isaiah 29).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

and reduced to nothing; and how those who proclaim Christ throughout the world
have been raised up in a state of vigorous faith and exalted through the power
of the virtues. The head has been turned into the tail and the tail into the
head, because “Everyone who exalts himself will be brought low; and everyone
who humbles himself will be exalted.”</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

speaking, the king’s eunuchs came in and made him proceed quickly to the feast
which the queen had prepared. So the king entered with Haman to drink with the
queen. And on the second day as well, the king said to her, after he had grown
heated from the wine: ‘What is your request, Esther, that I might give it to
you, and what do you wish to be done? Even if you ask for half my kingdom, you
will receive it.’ And she answered him: ‘If I have found favor in your eyes, O
king, and if it pleases you, give me my soul for which I ask, and my people for
whom I plead. For I and my people have been handed over to be crushed, to be
killed and to perish. And at least if we were sold as servants and maids it
would be a tolerable evil, and I would sigh but keep silent; but now our enemy
is one whose cruelty overflows onto the king.’ And King Ahasuerus answered her,
and said: “Who is he, and by whose authority would he dare to do this?’ Esther
said: ‘Our enemy, and our worst foe, is Haman;’ and when he heard this, he was
struck dumb on the spot and no longer could bear the faces of the king and the
queen.” Now, notice that Haman is now attending the second day just as he had
come before when he was summoned; and yet once Esther lays out her request, he
is condemned and goes off to his punishment. This explains the fact that in one
place in the Gospels is mentioned a lunch made by a person, and elsewhere a
dinner; since the lunch symbolizes the present Church, and the dinner the
eternal and final feast. Hence once the sinners have been removed, only the
good may rejoice in the sight of their creator.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

charity which would have made him worthy of the king’s feast, he realized that
the king was angry; and when the king rushed into the garden—that is, when he
invited his chosen ones to the delights of paradise—he tried to plead with the
queen for his own safety but in vain, since he could not find an opportune
moment for this. For once the penalty of vengeance is imminent, it is too late
to look for a means of salvation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

parable, the foolish virgins ask for oil to refill their lamps when the groom
is on his way, but do not receive it. So after the Groom has entered the
wedding with the wise virgins, and the door has been closed, the others remain
locked out and must look for a point of entry; but there is no way they can be
worthy of this, since they no longer find the opportunity for absolution which
they had earlier failed to seek out by doing the appropriate deeds.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

there what he asks from the Lord, if he did not listen here to what he was
ordered to do; once he has lost the chance to do the appropriate penance, in
vain does he come with his prayers before the door of the kingdom. This is, in
fact, the reason why the Lord says through Solomon: “I called and you refused;
I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; you despised all my counsel,
and you ignored my reproaches. I too will laugh at your destruction, and I will
mock you when that which you fear comes to pass; when sudden disaster
overwhelms you, and destruction assails you like a storm. Then they will call
on me but I will not listen; they will arise in the morning but will not find
me” (Proverbs 1).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

back to the banquet hall, he found that Haman had sunk down to the couch on
which Esther was lying, and he said: ‘He wants to conquer even the queen while
I am present in my own house.’ The king’s statement had not yet escaped his
mouth, and they immediately covered his face.” That is, Haman’s attempt to
beseech Queen Esther was regarded by King Ahasuerus as a ruse, because when the
day of judgment arrives the petitions of the wicked are seen not as prayer but
as provocation. Hence it is written in the Psalm: “When he is judged let him
leave condemned, and let his prayer become sin” (Psalms 109). For it is then
that the oppression with which they were crushing the humble is thrown back in
their faces, because the time of recompense is at hand; for then those who have
been condemned for their sins are covered in shame, as it is written: “The
confusion of their faces will cover them,” when they are dragged off to the
depths of Hell to be given a reward that suits their actions. Hence it also
adds:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

eunuchs who were attending the needs of the king, said: ‘Look, the tree which
he had prepared for Mordecai who spoke for the king is standing in the house of
Haman, fifty cubits high.’ To which the king replied: ‘Hang him upon it.’ So
Haman was hanged on the gibbet which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the
king’s wrath was placated.” It is written in Proverbs: “He who digs a pit will
fall into it; and when one starts a stone rolling it will roll back upon him”
(Proverbs 26). So too Haman was forced to suffer the cross he had prepared for
Mordecai.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We might, however, ask
what it means that, as we have read, the cross itself was made fifty cubits
high. For the Law had previously been given to the people on the fiftieth day
after a lamb was sacrificed on Mount Sinai; and given that we said before that
Haman signified the Jews themselves when they were rioting against Christ—who
had been promised to them in the Law—and persecuting his Church, the Law
itself, which had been given to them to safeguard their lives, became the cause
of their deaths because with it they had snuffed out the name of Christ and
tried mightily to kill those who professed him. In other words, those who
wanted by means of the Law to oppress the guiltless unjustly received through
it the verdict of a just judgment, about which we are told by Paul: “Whoever
has sinned in the Law will be judged through the Law” (Romans 2).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Moreover, Harbona the
eunuch, who handed over the actual cross that had been made, signifies the
teachers of the Law who brought to light—by reading the Law itself—the deceit
of the Jews and everything which they did contrary to the precepts of God.
Hence because Moses foresaw in the spirit the rebels and apostates who would
one day come to be, he predicted in his song in Deuteronomy everything that was
going to happen to sinners. So too the Savior says to the Jews themselves in
the Gospel: “Do not think that I am going to indict you before the Father—it is
Moses, in whom you hope, who accuses you; for if you believed in Moses you
would perhaps believe in me as well, for it is about me that he wrote. But if
you do not believe what he wrote, then how will you believe my words (John 5)?”</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman the enemy of the Jews. And
Mordecai went in before the face of the king,” etc. When King Ahasuerus gives
Queen Esther the house of Haman the enemy of the Jews, this must refer to the
fact that after the people spurned the arrival of the incarnate intermediary
between God and man and refused to accept his evangel, the true king and our
Lord put at the disposal of the holy Church all the dignity and honor which in
the past they had gotten from their knowledge of the Law and the prophets and
from their practice of righteous faith, so that the Church would possess
spiritual wealth and become the most respected guardian of all the virtues.
Hence it is written in Proverbs: “The wealth of the sinner is guarded by the
righteous” (Proverbs 13). And in the Gospel, the Lord says to the Jews
themselves: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation
that produces its fruits” (Matthew 21). This is also the reason for what
Solomon says: “He who is good receives favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 12).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">We are next told about
Mordecai that he went in before the face of the king, meaning that because the
Church praises and proclaims the dedication of its leaders, these sacred
teachers discover—in exchange for the effort they have exerted in nurturing the
faithful—abundant grace in the sight of the creator of all things. We might
also apply this principle to the characterization of all the persecutors of the
Church more generally, because whatever the latter produced in their eagerness
to acquire wisdom or useful disciplines; or sought out by investigating the
respectability of the virtues; or whatever sorts of punishments they devised to
torment the martyrs, it was all subverted by the faithful so as to magnify the
honor and the glory of Christ. Nor did the wicked possessors of these things
retain any of the good rewards that they earned for their labors, but
everything was transferred to the righteous to consummate their perfection. And
what follows this, where the king took the ring he had gotten from Haman and
gave it to Mordecai, is an allegorical expression of the fact that the seal of
faith, which the faithless Jews and all the persecutors of the name of Christ
did not want to accept when it was offered to them through the preaching of the
Gospel, was transferred to the nations by the apostles of Christ for the sake
of their salvation. So Esther holds onto the house of Haman the enemy of the
Jews, just as the Church of Christ possesses the world which was once the enemy
of Christianity. And Mordecai goes in before the face of the king because the
souls of the saints are taken every day from their homes in this life to
contemplate the visage of the supreme Judge; there is no limit to the measure
of their happiness—each day they experience ever more glory in the joy of
eternal exultation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And Esther appointed
Mordecai over her house.” So Esther appointed Mordecai over her house, because
it serves the beneficial intentions of the holy Church that great numbers of
the faithful might be placed under the government of the aforementioned saints
to be subjected—in humility and obedience—to the authority of their chosen
magistrates.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So not satisfied with
this, she fell at the feet of the king and cried, and pleaded with him to
command that the wickedness of Haman the Agagite, and the terrible schemes
which he had devised against the Jews, should be nullified. But he, in
accordance with the custom, held out in his hand the golden scepter which was
known to be a sign of mercy; and she rose to her feet, stood before him and
said: ‘If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his eyes, and my
pleadings do not seem unwelcome to him; then I beg that the earlier letters of
Haman the plotter and enemy of the Jews, in which he had ordered them to be
destroyed in all the king’s provinces, should be corrected by new ones. For how
could I bear the death and the murder of my people?’ And King Ahasuerus
answered Queen Esther, and Mordecai the Jew: ‘I have granted to Esther the
house of Haman, and ordered him nailed to a cross because he dared to lay a
hand on the Jews; so write to the Jews whatever you like in the name of the
king, and seal the letters with my ring.’” So when Esther falls at the feet of
the king and beseeches him for the sake of her people, this must refer to the
fact that every day the holy Church humbly petitions the Lord Almighty—through
the faith and mysteries of the incarnate, only-born Son of God—to free her
children so that through his grace, the arrogance of the enemy might be crushed
and the innocence of the faithful be freed from their hands. The supreme king
holds out his golden scepter toward the queen as she pleads with him, because
he is lavishing on her the mercy of his righteousness. She asks that the
earlier letters of the wicked Haman be replaced with new instructions, because
it is the fervent wish of the new queen that the followers of every error in
doctrine, and all the hostile machinations with which the ancient enemy tried
through its agents to exterminate the people of God, should be rejected and
destroyed by the thoroughly salutary writings of the Gospels. The letters
themselves are written in the name of the king and then sealed with his ring,
because the teaching of the Gospels—which are preached throughout the world in
the name of Christ—are declared everywhere to be confirmed by the seal of the
Holy Spirit, since the preachers themselves, who are filled with its gift, seem
to everyone to be undefeatable in their unflagging strength and to remain ever
glorious and triumphant over their enemies.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And it was the time of
the third month, which is called Sivan, on the twenty-third day of that month,
that letters were written as Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the leaders
and the governors, and to the judges who were in charge of the one hundred and
twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia; to province and province, to
people and people, according to their scripts and their languages, and to the
Jews however they could read and understand them. And these letters, which were
sent in the name of the king, were sealed with his ring and sent by couriers
who rode through all the provinces and preceded the earlier letters with their
new instructions.” The month of Sivan, which comes third after Nisan in the
Hebrew calendar, is the same one the Greeks call Thessaroi and the Romans
Junius. On the twenty-third day of that month new letters were dictated by
Mordecai in order to refute the earlier letters of Haman. The significance of
this is obvious—the teaching of the Gospel was framed by the writers of the New
Testament, under the direction of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that it would fully
encompass the faith in the holy Trinity, and the absolute perfection of the
entire Decalogue would be proven in the two commandments of charity. And by
means of the couriers—i.e. the sacred preachers—the Scripture itself is
directed toward the entire world, which is symbolized by the one hundred and
twenty-seven provinces that made up the realm of Ahasuerus, since the number
ten when multiplied by twelve makes one hundred and twenty; and if we were to
add another seven to this, it would allow us to complete the entire sum.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In the same way, the true
custodianship of the Decalogue within the apostolic tradition was imparted to
all parts of the world through the sacred teachers; whereas by the grace of the
sevenfold Spirit it was spread through the hearts of the faithful. It is
likewise of mystical significance that these letters which were sent in the
name of the king and were sealed with his ring were, we are told, written
according to the scripts and the languages of each and every nation, so that
each nation might be able to read and to understand; that is, the teaching of the
Gospels was ordained in such a way that its first teachers—who had been taught
through the grace of the Holy Spirit—spoke first in the words of all the
languages, and then the word of faith was seeded by their ministry through all
parts of the world. Hence we read in the Acts of the Apostles that in the
Cenacle of Zion, the Paraclete of the Spirit came over the one hundred and
twenty believers in the form of a fire and enabled them to declare in the
tongues of all the nations the marvels of God, so that those who gathered to
listen to them would all be struck dumb by this miracle.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So the king ordered them
to assemble the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather together to
fight for their lives and to kill all their enemies, together with their wives
and children and all their houses. And throughout the provinces a single day
was set aside for their vengeance, namely the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month of Adar. And the point of the letter was that among all the lands and
peoples that were subject to the authority of King Ahasuerus, it should be made
known that the Jews were ready to exact vengeance from their enemies.” So when
this earthly king orders his couriers to gather the Jews in each place, and to
command them to assemble so that they might fight for their lives and kill all
their enemies together with their wives and children and all their houses, this
can only mean that our king, who rules over all of Heaven and earth, is—through
his preachers—ordering the true Jews and their adherents throughout the nations
to assemble as a union of fellowship and peace; and to fight for the salvation
of their souls; and to condemn all their enemies both visible and invisible,
i.e. the false Jews who are the synagogue of Satan and the incorrigible pagans
and heretics, as well as the impure spirits with all their impieties and
perverse notions. Nor should they permit any remnant of these to survive, or
even their wives and children, i.e. they should wipe out completely the carnal
desires and the works of sinners together with their houses, namely with their
worldly ambitions; or allow to remain any offshoot of these things that could
pose a threat to them. So it is that in the Law, the Lord commanded the
Israelites to kill and to wipe out those nations in the Promised Land that were
antagonistic to them; so too he afterward commanded them to destroy the
Amalekites until they were all slaughtered, because he wanted to deprive them
of any occasion for misbehavior. This is what the prophet is thinking of when
he says in the Psalms: “In the mornings I was killing all the sinners of the
land, to wipe out from the city of the Lord all the evildoers” (Psalms 101).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Furthermore, the time at
which this slaughter of enemies was ordered to take place accords very well
with the mystery of this spiritual slaughter, since the twelfth Hebrew month,
which is Adar, can only symbolize the last age of our world when this spiritual
war is being waged above all by the soldiers of Christ. And in the same way,
the thirteenth day symbolizes the faith in the holy Trinity through the
observing the commands of God, which is the basis upon which all our
adversaries are effectively subdued.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Moreover, what follows
next—“And the king’s edict was published in Shushan”— means that the domain of
the heavenly king rules over and governs the entire world: “everything has been
placed under his jurisdiction, and there is no one who can resist his will”
(Esther 13); and our mundane ambitions are laid low by his power. So it makes sense
that according to the text the king’s edict was also published in Shushan,
since “Shushan” means riding or conveying. In the end, the arrogance of the
world is bested by the power of God; which is why the Savior says to his
disciples in the Gospel: “in the world, you will face repression; but take
heart, for I have conquered the world” (John 16).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So Mordecai left the palace
and the sight of the king resplendent in his royal garments, namely in clothing
of blue and bronze, and wearing a golden crown upon his head, and wrapped in a
silken and purple cloak; and the entire city exulted and rejoiced.” It is to
the great credit of our sacred teachers that with their teaching and
encouragement the faithful are able to conquer, through the power of the
supreme king, the savagery of a most wicked enemy; and their reward for this
awaits them in the heavenly kingdom of eternal blessing and perpetual
brightness, which seem to be prefigured by the color blue and the flash of
gold. Moreover, in the celestial citadel the martyrs of Christ, along with
those who are going to rule together with Christ the king, are repaid with the
dignity given to kings by that most righteous of source of recompense, in
exchange for shedding their blood. The terms “purple” and “silken” offer us a
prefiguration of this fact; and every gathering of saints will be happy and
rejoice no less over this in the celestial Jerusalem. This is described in what
follows: “So for the Jews, a new light was seen to arise; and joy, and honor,
and celebration. Among every people, city and province, and wherever the king’s
orders reached, there was a wonderful exultation, banquets, and feasting, and a
holiday; and so much so that many members of other nations and beliefs adopted
their religion and their rites. For a great terror of the Jewish people had
fallen upon them all.” Many, therefore, among the gentiles and enemies of the
Church left behind their idolatry and their gentile superstitions, and were
converted to the Christian faith by the power, wisdom and perseverance of the
holy martyrs, and through the virtue of Christ that shines through them; which
should be perfectly obvious to anyone who reads about the sufferings of the
saints and the triumphs of the martyrs. And since that time, the numbers of the
faithful have been growing every day by the mercy of God, and the precincts of
the Church have been replenished. This is mentioned by the Psalmist: “Let all
the land fear the Lord; let everyone be moved by him, and all who inhabit the
world” (Psalms 33). And likewise: “The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and
will hope in him; and all the upright in heart will be praised” (Psalms 64).
And the apostle says: “In the name of Jesus every creature—celestial,
terrestrial and infernal—shall bend his knee, and every tongue shall proclaim
that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So on the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month, which as we have already said is called Adar, when the
slaughter of all the Jews was being readied and their enemies were eager for
blood, the tables were turned and the Jews began to gain the upper hand, and to
avenge themselves on their opponents. They assembled in each of the cities,
towns and places, to stretch out their hands against their enemies and
persecutors; and no one dared to resist, because the fear of their greatness
had reached all the peoples.” The twelfth month, as we said before, symbolizes
the last era of our world when the Redeemer has been made incarnate and the
preaching of the Gospel itself has spread throughout the entire world. And in
the same way, the thirteenth day declares the light of faith and of good works,
which—as the Gospels predict—is fulfilled every day by the faithful. For in the
twelfth month, “on the thirteenth day of the month, when the slaughter of all
the Jews was being readied and their enemies were eager for blood, the tables
were turned and the Jews began to gain the upper hand, and to avenge themselves
on their opponents.” This means that even though the enemies and persecutors of
the name of Christ are constantly stirring up attacks against the community of
the faithful—which maintains the true expression of the correct faith— and
making every effort to oppress them, the latter have been helped by the grace
of God and strengthened with the shield of faith and the arms of justice so
that they might defeat their adversaries and carry back from them the spoils of
glory. This they do by converting them to the light of faith and making them
partners in the grace of Christ, after repelling their spiritual wickedness and
the disseminators of error who were seducing them through various vices. “And
no one dared to resist them.” That is, the fear of God’s majesty, which in the
Church is made known by the gleam of miracles, thrashes soundly the hearts of
fleshly creatures and compels them to yield to the word of God, which is
naturally described in what follows: </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“For the judges,
commanders and governors of the provinces, and all the dignitaries who presided
over every locale and every activity, were also extolling the Jews out of fear
of Mordecai, because they knew he was in charge of the palace and had a great
deal of power; and the fame of his name was growing greater every day, and was
swiftly appearing on everyone’s lips.” That is, the praiseworthy actions of our
sacred teachers and the power of the virtues gave great honor and reverence to
the mass of the faithful. Hence in the Acts of the Apostles, where we read that
these first preachers of the Gospel were trying to teach and to care for the
word of God, it is written: “For they were devoted to the teachings of the
apostles, and to breaking bread together, and to their prayers. Every soul was
full of awe, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles in
Jerusalem, and there was great fear among them all” (Acts 2). And likewise:
“Many signs and wonders were being performed among the people by the apostles;
and they were all together in the portico of Solomon. But none of the others
dared to join them, though the people were paying them homage” (Acts 5).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“So the Jews struck their
enemies a great blow; and they killed them and treated them as they had
intended to treat the Jews, so much so that even in Shushan they killed five
hundred people in addition to the ten sons of Haman the Agagite, the enemy of
the Jews.” What can it mean when we read that the Jews pursued their enemies
and killed five hundred men in Shushan, except for the ten sons of Haman whom
they nailed to gibbets? Merely that to the people of God, it is not only all
the evildoers among the nations who appear to be loathsome and worthy of
damnation when they persist in their wickedness, refuse to repent for their
sins, and make no effort to obtain forgiveness for their offenses through the
grace of the Holy Spirit; but also the actual Jews of the flesh, i.e. those who
violated the Decalogue of the Law of Moses, and were guilty of the cross of
Christ whom in their faithlessness they took responsibility for at his very
passion, are quite rightly forced to bear the torments of Hell. And none of the
chosen would deign to share in their wickedness, or to imitate their
unspeakable actions; so it makes sense that the text would add that once the
Jews had killed their enemies, they refused to touch or to handle any of the
spoils of their property. "And the total of those who were killed in
Shushan was immediately relayed to the king, who said to the queen: ‘In the
city of Shushan the Jews have killed five hundred men, as well as the ten sons
of Haman; how many do you think they are slaughtering in all of the provinces
taken together? What else do you want, and what would you like me to command?
She answered: ‘If it pleases the king, let the Jews be given the power to do
tomorrow just what they have done today in Shushan; and let the ten sons of
Haman be hanged on gibbets.’ And the king commanded that this be done” etc.
This contention of Queen Esther, in which she fights to have her enemies
aggressively attacked and wiped out, expresses the zeal and ingenuity of the
true queen, that is, of the holy Church which harasses her enemies without
respite and struggles to scatter them completely and subject them to itself. It
is in her voice that the Psalmist speaks: “I will harass my enemies, and I will
encompass them, and I will not turn away until they are ruined; I will afflict
them, and they cannot stand” (Psalms 18). In Shushan she killed first five
hundred men, then three hundred, since she shows that not only those who refuse
to repent their sins, but also those who fail to adorn their faith in the holy
Trinity with good works, are worthy of perpetual death. So it happens that just
as the Jews killed, in the course of two days, seventy-five thousand of their
enemies, so too the faithful strive and attempt to truly defeat and scatter, in
the light of the two Testaments, all those enemies who—because they are devoted
to the five senses of the body, and experience the Law of God in the
flesh—refuse to know it in spirit, complete and perfected by spiritual dogma
through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit. And yet no one wants to touch
any of their property, because the chosen believers would never consent to
sully themselves with the wickedness of the damned; rather, they make
themselves in every way foreign to and separate from the false dogmas, and the
evil deeds, of such people.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And the thirteenth day
of Adar was for them all a day of killing, and on the fourteenth day they
stopped the slaughter. And they established this day as a festival, so that
from then on they would set that occasion aside for banquets, celebration and
feasts. But those who carried out the slaughter in the city of Shushan were
occupied with the slaughter on both the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of
that month; and on the fifteenth day they stopped their attacks, and so they
established that same day as a festival for banqueting and rejoicing. On the
other hand, the Jews who were living in unwalled towns and villages decreed the
fourteenth day of the month of Adar a time of feasting and rejoicing, so that
they exult in it and send one another portions of banquets and food.” Now, the
Scripture tells us that some of the Jews carried out the killing of their
enemies on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and stopped their slaughter
on the fourteenth day when they held this festival; but that others carried out
the killing of their enemies for two days, i.e. the thirteenth and the
fourteenth of the aforementioned month, and finally held a formal rest on the
fifteenth when they left off the slaughter. And this can only mean that some of
the saints, having completed the labors which they carried out in the service
of God by performing it according to the proper doctrine and living it
properly, now have in their hands—even before the time of universal judgment—the
Sabbath rest of eternal peace; while others endure in the flesh until the final
day of resurrection, so that once all their enemies have been bested they will
be suddenly changed through God’s power, and will attain eternal rest and
blessed immortality for both their souls and their bodies. This we know from
the statement that the apostle makes when he writes to the Corinthians: “Behold
the mystery I am telling you: we will all, it is true, rise again, but we will
not all be changed. In a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the final trumpet,
the dead will rise up uncorrupted, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15).
And to the Thessalonians: “For this we say to you in the word of the Lord: we
will not precede those who are sleeping, since the Lord himself—in his command,
and in the voice of the archangel, and in the trumpet of God—will come down
from Heaven. And the dead who are in Christ will rise up first, and then those
of us who are still alive, we who still remain, will be taken up together with those
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord
always” (1 Thessalonians 4).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">After all, the number
fourteen, which contains twice seven, symbolizes the rest of souls from labor
and worry of every kind; and fifteen, which combines the numbers seven and
eight, prefigures the coming rest and the immortality of both souls and bodies;
and so, once the mass of the chosen have completed the labors of the present
life and victory over every enemy has been achieved, they will rejoice in the
kingdom of Heaven in their eternal exultation and their love for one another.
And there will be no end to this joy, because there will no longer be any
further labors to cause us unhappiness. The ingenuity of the sacred preachers
communicates this to their listeners in such a way that it will be believed and
perceived through the true doctrine; hence it then adds:<span>  </span>“So Mordecai wrote all these things, and
recorded them in letters which he sent to the Jews who were living in all the
king’s provinces, both the closer and the more distant ones; that they should
adopt the fourteenth and the fifteenth days of the month of Adar as festivals,
and mark them as regular occasions at the same time every year. Because on
those very days the Jews avenged themselves on their enemies, and grief and
sadness were turned into happiness and joy; and these were days of banqueting
and rejoicing, when they would send one another portions of food and lavish
small gifts upon the poor. And the Jews adopted as a solemn rite everything
they had begun to do at that time, and everything that Mordecai had commanded
them to do in his letters.” For those who always faithfully perform pious
labors, and good works, and who generously give charity, are fighting for this
so that they will be worthy to win entry to eternal life in faith, hope and
charity, in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels and the apostles; and
so that by comforting both themselves—and those who obey them—in the midst of
the troubles of this world, they will gain strength. So by rejoicing in hope
they are patient in times of tribulation, they pray without respite, they give
thanks for everything, and with pious prayers they place their suffering in the
hands of the faithful Lord so that they may be repaid, through his help, with
eternal happiness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“For Haman the son of
Hamedatha of the line of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, intended
evil against them to kill them and wipe them out; and he cast the pur, which
means in our language the lot. And afterwards Esther went in to the king and
begged him to use the royal decree to render void that man’s efforts, and to
turn back upon his head the evil he had intended against the Jews. And finally,
they nailed both him and his sons to a cross. And from then on those days have
been called Purim, that is, Lots, because the pur, i.e. the lot, had been cast
into the urn.” For wicked men often find that their desires are fulfilled in
ways they had not expected to happen; and they are caught in the same traps
they set to ensnare others, as the Scripture shows when it says: “The wicked
are caught in their traps; and whoever digs a pit falls into it” (Proverbs 26).
Hence Haman, who prefigures the enemies of the Church, was likewise forced to
suffer the death he had planned for Mordecai. For the lot cast into an urn
symbolizes the disposition of each and every thing in the mind of man, whose
outcomes depend even so upon the judgment of God. Hence we are told by Solomon:
“Lots are cast in the lap, but they are tempered by the Lord. For his way is
not in the power of man; rather it belongs not to one who wills, or one who
runs, but to God who grants mercy. For all things obey at his nod, and he does
whatever he wishes in Heaven and on earth, on the sea and in all the depths” (Proverbs
16). The Scripture, then, shows how these days of lots should be remembered in
future generations, when it says:<span>  </span>“The
Jews took it upon themselves and their seed, and upon everyone who wanted to
join their faith, to allow no one to let these two days pass without observing
them; this is testified in the Scripture, and the fixed times in every
successive year require it. These are days which will never fall into oblivion,
and in every generation all the provinces throughout the world will celebrate
them. Nor is there any city in which the days of Purim, i.e. of Lots, will not
be observed by the Jews and by their descendants who have been bound to keep
these rites.” So the days of lots—on which God gives his true followers victory
over their enemies—will never fall into oblivion, but will be celebrated
throughout the world in every generation since each of the faithful must
declare, with firm hope, the coming rest of souls and the resurrection of
bodies on the day of judgment; nor should any of the Churches of Christ
throughout the world be bereft of this faith, but should be always mindful of
this most salutary rite and be prepared at every moment, and should make
themselves fit to receive the coming good so that what they celebrate here in
this world they may possess there forever in faith and hope, in the truth of
the thing itself and in eternal happiness. And for the present, while we are
journeying through this life the ingenuity of the teachers, and the Church’s
adherence to the precedent of Esther and Mordecai, ought to accomplish this
along with us through teaching and exhortation, so that we are always devoted
to the celebration and the cultivation of this faith. About this he adds:</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><font size="3"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif">“And Queen Esther the
daughter of Abichail and Mordecai also wrote a second letter so that in the
future, this day would be sanctified with complete devotion. And they sent
messages to all the Jews who were living in the one hundred and twenty-seven
provinces of King Ahasuerus, telling them to have peace and adhere to the
truth, observing the days of lots and celebrating them with joy in their season
just as Mordecai and Esther had decided. And they adopted from them, and from
their seed, the obligation to observe the fasts and the cries, and the days of
lots, and everything that was contained in the account of this book which is
called ‘Esther’.” For we require this admonition so that we will have always in
our hearts the peace of Christianity, and will adopt the truth of the Gospel
itself; which will prevent us from inadvertently falling, through discord and
disagreement, into the errors of the heretics from which there can be no
salvation but certain damnation and ruin. So all those who recognize that,
through the seed of the word of God, they have been reborn in baptism from the
Church and the ministry of the sacred teachers as sons to God the Father, are
certainly required to fast in piety, i.e. to lead a pious, chaste and modest
life; to send up the cries of their prayers and teachings; to celebrate the
days of lots, i.e. of the victory to come, with reverence and firm hope; and to
observe with robust faith and good works everything contained in the book of
the two Testaments.</span><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">“And King Ahasuerus
exacted tribute from every land, and from all the islands of the sea; and his
strength and power, and the honor and exaltation with which he raised up
Mordecai. have been recorded in the books of the Medes and Persians, as well as
how Mordecai of the Jewish race was second to King Ahasuerus, and great among
the Jews, and found favor among the crowd of his brothers. He sought the best
for his people, and whatever he said was concerned with the well-being of his
seed.” Why are we told that King Ahasuerus exacted tribute from every land, and
from all the islands of the sea? Because the historical king of the Persians
and Medes never held every land under his sway, and could not exact tribute
from all the islands of the sea since not even his name could have reached the
aforementioned islands and parts of the world; whereas this statement more
accurately reflects our king and Lord Christ, whose power is in Heaven, and on
earth, and on the sea and in all the depths. In fact, in the Gospels he calls
himself a gateway, since through him we gain the entry to eternal life; and
according to a statement of the Psalmist: “The whole world, all the kings of
the earth, adore him. All the kings of the earth will serve him, the kings of
Tarshish and the islands will offer him gifts, the kings of Arabia and Sheba
will bring presents” (Psalms 72). So the strength, and power, and dignity, and
grandeur of this king, and how he raised up the true Mordecai—that is, the
community of sacred teachers who were leaders of the Church at the head of the
Christian people—are documented in the statements and the writings of not only
the single people of Judea, but of all the nations as well. He has from the
start exalted his chosen ones with the gift of his grace, and has glorified and
honored them in the sight of all the nations; these seek the best for their
people and whatever they say is concerned with the well-being of their seed,
since according to the prophecy of Isaiah: “The watchmen of the Lord will lift
up their voices, and will praise altogether (Isaiah 52); their feet are
beautiful, the feet of those who bring the gospel of peace, the gospel of good
things” (Romans 10). This is because they always ask after the peace of
Jerusalem, and their seed will be known among the nations and their offshoots
amid the peoples. All who have seen them will know them, because they are the
seed which the Lord has blessed. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

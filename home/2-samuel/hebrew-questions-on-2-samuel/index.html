The Hebrew interpreters say that this man was an Amalekite, son of Doeg.
Amalekites and Edomites are all one, since the son of Esau was Eliphaz, father
of Amalec. The crown and bracelets which this man brought to David had been
confided to him, according to the Hebrews, by his father Doeg.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"David," in order to teach, that is, that God teaches the bow to the
sons of Judah, that is, the strength to the kings of Judah, to know that they
were strong, attentive in the fear of the Lord and his precepts, lest the kings
of Judah, out of disobedience, depart from the strength and fear of the Lord,
like Saul, and perish from the same way as him. When it is said, "This is
written in the book of the righteous," this book is that of Samuel, where
are contained the words of the righteous, that is, Samuel, Gad, and Mathan; in
this book it is written how Saul departs from the fear of the Lord, perishes

been regarded as worship done to idols, that is to say, on the heights, as this
passage from Samuel testifies: "Obedience is better than the victims. It
is better to listen than to offer fat of rams, just as the sin of using
divination is an opposition, and the crime of idolatry a defect of consent. "

Saltworks, having cut into pieces eighteen thousand enemies, he found himself
raising a triumphal arch. He still has a name for himself, because after having
conquered the Syrians of Damascus and Syria of Soba, he has taken up, as it
says here, another triumphal arch. If anyone is astonished to find, in most of
the Latin codices, that David cut into pieces, not eighteen, but twelve
thousand enemies in the valley of the salt pans, then he knows that it was an
error of copyist. The truth, let us repeat, is that David in this valley routed
eighteen thousand men. It is Joab who describes twelve thousand, as it is
written at the head of the fifty-eighth Psalm.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

many goods. From Naas he came to the cave of Odolla, where his father and

father and his mother, and all his house. In these words of Achish king of
Geth, "Will this man come into my house?" David departed from there

understood, "from the house of Naas," from which he fled into the
cave of Odoila. But how is it that David came back to him, that is, to Achish,
whose presence he was? It must be understood that the latter Achis was the son
of the man whose presence David had fled. From the fact that, below, we read
that the Achish, who was walking with David in the fight against Saul, was the
son of Maoch. It was not from his father, it was from his mother, called
Maacha, that he took the patronymic name. He did not take his father's name

Hebrew: "Then king David ceased to go after Absalom." It is reported

whenever he saw him, the pain of Amnon's death came back to him, he stopped
going after him; or implies: In order to call him home. As for the passage:
"Because he was consoled for the loss of Amnon," it must be
understood that, after he did not want to continue Absalom, to bring him back
and see him, he began to be comforted by the death of Amnon. Finally, as long
as he thought that Absalom would be brought back and seeing him, the image of
the death of his son Amnon was still in his mind. Otherwise, it is said that he
was consoled by the loss of Amnon, because he had recognized him as vicious and
worthy of the fate which had just struck him.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

he said to his father: "I will go, and I will fulfill the vows I have
vowed to the Lord in Hebron;" he will discover that he has fallen into a

rival the first three</i></font><font size="3">, implying: the virtues of David, wisdom, humility,
and strength, as it was said above </font><b><font size="3">(v.8)</font></b><font size="3">:
</font><i><font size="3">Sitting on his seat and the wisest</font></i><font size="3">;
here is wisdom. </font><i><font size="3">He is like the smallest
worm of wood</font></i><font size="3">; this is humility. </font><i><font size="3">which
killed eight hundred at one brunt</font></i><font size="3">; here is the strength. To these three
virtues did not reach any of David's forts. Hence Eleazar was, it is said,
between the three strong men who accompanied David, because in this fight,
where David killed fourteen of one brunt, Jonathan, the son of Semonaa, on his
side, killed a man who had twenty-four fingers, and the same Eleazar struck the
Philistines until his hand fainted and stiffened with the sword.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

does not read "great works" but "master of works." Cabseel
indeed means "congregation of God." He was the master of the
congregation of God, that is, "Cerethi and Phetti," which translate
to "Who kill and who liveth." <i>He
struck the two lions of Moab</i></font><font size="3">, that is to say, the two strongest men of
Moab. Indeed, when David began the war against these same Moabites, and had three
cords, two to mortify, and the other to vivify, these powerful ones protected
the Moabites. </font><i><font size="3">He struck the two lions of
Moab, and he went down, and struck the lion in the midst of the cistern in the
days of snow</font></i><font size="3">. This lion was Joab. In the middle of the cistern, that is, in
the house of the Lord, where he held the horn of the altar. This house is
called a cistern, because, like the water of the cistern, purifies, so the
mystical cistern, that is to say, the sanctuary of the Lord removes sins. </font><i><font size="3">In the days of the snow</font></i><font size="3">, because he
expiated his sin by death, according to the words of the Psalmist: "You
shall wash me," (Ps. 1) what was done in the middle of the cistern,
"and I shall be whiter than snow,” which is fulfilled in these words: “in
the days of the snow. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Egyptian, a man worthy</span></i></font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">.
This Egyptian was the son of Jera, Semei, who cursed David. We must know that
this Semei was "Bahurim," that is to say "among the chosen
ones." He is described as an Egyptian, because he imitated the conduct of
that Egyptian who blasphemed God, and Moses, at the Lord's command, put to
death in the desert. (Lev 24) One blasphemed God; the other curses the royal
prophet. <i>Worthy of being a spectacle</i></font><font size="3">,
that is, "who deserved death." It was expected, in fact, that he went
out of Jerusalem to put him to death. </font><i><font size="3">Having
in hand a spear</font></i><font size="3">, that is, "the law of the Lord;" if he had
meditated on it, while dwelling at Jerusalem, he was not dead.</font><span><font size="3">  </font></span><font size="3">Because he made vain the order of the king,
going out of Jerusalem, Banaiah came down against him with the rod, that is to
say, in good justice; and the rod he did not hold upright was taken away by
force. </font><i><font size="3">And he slew with his spear</font></i><font size="3">,
because by violating the law, he deserved to be put to death by law, in which
it is written, "You shall not curse gods, and you shall not curse. the
prince of your people. " (Ex. 22:28)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

son of Joiada, said. And he is ranked among the three strong, who were the thirty
most noble.</span></i><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"> The
meaning is that he deserved to be ranked among the three strong, that is,
Abisai, Sibbacha, and Jonathan, to whom he could be equaled for strength.
"These were three out of thirty." It is not surprising, however,
whether the names given make a total of thirty-seven, not thirty. Here is how
it is done. The seven strongest are: David, called Adeodatus, Abisai,
Sibbachai, Jonathan, Eleazar, Semmaa sons of Haggai of Arari, and Banaias.
These are the seven. These are the thirty: Asalel, Eleanan, Semma of Aradi,
Elicha, Elez, Hira, Habierzer, Mobunai, Selmon, Maharai, Eleph, Banaias,
Phratonite, Eldar, Hidah, Albialbon, Azmavet, Eliaba, Semma Arari, Haam,
Elipheleth, Eliam, Ezrai, Phrar, Jigaal, Boni, Selech, Naarai, Hira, Gareb, Uri
the Ethean. And here's why Uriah the Hittite is placed last.</span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

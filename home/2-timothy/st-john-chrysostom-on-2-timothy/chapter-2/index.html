<p><q>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>. And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>. No man that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. The husbandman that labors must be first partaker of the fruits. Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</q></p>
<p>The young sailor at sea is inspired with great confidence, if the Master of the ship has been preserved in a shipwreck. For he will not consider that it is from his inexperience that he is exposed to the storm, but from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of things; and this has no little effect upon his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>. In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> also the Captain, who sees his General wounded and recovered again, is much encouraged. And thus it produces some consolation to the faithful, that the Apostle should have been exposed to great sufferings, and not rendered weak by the utmost of them. And had it not been so, he would not have related his sufferings. For when Timothy heard, that he who possessed so great powers, who had conquered the whole world, is a prisoner, and afflicted, yet is not impatient, nor discontented upon the desertion of his friends; he, if ever exposed to the same sufferings himself, would not consider that it proceeded from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> weakness, nor from the circumstance of his being a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, and inferior to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, since his teacher too suffered the like, but that all this happened from the natural course of things. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself did this, and related what had befallen him, that he might strengthen Timothy, and renew his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a>. And he shows that it was for this reason he mentioned his trials and afflictions, in that he has added, <q>You, therefore, my son, be strong in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>.</q> What do you say? You have shaken us with terrors, you have told us that you are in chains, in afflictions, that all have forsaken you, and, as if you had said you had not suffered anything, nor been abandoned by any, you add. <q>Thou therefore, my son, be strong</q>?— And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> too. For these things were to your strengthening more than to his. For if I, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, endure these things, much more ought thou to bear them. If the master, much more the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. And this exhortation he introduces with much affection, calling him <q>son,</q> and not only so, but <q>my son.</q> If you are a son, he means, imitate your father. If you are a son, be strong in consideration of the things which I have said, or rather be strong, not merely from what I have told you, but <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <q>Be strong,</q> he says, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that is in Christ Jesus</q>; that is, <q>through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> That is, stand firmly. You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the battle. For elsewhere he says, <q>We wrestle not against flesh and blood.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 6:12</font></u></a></span> And this he says not to depress but to excite them. Be sober therefore, he means, and watch, have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Lord coöperating with you, and aiding you in your contest, contribute your own part with much alacrity and resolution. <q>And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men</q>; to <q>faithful</q> men, not to questioners nor to reasoners, to <q>faithful.</q> How faithful? Such as betray not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> they should preach. <q>The things which you have heard,</q> not which you have searched out. For <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:17</font></u></a></span> But wherefore, <q>among many witnesses</q>? As if he had said: You have not heard in secret, nor apart, but in the presence of many, with all openness of speech. Nor does he say, Tell, but <q>commit,</q> as a treasure committed is deposited in safety. Again he alarms his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, both from things above and things below. But he says not only <q>commit to faithful men</q>; for of what advantage is it that one is faithful, if he is not able to convey his doctrine to others? When he does not indeed betray the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; but does not render others faithful? The teacher therefore ought to have two qualities, to be both faithful, and apt to teach; wherefore he says, <q>who shall be able to teach others also.</q></p>
<p><q>Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> Oh, how great a dignity is this, to be a soldier of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>! Observe the kings on earth, how great an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> it is esteemed to serve under them. If therefore the soldier of the king ought to endure hardness, not to endure hardness is not the part of any soldier. So that it behooves you not to complain, if you endure hardness, for that is the part of a soldier; but to complain, if you dost not endure hardness.</p>
<p><q>No man that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.</q></p>
<p>These things are said indeed to Timothy, but through him they are addressed to every teacher and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. Let no one therefore of those who hold the office of a Bishop disdain to hear these things, but let him be ashamed not to do them. <q>If any one strive for masteries,</q> he says, <q>he is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</q> What is meant by <q>lawfully</q>? It is not enough that he enters into the lists, that he is anointed, and even engages, unless he comply with all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of the exercise, with respect to diet, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14481a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temperance</font></u></a> and sobriety, and all the rules of the wrestling school, unless, in short, he go through all that is befitting for a wrestler, he is not crowned. And observe the wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. He mentions wrestlers and soldiers, the one to prepare him for slaughter and blood, the other with reference to endurance, that he might bear everything with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>, and be ever in exercise.</p>
<p><q>The husbandman that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.</q></p>
<p>He had first spoken from his own example as a teacher. He now speaks from those that are more common, as wrestlers and soldiers, and in their case he sets before him the rewards. First, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier; secondly, that he may be crowned; now he proposes a third example that more particularly suits himself. For the instance of the soldier and the wrestler corresponds to those who are under rule, but that of the husbandman to the Teacher. (Strive) not as a soldier or a wrestler only, but as a husbandman too. The husbandman takes care not of himself alone, but of the fruits of the earth. That is, no little reward of his labors is enjoyed by the husbandman.</p>
<p>Here he both shows, that to God nothing is wanting, and that there is a reward for Teaching, which he shows by a common instance. As the husbandman, he says, does not labor without profit, but enjoys before others the fruits of his own toils, so is it fit that the teacher should do: either he means this, or he is speaking of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to be paid to teachers, but this is less consistent. For why does he not say the husbandman simply, but him <q>that labors</q>? Not only that works, but that is worn with toil? And here with reference to the delay of reward, that no one may be impatient, he says, you reap the fruit already, or there is a reward in the labor itself. When therefore he has set before him the examples of soldiers, of wrestlers, and husbandmen, and all figuratively, <q>No one,</q> he says, <q>is crowned except he strive lawfully.</q> And having observed that <q>the husbandman who labors must first be partaker of the fruits,</q> he adds,</p>
<p><q>Consider what I say, and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</q></p>
<p>It is on this account that he has spoken these things in proverb and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. Then again to show his affectionate disposition, he ceases not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for him, as fearing for his own son, and he says,</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. <q>Remember that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, of the seed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04642b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">David</font></u></a>, was raised from the dead, according to my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>. Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even unto bonds.</q></p>
<p>On what account is this mentioned? It is directed chiefly against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>, at the same time to encourage Timothy, by showing the advantage of sufferings, since Christ, our Master, Himself overcame death by suffering. Remember this, he says, and you will have sufficient comfort. <q>Remember that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, of the seed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04642b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">David</font></u></a>, was raised from the dead.</q> For upon that point many had already begun to subvert the dispensation, being ashamed at the immensity of God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. For of such a nature are the benefits which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has conferred upon us, that men were ashamed to ascribe them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and could not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> He had so far condescended. <q>According to my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.</q> Thus he everywhere speaks in his Epistles, saying <q>according to my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>,</q> either because they were bound to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> him, or because there were some who preached <q>another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 1:6</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>Wherein I suffer trouble,</q> he says, <q>as an evil-doer, even unto bonds.</q> Again he introduces consolation and encouragement from himself, and he prepares his hearer's mind with these two things; first, that he should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> him to endure hardness; and, secondly, that he did not so but for a useful purpose, for in this case he will gain, in the other will even suffer harm. For what advantage is it, that you can show that a Teacher has exposed himself to hardship, but not for any useful purpose? But if it is for any benefit, if for the profit of those who are taught, then it is worthy of admiration. </p>
<p><q>But the word of God is not bound.</q> That is, if we were soldiers of this world, and waged an earthly warfare, the chains that confine our hands would avail. But now God has made us such that nothing can subdue us. For our hands are bound, but not our tongue, since nothing can bind the tongue but cowardice and unbelief alone; and where these are not, though you fasten chains upon us, the preaching of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> is not bound. If indeed you bind a husbandman, you prevent his sowing, for he sows with his hand: but if you bind a Teacher, you hinder not the word, for it is sown with his tongue, not with his hand. Our word therefore is not subjected to bonds. For though we are bound, that is free, and runs its course. How? Because though bound, behold, we preach. This is for the encouragement of those that are free. For if we that are bound preach, much more does it behoove you that are loose to do so. You have heard that I suffer these things, as an evil-doer. Be not dejected. For it is a great wonder, that being bound I do the work of those that are free, that being bound I overcome all, that being bound I prevail over those that bound me. For it is the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, not ours. Human chains cannot bind the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. <q>These things I suffer on account of the elect.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 10</font></u></a>. <q>Therefore I endure all things,</q> he says, <q>for the elect's sake, that they may also obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> which is in Christ Jesus with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Behold another incentive. I endure these things, he says, not for myself, but for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of others. It was in my power to have lived free from danger; to have suffered none of these things, if I had consulted my own interest. On what account then do I suffer these things? For the good of others, that others may obtain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life. What then do you promise yourself? He has not said, simply on account of these particular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>; but <q>for the elect's sake.</q> If God has chosen them, it becomes us to suffer everything for their sakes. <q>That they also may obtain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>.</q> By saying, <q>they also,</q> he means, as well as we. For God has chosen us also; and as God suffered for our sakes, so should we suffer for their sakes. Thus it is a matter of retribution, not of favor. On the part of God it was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, for He having received no previous benefit, has done us good: but on our parts it is retribution, we having previously received benefits from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, suffer for these, for whom we suffer, in order <q>that they may obtain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>.</q> What do you say? What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? Are you who wast not the author of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> to yourself, but wast destroying yourself, are you the author of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> to others? Surely not, and therefore he adds, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> that is in Christ Jesus</q>; that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, <q>with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q> Present things are afflictive, but they are but on earth. Present things are ignominious, but they are temporary. They are full of bitterness and pain; but they last only today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Such is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, they are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>, they are in heaven. That is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, this is dishonor.</p>
<p>Moral. For observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, beloved, that is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> which is on earth, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> is in heaven. But if any one would be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, let him be dishonored. If he would obtain rest, let him suffer affliction. If any one would be forever illustrious, would enjoy pleasure, let him despise temporal things. And that dishonor is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> dishonor, let us now set before us to the best of our power, that we may see what is real <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. It is not possible to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> upon earth; if you would be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, it must be through dishonor. And let us prove this in the examples of two <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. The one had the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of this world, the other the dishonor. How? The first was a tyrant, had obtained great success, had raised many trophies, had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> ever flowing in, numerous armies everywhere; he had the greater part of the world and the imperial city subject to his sway, the whole senate crouching to him, and his palace too was advancing with splendid show. When he must be armed, he went forth arrayed in gold and precious stones. When he was to sit still in peace, he sat clothed in robes of purple. He was surrounded by numerous guards and attendants. He was called Lord of land and sea, Emperor, Augustus, Cæsar, King, and other such high-sounding names as implied flattery and courtship; and nothing was wanting that might tend to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. Even wise men and potentates and sovereigns trembled at him. For beside all this, he was said to be a cruel and violent man. He even wished to be thought a god, and he despised both all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, and the very God Who is over all. He was worshipped as a god. What greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> than this? Or rather what greater dishonor? For— I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not how— my tongue is carried away by the force of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, and passes sentence before judgment. Meanwhile let us examine the matter according to the opinion of the multitude, and of unbelievers, and the estimation of flattery.</p>
<p>What is greater in the common estimation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> than to be reputed a god? It is indeed a great disgrace that any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> being should be so mad, but for the present let us consider the matter according to the opinion of the multitude. Nothing then was wanting to him, that contributes to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, but he was worshipped by all as a god. Now in opposition to him, let us consider <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. He was a Cilician, and the difference between Rome and Cilicia, all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. He was a tent-maker, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, unskilled in the wisdom of those without, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> only the Hebrew tongue, a language despised by all, especially by the Italians. For they do not so much despise the barbarian, the Greek, or any other tongue as the Syriac, and this has affinity with the Hebrew. Nor wonder at this, for if they despised the Greek, which is so admirable and beautiful, much more the Hebrew. He was a man that often lived in hunger, often went to bed without food, a man that was naked, and had not clothes to put on; <q>in cold, and nakedness,</q> as he says of himself. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:27</font></u></a></span> Nor was this all; but he was cast into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> at the command of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a> himself, and confined with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>, with grave-breakers, with murderers, and he was, as he himself says, scourged as a malefactor. Who then is the more illustrious? The name of the one the greater part have never heard of. The other is daily celebrated by Greeks, and Barbarians, and Scythians, and those who inhabit the extremities of the earth.</p>
<p>But let us not yet consider what is the case now, but even at that time who was the more illustrious, who the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, he that was in chains, and dragged bound from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, or he that was clothed in a purple robe, and walked forth from a palace? The prisoner certainly. For the other, who had armies at his command, and sat arrayed in purple, was not able to do what he would. But the prisoner, that was like a malefactor, and in mean attire, could do everything with more authority. How? The one said, <q>Do not disseminate the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> The other said, <q>I cannot forbear; 'the word of God is not bound.'</q> Thus the Cilician, the prisoner, the poor tent-maker, who lived in hunger, despised the Roman, rich as he was, and emperor, and ruling over all, who enriched so many thousands; and with all his armies he availed nothing. Who then was illustrious? Who venerable? He that in chains was a conqueror, or he that in a purple robe was conquered? He that standing below, smote, or he that sitting above, was smitten? He that commanded and was despised, or he who was commanded and made no account of the commands? He who being alone was victorious, or he who with numerous armies was defeated? The king therefore so came off, that his prisoner triumphed over him. Tell me then on whose side you would be? For do not look to what comes afterwards, but to what was then their state. Would you be on the side of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a>, or of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>? I speak not according to the estimate of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, for that is manifest; but according to the estimate of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and reverence, and preëminence. Any man of right understanding would say, on the side of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. For if to conquer is more illustrious than to be conquered, he is more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>. And this is not yet much, that he conquered, but that being in so mean a state he conquered one in so exalted a condition. For I say, and will not cease to repeat it, though bound with a chain, yet he smote him that was invested with a diadem.</p>
<p>Such is the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. The chain surpassed the kingly crown, and this apparel was shown more brilliant than that. Clothed in filthy rags, as the inhabitant of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, he turned all eyes upon the chains that hung on him, rather than on the purple robe. He stood on earth bound down and stooping low, and all left the tyrant mounted on a golden chariot to gaze on him. And well they might. For it was customary to see a king with white horses, but it was a strange and unwonted sight to behold a prisoner conversing with a king with as much confidence as a king would converse with a pitiful and wretched slave. The surrounding multitude were all slaves of the king, yet they admired not their lord, but him who was superior to their lord. And he before whom all feared and trembled, was trampled upon by one solitary man. See then how great was the brightness of these very chains!</p>
<p>And what need to mention what followed after these things? The tomb of the one is nowhere to be seen; but the other lies in the royal city itself, in greater splendor than any king, even there where he conquered, where he raised his trophy. If mention is made of the one, it is with reproach, even among his kindred, for he is said to have been profligate. But the memory of the other is everywhere accompanied with a good report, not among us only, but among his enemies. For when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> shines forth, it puts to shame even one's enemies, and if they admire him not for his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, yet they admire him for his boldness and his manly freedom. The one is proclaimed by all mouths, as one that is crowned, the other is loaded with reproaches and accusations. Which then is the real splendor?</p>
<p>And yet I am but praising the lion for his talons, when I ought to be speaking of his real <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>. And what are these? Those in the heavens. How will he come in a shining vesture with the King of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>! How will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a> stand then, mournful and dejected! And if what I say seems to you incredible and ridiculous, you are ridiculous for deriding that which is no subject for laughter. For if you disbelieve the future, be convinced from what is past. The season for being crowned is not yet come, and yet how great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> has the combatant gained! What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> then will he not obtain, when the Distributor of the prizes shall come! He was among foreigners, <q>a stranger and a sojourner</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb011.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 11:13</font></u></a></span>, and thus is he admired: what good will he not enjoy, when he is among his own? Now <q>our life is hid with Christ in God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 3:3</font></u></a></span>; yet he who is dead works more and is more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> than the living. When that our life shall come, what will he not participate? What will he not attain?</p>
<p>On this account God made him enjoy these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>, not because he wanted them. For if when in the body he despised popular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, much more will he despise it now that he is delivered from the body. Nor only on this account has He caused him to enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, but that those who disbelieve the future may be convinced from the present. I say that when the Resurrection shall be, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> will come with the King of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and will enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> blessings. But the unbeliever will not be convinced. Let him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> then from the present. The tent-maker is more illustrious, more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> than the king. No emperor of Rome ever enjoyed so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. The emperor is cast out, and lies, no one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> where. The tent-maker occupies the midst of the city, as if he were a king, and living. From these things <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, even with respect to the future. If he enjoys so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> here, where he was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> and banished, what will he not be when he shall come hereafter? If when he was a tent-maker, he was so illustrious, what will he be when he shall come rivaling the beams of the sun? If in so much meanness he overcame such magnificence, to whom, at his coming, will he not be superior? Can we avoid the conclusion? Who is not moved by the fact, that a tent-maker became more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than the most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> of kings? If here things happen so beyond the course of nature, much more will it be so hereafter. If you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> the future, O man, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> the present. If you will not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> invisible things, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> things that are seen: or rather <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> things which are seen, for so you will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> things which are invisible. But if you will not, we may fitly say with the Apostle, <q>We are pure from your blood</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act020.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 20:26</font></u></a></span>: for we have testified to you of all things, and have left out nothing that we should have said. Blame yourselves therefore, and to yourselves will you impute the punishment of Hell. But let us, my beloved children, be imitators of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, not in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> only, but in his life, that we may attain to heavenly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and trample upon that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that is here. Let not any things present attract us. Let us despise visible things, that we may obtain heavenly things, or rather may through these obtain the others, but let it be our aim preeminently to obtain those, of which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant that we may be all accounted worthy, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 2:11-14</font></u></a></span> </p>
<p><q>It is a faithful saying: for if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him, He also will deny us: if we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not, yet He abides faithful: He cannot deny Himself. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord, that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</q></p>
<p>Many of the weaker sort of men give up the effort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and do not endure the deferring of their hope. They seek things present, and form from these their judgment of the future. When therefore their lot here was death, torments, and chains, and yet he says, they shall come to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life, they would not have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, but would have said, <q>What do you say? When I live, I die; and when I die, I live? You promise nothing on earth, and do you give it in heaven? Little things you do not bestow; and do you offer great things?</q> That none therefore may argue thus, he places beyond <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of these things, laying it down beforehand already, and giving certain signs. For, <q>remember,</q> he says, <q>that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> was raised from the dead</q>; that is, rose again after death. And now showing the same thing he says, <q>It is a faithful saying,</q> that he who has attained a heavenly life, will attain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life also. Whence is it <q>faithful</q>? Because, he says, <q>If we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him.</q> For say, shall we partake with Him in things laborious and painful; and shall we not in things beneficial? But not even a man would act thus, nor, if one had chosen to suffer affliction and death with him, would he refuse to him a share in his rest, if he had attained it. But how are we <q>dead with Him</q>? This death he means both of that in the Laver, and that in sufferings. For he says, <q>Bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co004.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 4:10</font></u></a></span>; and, <q>We are buried with Him by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> into death</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:4</font></u></a></span>; and, <q>Our old man is crucified with Him</q>; and, <q>We have been planted together in the likeness of His death.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:5-6</font></u></a></span> But he also speaks here of death by trials: and that more especially, for he was also suffering trials when he wrote it. And this is what he says, <q>If we have suffered death on His account, shall we not live on His account? This is not to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a>. 'If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him,'</q> not absolutely, we shall reign, but <q>if we suffer,</q> showing that it is not enough to die once, (the blessed man himself died daily,) but there was need of much patient endurance; and especially Timothy had need of it. For tell me not, he says, of your first sufferings, but that you continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Then on the other side he exhorts him, not from the good, but from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> men were to partake of the same things, this would be no consolation. And if having endured they were to reign with Him, but not having endured were not indeed to reign with Him, but were to suffer no worse <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, though this were terrible, yet it would not be enough to affect most men with concern. Wherefore he speaks of something more dreadful still. If we deny Him, He will also deny us. So then there is a retribution not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things only, but of the contrary. And consider what it is probable that he will suffer, who is denied in that kingdom. <q>Whosoever shall deny Me, him will I also deny.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:33</font></u></a></span> And the retribution is not equal, though it seems so expressed. For we who deny Him are men, but He who denies us is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and how great is the distance between <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, it is needless to say.</p>
<p>Besides, we injure ourselves; Him we cannot injure. And to show this, he has added, <q>If we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not, He abides faithful: He cannot deny Himself</q>: that is, if we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> not that He rose again, He is not injured by it. He is faithful and unshaken, whether we say so or not. If then He is not at all injured by our denying Him, it is for nothing else than for our benefit that He desires our confession. For He abides the same, whether we deny Him or not. He cannot deny Himself, that is, His own Being. We may say that He is not; though such is not the fact. It is not in His nature, it is not possible for Him not to be, that is, to go into nonentity. His subsistence always abides, always is. Let us not therefore be so affected, as if we could gratify or could injure Him. But lest any one should think that Timothy needed this advice, he has added,</p>
<p><q>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord, that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</q> It is an overawing thing to call God to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> what we say, for if no one would dare to set at nought the testimony of man when appealed to, much less when the appeal is to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. If any one, for instance, entering into a contract, or making his will, chooses to call witnesses worthy of credit, would any transfer the things to those who are not included? Surely not. And even if he wishes it, yet fearing the credibility of the witnesses, he avoids it. What is <q>charging them before the Lord</q>? He calls God to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> both what was said, and what was done.</p>
<p><q>That they strive not about words to no profit;</q> and not merely so, but <q>to the subverting of the hearers.</q> Not only is there no gain from it, but much harm. <q>Of these things then put them in remembrance,</q> and if they despise you, God will judge them. But why does he admonish them not to strive about words? He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that it is a dainty thing, and that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is ever prone to contend and to dispute about words. To guard against this, he has not only charged them <q>not to strive about words,</q> but to render his discourse more alarming, he adds, <q>to the subverting of the hearers.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 15</font></u></a>. <q>Study to show yourself approved unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Everywhere this <q>not being ashamed</q>! And why is he ever so careful to guard him against shame? Because it was natural for many to be ashamed both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> himself, as being a tent-maker, and of the preaching, since its teachers perished. For Christ had been crucified, himself was about to be beheaded, Peter was crucified with his head downwards, and these things they suffered from audacious and despicable men. Because such men were in power, he says, <q>Be not ashamed</q>; that is, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> not to do anything tending to godliness, though it be necessary to submit to slavery or any other suffering. For how does any one become approved? By being <q>a workman that needs not to be ashamed.</q> As the workman is not ashamed of any work, so neither should he be ashamed who labors in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>. He should submit to anything.</p>
<p><q>Rightly dividing the word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>This he has well said. For many distort it, and pervert it in every way, and many additions are made to it. He has not said directing it, but <q>rightly dividing,</q> that is, cut away what is spurious, with much vehemence assail it, and extirpate it. With the sword of the Spirit cut off from your preaching, as from a thong, whatever is superfluous and foreign to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 16</font></u></a>. <q>And shun profane novelties of speech.</q> </p>
<p>For they will not stop there. For when anything new has been introduced, it is ever producing innovations, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> of him who has once left the safe harbor is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a>, and never stops.</p>
<p><q>For they will increase unto more ungodliness,</q> he says,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 17</font></u></a>. <q>And their word will eat as does a canker.</q></p>
<p>It is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> not to be restrained, not curable by any medicine, it destroys the whole frame. He shows that novelty of doctrine is a disease, and worse than a disease. And here he implies that they are incorrigible, and that they erred not weakly but willfully.</p>
<p><q>Of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus,</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 18</font></u></a>. <q>Who concerning the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of some.</q></p>
<p>He has well said, <q>They will increase unto more ungodliness.</q> For it appears indeed to be a solitary <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, but see what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> spring out of it. For if the Resurrection is already past, not only do we suffer loss in being deprived of that great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, but because judgment is taken away, and retribution also. For if the Resurrection is past, retribution also is past. The good therefore have reaped <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecutions</font></u></a> and afflictions, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> have not been punished, nay verily, they live in great pleasure. It were better to say that there is no resurrection, than that it is already past.</p>
<p><q>And overthrow,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of some.</q></p>
<p><q>Of some,</q> not of all. For if there is no resurrection, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is subverted. Our preaching is vain, nor is Christ risen; and if He is not risen, neither was He born, nor has He ascended into heaven. Observe how this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, while it seems to oppose the doctrine of the Resurrection, draws after it many other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. What then, says one, ought we to do nothing for those who are subverted? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 19</font></u></a>. <q>Nevertheless,</q> he says, <q>the foundation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> stands sure, having this seal, The Lord <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> them that are His. And, Let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</q></p>
<p>He shows that even before they were subverted, they were not firm. For otherwise, they would not have been overthrown at the first attack, as Adam was firm before the commandment. For those who are fixed not only are not harmed through deceivers, but are even admired.</p>
<p>And he calls it <q>sure,</q> and a <q>foundation</q>; so ought we to adhere to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; <q>having this seal, The Lord <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> them that are His.</q> What is this? He has taken it from Deuteronomy; that is, Firm <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> stand fixed and immovable. But whence are they manifest? From having these characters inscribed upon their actions, from their being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and not perishing with the world, and from their departing from iniquity.</p>
<p><q>Let every one,</q> he says, <q>that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</q></p>
<p>These are the distinguishing marks of the foundation. As a foundation is shown to be firm, and as letters are inscribed upon a stone that the letters may be significant. But these letters are shown by works, <q>Having,</q> he says, <q>this seal</q> fixed thereon, <q>Let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</q> Thus if any one is unrighteous, he is not of the foundation. So that this too is of the seal, not to do iniquity.</p>
<p>Moral. Let us not therefore put off from us the royal seal and token, that we may not be of those who are not sealed, that we may not be unsound, that we may be firmly grounded, that we may be of the foundation, and not carried to and fro. This marks them that are of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that they depart from iniquity. For how can any one be of God Who is just, if he does iniquity, if by his works he opposes Him, if he insults Him by his misdeeds? Again we are speaking against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>, and again we have many that are hostile to us. For this affection, like a tyrant, has seized upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of all, and, what is worse, not by necessity nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, but by persuasion and gentle insinuation, and they are grateful for their slavery. And this is indeed the misery; for if they were held by constraint and not by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, they would soon depart. And whence is it, that a thing which is most bitter, appears to be sweet? Whence is it that righteousness, which is a most sweet thing, becomes bitter? It is the fault of our senses. Thus some have thought honey bitter, and have taken with pleasure other things that were noxious. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> is not in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of things, but in the perverseness of the sufferers. The judging faculty of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is disordered. Just as a balance, if its beam be unsteady, moves round, and does not show accurately the weight of things placed in it; so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, if it has not the beam of its own thoughts fixed, and firmly riveted to the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, being carried round and drawn down, will not be able to judge aright of actions.</p>
<p>For if any one will examine carefully, he will perceive the great bitterness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>, not to those who suffer it, but to those who practice it, and to these more than to the others. And let us not speak of things future, but for the present of things here. Hath it not battles, judgments, condemnation, ill will, abuse? What is more bitter than these? Hath it not enmities, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>, and accusations? What is more bitter than these? Hath it not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> continually scourging and gnawing us? If it were possible, I could wish to draw out from the body the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the unrighteous man, and you would see it pale and trembling, ashamed, hiding its head, anxiously fearful, and self-condemned. For should we sink down into the very depths of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, the judging faculty of the mind is not destroyed, but remains unbribed. And no one pursues <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a> thinking it to be good, but he invents excuses, and has recourse to every artifice of words to shift off the accusation. But he cannot get it off his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. Here indeed the speciousness of words, the corruption of rulers, and multitudes of flatterers, is often able to throw <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> into the shade, but within, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> has nothing of this sort, there are no flatterers there, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> to corrupt the judge. For the faculty of judging is naturally implanted in us by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and what comes from God cannot be so corrupted. But uneasy slumbers, thick-coming fancies, and the frequent recollections of guilt, destroy our repose. Has any one, for instance, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjustly</font></u></a> deprived another of his house? Not only is he that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbed</font></u></a> rendered unhappy, but the man who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbed</font></u></a> him. If he is persuaded of a future judgment, (if indeed any one is so persuaded,) he groans exceedingly, and is in misery. But if he believes not in futurity, yet he blushes for shame; or rather there is no man, whether Greek, Jew, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a>, who is not afraid of a judgment to come.</p>
<p>And although he is not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a> with respect to futurity; yet he fears and trembles at what may befall him here, lest he may have some retribution in his property, his children, his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>, or his life. For many such visitations God inflicts. For since the doctrine of the Resurrection is not sufficient to bring all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> to reason, He affords even here many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of His righteous judgment, and exhibits them to the world. One who has gained wrongfully is without children, another falls in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, another is maimed in his body, another loses his son. He considers these things, on these his imagination dwells, and he lives in continual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Know you not what the unrighteous suffer? Is there no bitterness in these things? And were there nothing of this sort, do not all condemn him, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> and abhor him, and think him less rational than a beast, even those who are themselves unrighteous? For if they condemn themselves, much more do they condemn another, calling him rapacious, fraudulent, a pestilent fellow. What pleasure then can he enjoy? He has only the heavier care and anxiety to preserve his gains, and the being more anxious and troubled. For the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> any one gets about him, the more painful watchfulness does he store up for himself. Then what are the curses of those whom he has wronged, their pleadings against him? And what, if sickness should befall him? For it is impossible for one, who has fallen into sickness, however atheistically he may be inclined, not to be anxious about these things, not to be thoughtful, when he is unable to do anything. For as long as we are here, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> enjoying itself, does not tolerate painful thoughts: but when it is about to take its flight from the body, then a greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> constrains it, as entering into the very portals of judgment. Even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, while they are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, live without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but when they are brought to the very curtain of the court, they sink with terror. For when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of death is urgent, like a fire consuming all things besides, it obliges the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to philosophize, and to take thought for futurity. The desire of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of gain, and of bodily pleasures, no longer possesses it. These things passing away like clouds, leave the judging faculty clear, and grief entering in softens the hard heart. For nothing is so opposite to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, as a life of pleasure; nor, on the other hand, is anything so favorable to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> as affliction. Consider what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man will then be. For, <q>an hour of affliction,</q> it is said, <q>makes a man forget much pleasure.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir002.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 2:27</font></u></a></span> What will then be his state, when he considers those whom he has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbed</font></u></a>, and injured, and defrauded, when he sees others reaping the fruits of his grasping, and himself going to pay the penalty? For it cannot, indeed it cannot be, that when fallen into sickness he should not reflect upon these things. For often the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of itself is distracted with agony and terror. What a bitterness is this, tell me! And with every sickness these things must be endured. And what will he not suffer when he sees others punished or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">put to death</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>These things await him here. And as to what he must undergo hereafter, it is not possible to say what punishment, what vengeance, what torments, what racks are reserved for him There. These things we declare. <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk008.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 8:8</font></u></a></span> We are for ever discoursing of these things, not willingly, but of necessity. For we could wish there were no obligation to mention such things at all. But since it must be, we would at least, by a little medicine, deliver you from your disease, and restore you to health. But while you remain in this sickness, it would show a mean and weak spirit, not to say cruelty and inhumanity, to desist from the healing treatment. For if when physicians despair of our bodies, we beseech them not to neglect us, not to cease to our last breath applying whatever is in their power, shall we not much more exhort ourselves? For perhaps when we have come to the very gates of Hell, the vestibule of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> itself, it may be possible to recover, to renew our strength, to lay hold on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life! How many, who have heard ten times and remained insensible, have afterwards at one hearing been converted! Or rather, not at one hearing; for though they seemed insensible at the ten discourses, yet they gained something, and afterwards showed all at once abundant fruit. For as a tree may receive ten strokes, and not fall; then afterwards be brought down all at once by a single blow: yet it is not done by that one blow, but by the ten which made that last successful. And this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to him who sees the root, though he who takes his view of the trunk above <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> it not. So it is in this case. And thus often, when physicians have applied many remedies, no benefit is perceived; but afterwards some one comes in and effects an entire cure. Yet it is not the work of him alone, but of these who have already reduced the disorder. So that, if now we do not bring forth the fruits of hearing the word, yet hereafter we shall. For that we shall bring them forth, I am fully persuaded. For it is not, indeed it is not possible that such eager desire, such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of hearing, should fail of its effect. God forbid! But may we all, having become worthy of the admonitions of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, obtain the everlasting blessings, etc.</p>

<p><q>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and some to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</q></p>
<p>Many men are still even now perplexed to account for the fact, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> are suffered to remain, and are not yet destroyed. Now doubtless various reasons may be assigned for this, as, that they may be converted, or that by their punishment they may be made an example to the multitude. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> here mentions a similar case. For he says,</p>
<p><q>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth.</q> Showing by this, that as in a great house it is likely there should be a great difference of vessels, so here also, in the whole world, for he speaks not of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> only, but of the world at large. For think not, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, that he means it of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>; for there he would not have any vessels of wood or of earth, but all of gold or silver where is the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, where is that <q>pure virgin, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:27</font></u></a></span> And this is what he means to say: Let it not disturb you that there are corrupt and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> men. For in a great house there are such vessels. But what then? They do not receive the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. But some are to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and some to dishonor. <q>Nay,</q> says one, <q>in a house they may be of some use, but not at all in the world.</q> Though God employs them not for such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> service, he makes use of them for other purposes. For instance, the vainglorious man builds much, so does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man, the merchant, the tradesman, the magistrate; there are certain works in the world suited to these. But the golden vessel is not of such a nature. It is employed about the royal table. He does not say however that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> is a necessary thing, (for how should it be?) but that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> also have their work. For if all were of gold or of silver, there would be no need of the viler sort. For instance, if all were hardy, there would be no need of houses; if all were free from luxury, there would be no need of dainties. If all were careful only for necessaries, there would be no need of splendid building.</p>
<p><q>If therefore a man purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, sanctified.</q> Do you see that it is not of nature, nor of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of matter, to be a vessel of gold or of earth, but of our own choice? For otherwise the earthen could not become gold, nor could the golden descend to the vileness of the other. But in this case there is much change, and alteration of state. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was an earthen vessel, and became a golden one. Judas was a golden vessel, and became an earthen one. The earthen vessels, therefore, are such from uncleanness. The fornicator and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man become earthen vessels. <q>But how then does he say elsewhere, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels,' so that he does not despise but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> the earthen vessel, speaking of it as the recipient of the treasure?</q> There he shows the nature itself, and not the form of the material. For he means to say that our body is an earthen vessel. For as earthenware is nothing else but baked clay, so is our body nothing but clay consolidated by the heat of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; for that it is earthen, is evident. For as such a vessel is often by falling broken and dashed to pieces, so our body falls and is dissolved by death. For how do our bones differs from a potsherd, hard and dry as they are? Or our flesh from clay, being, like it, composed of water? But, as I said, how is it that he does not speak contemptuously of it? Because there he is discoursing of its nature, here of our choice. <q>If a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>purge himself from these,</q> not merely <q>cleanse,</q> but <q>cleanse out,</q> that is, cleanse himself perfectly, <q>he shall be a vessel unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use.</q> The others therefore are useless for any good purpose, though some use is made of them. <q>And prepared unto every good work.</q> Even though he do it not, he is fit for it, and has a capacity for it. We ought therefore to be prepared for everything, even for death, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrdom</font></u></a>, for a life of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virginity</font></u></a>, or for all these.</p>

<p>Not only the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> of fornication, but every inordinate desire is a youthful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. Let the aged learn that they ought not to do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of the youthful. If one be given to insolence, or a lover of power, of riches, of bodily pleasures, it is a youthful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, and foolish. These things must proceed from a heart not yet established, from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> not deeply grounded, but in a wavering state. What then does he advise in order that none may be captivated by these things? <q>Flee youthful</q> imaginations, but</p>
<p><q>Follow righteousness, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</q></p>
<p>He calls <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> in general, <q>righteousness</q>: godliness of life, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, meekness, charity.</q></p>
<p>What is meant by <q>those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart</q>? It is as if he said, Rejoice not in those who only call upon the Lord; but those who call upon Him sincerely and unfeignedly, who have nothing of deceit about them, who approach Him in peace, who are not contentious. With these associate yourself. But with others be not easy, but only as far as lies in you, be peaceable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 23</font></u></a>. <q>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that they do gender strifes.</q></p>
<p>Do you see how he everywhere draws him off from questions; not that he was not able to overthrow them; for he was well able. For had he not been able he would have said, Be diligent, that you may be able to refute them; as when he says, <q>Give attendance to reading, for by so doing you shall both save yourself and them that hear you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:13-16</font></u></a></span> But he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> that it was useless to enter at all into these disputes, that there will be no end of it, save contentions, enmities, insults, and reproaches. These <q>questions</q> therefore <q>avoid</q>; so that there are other questions, some relating to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, some to other things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 24</font></u></a>. <q>And the servant of the Lord must not strive.</q></p>
<p>Not even in questions ought he to strive, for the servant of the Lord must keep far from strife, since God is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of peace, and what should the servant of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of peace have to do with strife?</p>
<p><q>But be gentle unto all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>How is it then he says, <q>Rebuke with all authority</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 2:15</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>Let no man despise your youth</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:12</font></u></a></span>: and again, <q>Rebuke them sharply</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 1:13</font></u></a></span> Because this is consistent with meekness. For a strong rebuke, if it be given with gentleness, is most likely to wound deeply: for it is possible, indeed it is, to touch more effectually by gentleness, than one overawes by boldness.</p>
<p><q>Apt to teach</q>; that is, those who are willing to be taught. For <q>a man that is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>after the first and second admonition reject.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit003.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 3:10</font></u></a></span> <q>Patient.</q> He has well added this, for it is a quality which a teacher above all things ought to possess. All things are vain without it. And if fishermen do not despair, though often they cast their nets for a whole day without catching anything, much more should not we. For see what is the result. From constant teaching, it often happens that the plow of the word, descending to the depth of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, roots out the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> passion that troubled it. For he that hears often will at length be affected. A man cannot go on hearing continually without some effect being produced. Sometimes therefore, when he was on the point of being persuaded, he is lost by our becoming weary. For the same thing occurs, as if an unskillful husbandman should in the first year dig about the vine he had planted, and seeking to reap some fruit in the second year, and again in the third, and gathering nothing, should after three years despair, and in the fourth year, when he was about to receive the recompense of his labors, abandon his vine. And having said, <q>Patient,</q> he is not satisfied, but goes on to say,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 25</font></u></a>. <q>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.</q></p>
<p>For he that teaches must be especially careful to do it with meekness. For a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that wishes to learn cannot gain any useful instruction from harshness and contention. For when it would apply, being thus thrown into perplexity, it will learn nothing. He who would gain any useful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> ought above all things to be well disposed towards his teacher, and if this be not previously attained, nothing that is requisite or useful can be accomplished. And no one can be well disposed towards him who is violent and overbearing. How is it then that he says, <q>A man that is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretic</font></u></a>, after the first and second admonition, reject</q>? He speaks there of one incorrigible, of one whom he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> to be diseased beyond the possibility of cure.</p>
<p><q>If God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti002.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 26</font></u></a>. <q>And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What he says amounts to this. Perhaps there will be a reformation. Perhaps! For it is uncertain. So that we ought to withdraw only from those, of whom we can show plainly, and concerning whom we are fully persuaded, that whatever be done, they will not be reformed. <q>In meekness,</q> he says. In this temper, you see, we ought to address ourselves to those who are willing to learn, and never cease from conversing with them till we have come to the demonstration. </p>
<p><q>Who are taken captive by him at his will.</q> It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> said, <q>Who are taken captive,</q> for meanwhile they float in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>. Observe here how he teaches to be humble-minded. He has not said, if perhaps you should be able, but, <q>if perhaps God should grant them a recovery</q>; if anything be done, therefore, all is of the Lord. Thou plantest, you water but He sows and makes it produce fruit. Let us not therefore be so affected, as if we ourselves wrought the persuasion, even if we should persuade any one. <q>Taken captive by him,</q> he says, <q>to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q> This no one will say relates to doctrine, but to life. For <q>His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a></q> is that we live rightly. But some are in the snare of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> by reason of their life, we ought not therefore to be weary even with respect to these.</p>
<p><q>If perhaps,</q> he says, <q>they may recover, that are taken captive, unto His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q> Now <q>If perhaps,</q> implies much longsuffering. For not to do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is a snare of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>For as a sparrow, though it be not wholly enclosed, but only caught by the foot, is still under the power of him who set the snare; so though we be not wholly subverted, both in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and life, but in life only, we are under the power of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.

And in many places we find men not blamed for their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, but punished for their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> life only; as elsewhere, not reproved for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> lives, but perishing for their pravity of doctrine. For these things hold together. You see that when we do not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, we are under the snare of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. And often not only from a bad life, but from one defect, we enter into Hell, where there are not good qualities to counterbalance it, since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a> were not accused of fornication or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a>, nor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> or ill-will, nor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>, nor of unsound <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, but of a failure of oil, that is, they failed in almsgiving, for that is the oil meant. And those who were pronounced accursed in the words, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">everlasting fire</font></u></a>,</q> were not accused of any such crimes, but because they had not fed Christ.</p>
<p>Moral. Do you see that a failure in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">almsgiving</font></u></a> is enough to cast a man into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> fire? For where will he avail who does not give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>? Do you fast every day? So also did those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a>, but it availed them nothing. Do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>? What of that? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">almsgiving</font></u></a> is unfruitful, without that all things are unclean and unprofitable.

Tell me, therefore, do you observe <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03637d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">chastity</font></u></a>? On what account? From <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of punishment? By no means. It is of a natural endowment that you observe it, since if you were chaste from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of punishment, and did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> to nature in submitting to so severe a rule, much more ought thou to do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. For to govern the desire of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and of bodily pleasures, is not the same thing. The latter is much more difficult to restrain. And wherefore? Because the pleasure is natural, and the desire of it is innate and of natural growth in the body. It is not so with riches. Herein we are able to resemble <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, in showing mercy and pity. When therefore we have not this quality, we are devoid of all good.

But what? <q>Be merciful, as your Father in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> is merciful.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk006.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 6:36</font></u></a></span> This is the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.

He says: <q>I will have mercy, and not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/hos006.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hosea 6:6</font></u></a></span> God made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and earth, and sea. Great works these, and worthy of His wisdom! But by none of these has He so powerfully attracted <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> to Himself, as by mercy and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. For that indeed is the work of power and wisdom and goodness. But it is far more so that He became a servant. Do we not for this more especially admire Him? Are we not for this still more amazed at Him? Nothing attracts God to us so much as mercy. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> from beginning to end discourse upon this subject. But I speak not of mercy that is accompanied with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. That is not mercy. For it is not the root of the thorn but of the olive that produces the oil ; so it is not the root of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, of iniquity, or of rapine, that produces mercy. Do not put a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14035b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slander</font></u></a> on almsgiving. Do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> it to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> spoken of by all. If you commit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a> for this, that you may give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, nothing is more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> than your almsgiving. For when it is produced by rapine, it is not almsgiving, it is inhumanity, it is cruelty, it is an insult to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. If Cain so offended, by offering inferior gifts of his own, shall he not offend, who offers the goods of another? An offering is nothing else but a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, a purification, not a pollution. And thou who darest not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with unclean hands, do you offer the dirt and filth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a>, and think you do nothing wrong? Thou sufferest not your hands to be full of dirt and filth, but having first cleansed these, you offer. Yet that filth is no charge against you, while the other deserves reproach and blame. Let it not therefore be our consideration, how we may offer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and oblations with clean hands, but how the things offered may be pure. If one, after having washed a vessel clean, should fill it with unclean gifts, would it not be ridiculous mockery? Let the hands be clean; and they will be so, if we wash them not with water only, but first with righteousness. This is the purifier of the hands. But if they be full of unrighteousness, though they be washed a thousand times, it avails nothing. <q>Wash you, make you clean</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:16</font></u></a></span>, He says, but does He add, <q>Go to the baths, the lakes, the rivers</q>? No; but what? <q>Put away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of your doings from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>.</q> This is to be clean. This it is to be cleansed from defilement. This is real purity. The other is of little use; but this bestows upon us confidence towards God. The one may be obtained by adulterers, thieves, murderers, by worthless, and dissolute, and effeminate <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, and especially the latter. For they are ever careful of the cleanliness of their bodies, and scented with perfumes, cleansing their sepulcher. For their body is but a sepulcher, since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is dead within it. This cleanness therefore may be theirs, but not that which is inward.</p>
<p>To wash the body is no great matter. That is a Jewish purification, senseless and unprofitable, where purity within is wanting. Suppose one to labor under a putrefying sore, or consuming ulcer; let him wash his body ever so much, it is of no advantage. And if the putrefaction of the body receives no benefit from cleansing and disguising the outward appearance; when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is infected with rottenness, what is gained by the purity of the body? Nothing! Our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> ought to be pure, and pure they cannot be, if they are sent forth from a corrupt <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and nothing so corrupts the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a> and rapine. But there are some who after committing numberless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> during the day, wash themselves in the evening and enter the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">churches</font></u></a>, holding up their hands with much confidence, as if by the washing of the bath they had put off all their guilt. And if this were the case, it would be a vast advantage to use the bath daily! I would not myself cease to frequent the baths, if it made us pure, and cleansed us from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>! But these things are trifling and ridiculous, the toys of children. It is not the filth of the body, but the impurity of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, to which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is averse. For He says, <q>Blessed are the pure</q>— does He say in body? No— <q>in heart: for they shall see God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:8</font></u></a></span> And what says the Prophet: <q>Create in me a clean heart, O God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa050.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 51:10</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Wash my heart from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 4:14</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>It is of great use to be in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of doing good actions. See how trifling and unprofitable these washings are. But when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is prepossessed by a habit, it does not depart from it, nor does it venture to draw near in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, till it has fulfilled these ceremonies. For instance, we have brought ourselves to a habit of washing and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">praying</font></u></a>, and without washing we do not think it right to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>. And we do not willingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with unwashed hands, as if we should offend <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and violate our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. Now if this trifling custom has so great power over us, and is observed every day; if we had brought ourselves to a habit of almsgiving, and had determined so constantly to observe it, as never to enter a house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> with empty hands, the point would be gained. For great is the power of habit both in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and when this carries us on, there will be little trouble. Many are in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of crossing themselves continually, and they need no one to remind them of it, but often when the mind is wandering after other things, the hand is involuntarily drawn by custom, as by some living teacher, to make the sign. Some have brought themselves into a habit of not swearing at all, and therefore neither willingly nor unwillingly do they ever do it. Let us then bring ourselves into such a habit of almsgiving.</p>
<p>What labors were it worth to us to discover such a remedy. For say, were there not the relief of almsgiving, while we still by our numberless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> rendered ourselves liable to Divine vengeance, should we not have lamented sadly? Should we not have said, O that it were possible by our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> to wash away our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and we would have parted with it all! O that by our riches we could put away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, then we would not spare our substance? For if we do this in sickness, and at the point of death we say, <q>If it were possible to buy off death, such an one would give all his possessions</q>; much more in this matter. For see how great is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of God for man. He has granted us power to buy off not temporal but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> death. Do not purchase, He says, this short life, but that life that is everlasting. It is that I sell you, not the other: I do not mock you. Did you gain the present life, you had gained nothing. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the worth of that which I offer you. The bargainers and traffickers in worldly goods do not act thus. They, when they can impose on whom they will, give a little to receive a great deal. It is not so with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He gives the greater by far for the less.</p>
<p>Tell me, if you were to go to a merchant, and he were to set before you two stones, one of little worth, and the other very precious, and sure to fetch a large amount of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>; if he allowed you for the price of the cheap one to carry off the more costly, should you complain of him? No! You would rather admire his liberality. So now, two lives are set before us, the one temporal, the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a>. These God offers us for sale, but He would sell us the latter rather than the former. Why do we complain, like silly children, that we receive the more precious? Is it possible then to purchase life for money? Yes, when what we bestow is our own, and not the property of another; when we do not practice an imposture. But, you say, henceforth the goods are mine. They are not yours after rapine. They are still your neighbor's, though thou were a thousand times the master of them. For if you should receive a deposit, it would not be your own even for the short season that the depositor was traveling, though it might be laid up with you. If therefore that is not ours, which we received with the consent and thanks of those who deposited it, even for the short period that we retain it, much less is that ours, which we plundered against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of its owner. He is the master of it, however long you may withhold it. But Virtue is really our own; as for money, even our own is not strictly ours, much less that of others. Today it is ours, tomorrow it belongs to another. What is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> is our own possession. This does not suffer loss, like other things, but is entirely possessed by all who have it. This therefore let us acquire, and let us despise riches, that we may be able to attain those real goods, of which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant that we may be thought worthy to partake, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness, etc.</p>

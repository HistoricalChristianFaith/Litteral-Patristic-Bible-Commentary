<div>2 Timothy 1:1, 2 
<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Jesus Christ, to Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</q></p>
<p>What is the reason of his writing this second Epistle to Timothy? He had said, <q>I hope to come unto you shortly</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti003.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 3:14</font></u></a></span>, and as this had not taken place, instead of coming to him, he consoles him by a letter, when he was grieving perhaps for his absence, and oppressed by the cares of the government, which he had now taken in hand. For even great men, when they are placed at the helm, and are charged with the direction of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, feel the strangeness of their position, and are overwhelmed, as it were, by the waves of business. This was particularly the case when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> was first preached, when the ground was everywhere unturned, and all was opposition and hostility. There were, besides, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresies</font></u></a> commencing from the Jewish teachers, as he has shown in his former Epistle. Nor does he only comfort him by letters, he invites him to come to him: <q>Do your diligence,</q> he says, <q>to come shortly unto me,</q> and, <q>when you come, bring with you the books, but especially the parchments.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:9-13</font></u></a></span> And he seems to have written this Epistle when his end was approaching. For he says, <q>I am now ready to be offered up</q>; and again, <q>At my first answer no man stood with me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 4:6-16</font></u></a></span> To set all this right, he both offers consolation from his own trials, and also says,</p>
<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, an apostle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, according to the promise of life which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Thus at the very commencement he raises up his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>. Tell me not, he says, of the dangers here. These obtain for us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life, where there is no peril, where grief and mourning flee away. For He has not made us Apostles only that we might encounter dangers, but that we might even suffer and die. And as it would not be a consolation to recount to him his own troubles, but rather an increase of his grief, he begins immediately with offering comfort, saying, <q>According to the promise of life which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> But if it is a <q>promise,</q> seek it not here. For, <q>hope that is seen is not hope.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:24</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2</font></u></a>. <q>To Timothy, my dearly beloved son.</q></p>
<p>Not merely his <q>son,</q> but, <q>dearly beloved</q>; since it is possible for sons not to be beloved. Not such, he means, are you; I call you not merely a son, but a <q>dearly beloved son.</q> As he calls the Galatians his children, but at the same time complains of them; <q>My little children,</q> he says, <q>of whom I travail in birth again.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal004.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 4:19</font></u></a></span> And he bears particular testimony to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> by calling him <q>beloved.</q> For where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> does not arise from nature, it must arise from the merit of the object. Those who are born of us, are loved not only on account of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but from the force of nature; but when those who are of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> are beloved, it is on account of nothing but their merit, for what else can it be? And this especially in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, who never acted from partiality. And further, he shows by calling him his <q>beloved son,</q> that it was not because he was offended with him, or despised him, or condemned him; that he did not come to him.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2</font></u></a>. <q>Grace, mercy, and peace, from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>These things which he before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> for, he again invokes upon him. And observe how, at the very beginning, he excuses himself for not having come to him, nor seen him. For his words, <q>Till I come,</q> and, <q>Hoping to come to you shortly,</q> had led Timothy to expect his coming soon. For this he excuses himself, but he does not immediately mention the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his not coming, lest he should grieve him mightily. For he was detained in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> by the emperor. But when at the end of the Epistle he invited him to come to him, then he informed him of it. He does not at the outset plunge him into sorrow, but encourages the hope that he shall see him. <q>Greatly desiring to see you,</q> and <q>Do your diligence to come unto me shortly.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 1:4</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti004.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">4:9</font></u></a></span> Immediately therefore he raises him up, and proceeds to praise him.</p>
<p>Ver. 3, 4. <q>I thank <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> night and day; greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I might be filled with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q>'I thank <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,' he says, 'that I remember you,' so much do I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> you.</q> This is a mark of excessive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, when a man glories in his affection from loving so much. <q>I thank <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>Whom I serve</q>: and how? <q>With a pure <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>,</q> for he had not violated his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. And here he speaks of his blameless life, for he everywhere calls his life his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. Or because I never gave up any good that I purposed, for any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, not even when I was a persecutor. Wherefore he says, <q>I obtained mercy, because I did it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorantly</font></u></a> in unbelief</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 1:13</font></u></a></span>; all but saying, <q>Do not suspect that it was done of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>.</q> He properly commends his own disposition, that his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> may appear sincere. For what he says is in fact, <q>I am not false, I do not think one thing and profess another.</q> So in the book of Acts we read he was compelled to praise himself. For when they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14035b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slandered</font></u></a> him as a seditious man and an innovator, he said in his own defense, <q>Ananias said to me, The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of His mouth. For you shall be His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> unto all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> of what you have seen and heard.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act022.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 22:14-15</font></u></a></span> In the same manner here, that he may not, as if he had been forgetful, have the character of one void of friendship and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> praises himself, saying, that <q>without ceasing I have remembrance of you,</q> and not simply that, but <q>in my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>.</q> That is, it is the business of my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, that which I constantly continue to perform. For this he shows by saying, <q>For this I besought God day and night, desiring to see you.</q> Mark his fervent desire, the intensity of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. And again, his humility, how he apologizes to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and then he shows that it was not on light or vain grounds; and this he had shown us before, but again gives <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of it. <q>Being mindful of your tears.</q> It was natural for Timothy, when parting from him, to mourn and weep, more than a child torn away from the milk and from the breast of its mother. <q>That I may be filled with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>; greatly desiring to see you.</q> I would not willingly have deprived myself of so great a pleasure, though I had been of an unfeeling and brutal nature, for those tears coming to my remembrance would have been enough to soften me. But such is not my character. I am one of those who serve God purely; so that many strong motives urged me to come to you. So then he wept. And he mentions another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, and that of a consolatory kind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 5</font></u></a>. <q>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> that is in you.</q></p>
<p>This is another commendation, that Timothy came not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, nor of unbelievers, but of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a> that served Christ from the first. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:1-3</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>Which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice.</q></p>
<p>For Timothy, it says, <q>was the son of a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> which was a Jewess, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> How a Jewess? How believing? Because she was not of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, <q>but on account of his father, who was a Greek, and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> that were in those quarters, he took and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> him.</q> Thus, as these mixtures of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> took place, the Law began gradually to be dissolved. And mark in how many ways he shows that he did not despise him. <q>I serve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>I have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a></q> for my part, and you have your <q>tears,</q> and not your tears only, but for <q>your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>,</q> because you are a laborer for the Truth, because there is no deceit in you. As therefore you show yourself worthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, being so affectionate, so genuine a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> of Christ; and as I am not one of those who are devoid of affection, but of those who earnestly pursue the Truth; what hindered me from coming to you?</p>
<p><q>And I am persuaded that in you also.</q></p>
<p>From the beginning, he means, you have had this excellency. You received from your forefathers the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> unfeigned. For the praises of our ancestors, when we share in them, redound also to us. Otherwise they avail nothing, but rather condemn us; wherefore he has said, <q>I am persuaded that in you also.</q> It is not a conjecture, he means, it is my persuasion; I am fully assured of it. If therefore from no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> motive you have embraced it, nothing will be able to shake your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 6</font></u></a>. <q>Wherefore I put you in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.</q></p>
<p>You see how greatly dispirited and dejected he considers him to be. He almost says, <q>Think not that I despise you, but be assured that I do not condemn you, nor have I forgotten you. Consider, at any rate, your mother and your grandmother. It is because I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that you have unfeigned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> that I put you in remembrance.</q> For it requires much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> to stir up the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. As fire requires fuel, so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> requires our alacrity, that it may be ever fervent. <q>I put you in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that is in you by the putting on of my hands,</q> that is, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, which you have received, for presiding over the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, for the working of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, and for every service. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> it is in our power to kindle or to extinguish; wherefore he elsewhere says, <q>Quench not the Spirit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th005.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 5:19</font></u></a></span> For by sloth and carelessness it is quenched, and by watchfulness and diligence it is kept alive. For it is in you indeed, but do thou render it more vehement, that is, fill it with confidence, with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> and delight. Stand manfully.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 7</font></u></a>. <q>For God has not given us the spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but of power, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and of a sound mind.</q></p>
<p>That is, we did not receive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, that we should shrink from exertion, but that we may speak with boldness. For to many He gives a spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, as we read in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> of the Kings. <q>A spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> fell upon them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo015.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 15:16</font></u></a>?</span> That is, he infused terror into them. But to you He has given, on the contrary, a spirit of power, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> toward Himself. This, then, is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, and yet not merely of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, but when we have first performed our own parts. For the Spirit that makes us cry, <q>Abba, Father,</q> inspires us with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> both towards Him, and towards our neighbor, that we may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> one another. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> arises from power, and from not fearing. For nothing is so apt to dissolve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and a suspicion of treachery.</p>
<p><q>For God has not given us the spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but of power, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and of a sound mind</q>: he calls a healthy state of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> a sound <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, or it may mean sobriety of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, or else a sobering of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, that we may be sober-minded, and that if any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> befall us, it may sober us, and cut off superfluities.</p>
<p>Moral. Let us then not be distressed at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> that happen to us. This is sobriety of mind. <q>In the season of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>make not haste.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir002.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 2:2</font></u></a></span> Many have their several griefs at home, and we share in each other's sorrows, though not in their sources. For one is unhappy on account of his wife, another on account of his child, or his domestic, another of his friend, another of his enemy, another of his neighbor, another from some loss. And various are the causes of sorrow, so that we can find no one free from trouble and unhappiness of some kind or other, but some have greater sorrows and some less. Let us not therefore be impatient, nor think ourselves only to be unhappy.</p>
<p>For there is no such thing in this mortal life as being exempt from sorrow. If not today, yet tomorrow; if not tomorrow, yet some later day trouble comes. For as one cannot sail, I mean, over a long sea, and not feel disquietude, so it is not possible to pass through this life, without experience of sorrow, yea though you name a rich man; for in that he is rich, he has many occasions of inordinate desires, yea, though the king himself, since he too is ruled by many, and cannot do all that he would. Many favors he grants contrary to his wishes, and more than all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> to do what he would not. How so? Because he has many about him who wish to receive his gifts. And just think how great is his chagrin, when he is desirous to effect something, but is unable, either from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> or suspicion, or hindered by enemies or by friends. Often when he has succeeded in achieving some end, he loses all the pleasure of it, from many becoming at enmity with him. Again, do you think that they are free from grief, who live a life of ease? It is impossible. As a man cannot escape death, so neither can he escape sorrow. How many troubles must they endure, which we cannot express in words, and which they only can <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> by experience! How many have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> a thousand times to die, in the midst of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and luxury! For luxury by no means puts men out of the reach of grief: it is rather the very thing to produce sorrows, diseases, and uneasiness, often when there is no real ground for it. For when such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, it is apt to grieve even without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>. Physicians say that from a weak state of the stomach arise sorrows without any occasion; and does not the like happen to ourselves, to feel uneasy, without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> for it? In short, we can find no one who is exempted from sorrow. And if he has less occasion for grief than ourselves, yet he thinks otherwise, for he feels his own sorrows, more than those of other men. As they who suffer pain in any part of their bodies, think that their sufferings exceed their neighbor's. He that has a disease of the eye, thinks there is nothing so painful, and he that has a disorder in the stomach, considers that the sorest of diseases, and each thinks that the heaviest of sufferings, with which he is himself afflicted. So it is with sorrow, each thinks his own present grief the most severe. For of this he judges by his own experience. He that is childless considers nothing so sad as to be without children; he that is poor, and has many children, complains of the extreme <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> of a large <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>. He who has but one, looks upon this as the greatest misery, because that one, being set too much store by, and never corrected, becomes willful, and brings grief upon his father. He who has a beautiful wife, thinks nothing so bad as having a beautiful wife, because it is the occasion of jealousy and intrigue. He who has an ugly one, thinks nothing worse than having a plain wife, because it is constantly disagreeable. The private man thinks nothing more mean, more useless, than his mode of life. The soldier declares that nothing is more toilsome, more perilous, than warfare; that it would he better to live on bread and water than endure such hardships. He that is in power thinks there can be no greater burden than to attend to the necessities of others. He that is subject to that power, thinks nothing more servile than living at the beck of others. The married man considers nothing worse than a wife, and the cares of marriage. The unmarried declares there is nothing so wretched as being unmarried, and wanting the repose of a home. The merchant thinks the husbandman <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> in his security. The husbandman thinks the merchant so in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. In short, all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> are somehow hard to please, and discontented and impatient. When condemning the whole race, he says, <q>Man is a thing of nought</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa143.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 144:4</font></u></a></span>, implying that the whole kind is a wretched unhappy creature. How many long for old age! How many think youth a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> time! Thus each different period has its unhappiness. When we find ourselves censured on account of our youth, we say, why are we not old? And when our heads are hoary, we ask whither has our youth flown? Numberless, in short, are the occasions of sorrow. There is one path only by which this unevenness can be escaped. It is the path of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Yet that too has its sorrows, only they are sorrows not unprofitable, but productive of gain and advantage. For if any one has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, he washes away his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> by the compunction that comes of his sorrow. Or, if he has grieved in sympathizing with a fallen brother, this is not without its recompense. For sympathy with those that are in misery gives us great confidence towards God.</p>
<p>Hear therefore what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> is taught by the example of Job in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> Scripture! Hear also what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says: <q>Weep with them that weep</q>; and again, <q>Condescend to men of low estate.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom012.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 12:15-16</font></u></a></span> For, by the communication of sorrow, the extreme burden of it is lightened. For as in the case of a heavy load, he that bears part of the weight relieves him who was bearing it alone, so it is in all other things.</p>
<p>But now, when any one of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">relatives</font></u></a> dies, there are many who sit by and console us. Nay, we often raise up even an ass that has fallen; but when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of our brethren are falling, we overlook them and pass by, as if they were of less value than an ass. And if we see any one entering into a tavern indecently; nay, if we see him drunk, or guilty of any other unseemly action, we do not restrain him, we rather join him in it. Whence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> has said: <q>They not only do these things, but have pleasure in them that do them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:32</font></u></a></span> The greater part even form associations for the purposes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>. But do thou, O man, form associations to restrain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> of inebriety. Such friendly doings are beneficial to those who are in bonds or in affliction. Something of this kind <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> enjoined to the Corinthians, alluding to which he says, <q>That there be no gatherings when I come.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co016.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 16:2</font></u></a></span> But now everything is done with a view to luxury, reveling, and pleasure. We have a common seat, a common table, we have wine in common, and common expenses, but we have no community of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. Such were the friendly doings in the time of the Apostles; they brought all their goods into the common stock. Now I do not require you to bestow all, but some part. <q>Let each lay by him in store on the first day of the week, as God has prospered him,</q> and lay it down as a tribute for the seven days. In this way give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, whether more or less. <q>For you shall not appear before the Lord empty.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo023.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 23:15</font></u></a></span> This was said to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, how much more then to us. For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the poor stand before the doors, that no one may enter empty, but each may do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> at his entrance. You enter to implore mercy. First show mercy. He that comes later owes the more. For when we have been first, he that is second pays down more. Make God your debtor, and then offer your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>. Lend to Him, and then ask a return, and you shall receive it with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15235c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">usury</font></u></a>. God wills this, and does not retract. If you ask with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, He holds himself <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a>. If you ask with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, you lend and receive interest. Yes, I beseech you! It is not for stretching out your hands you shall be heard! stretch forth your hands, not to heaven, but to the poor. If you stretch forth your hand to the hands of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, you have reached the very summit of heaven. For He who sits there receives your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. But if you lift them up without a gift, you gain nothing. If the king, arrayed in purple, should come to you and ask an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, would you not readily give all that you have? But now when you are entreated through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, not by an earthly but a heavenly King, do you stand regardless, and defer your gift? What punishment then do you not deserve? For the being heard depends not upon the lifting up of your hands, nor on the multitude of your words, but upon your works. For hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, <q>When you</q> spread <q>forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yea, when you make many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, I will not hear.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:15</font></u></a></span> For he ought to be silent, who needs mercy, and not even to look up to heaven; he that has confidence may say much. But what says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>, <q>Judge for the fatherless, plead for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow</font></u></a>, learn to do good.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:17</font></u></a></span> In this way we shall be heard, though we lift not up our hands, nor utter a word, nor make request. In these things then let us be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a>, that we may obtain the promised blessings, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness, etc.</p>

<p><q>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> according to the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; Who has saved us, and called us with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>There is nothing worse than that man should measure and judge of divine things by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> reasonings. For thus he will fall from that rock a vast distance, and be deprived of the light. For if he who wishes with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> eyes to apprehend the rays of the sun will not only not apprehend them, but, besides this failure, will sustain great injury; so, but in a higher degree, is he in a way to suffer this, and abusing the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, who would by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> reasonings gaze intently on that Light. Observe accordingly how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09645c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Marcion</font></u></a>, and Manes, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15256a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Valentinus</font></u></a>, and others who introduced their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresies</font></u></a> and pernicious doctrines into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church of God</font></u></a>, measuring divine things by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> reasonings, became ashamed of the Divine economy. Yet it was not a subject for shame, but rather for glorying; I speak of the Cross of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. For there is not so great a sign of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of God for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>, not heaven, nor sea, nor earth, nor the creation of all things out of nothing, nor all else beside, as the Cross. Hence it is the boast of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> forbid that I should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, save in the Cross of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:14</font></u></a></span> But natural men, and those who attribute to God no more than to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> beings, stumble, and become ashamed. Wherefore <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> from the first exhorts his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, and through him all others, in these words: <q>Be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,</q> that is, <q>Be not ashamed, that you preach One that was crucified, but rather <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> in it.</q> For in themselves death and imprisonment and chains are matters of shame and reproach. But when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> is added before us, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> viewed aright, they will appear full of dignity, and matter for boasting. For it was that death which saved the world, when it was perishing. That death connected earth with heaven, that death destroyed the power of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and made men <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, and sons of God: that death raised our nature to the kingly throne. Those chains were the conversion of many. <q>Be not</q> therefore <q>ashamed,</q> he says, <q>of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a></q>; that is, though you should suffer the same things, be not thou ashamed. For that this is implied appears from what he said above; <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has given us a spirit of power, and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and of a sound mind</q>; and by what follows, <q>Be thou partaker of the sufferings of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a></q>: not merely be not ashamed of them, but be not ashamed even to experience them.</p>
<p>And he does not say, <q>Do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>,</q> but, the more to encourage him, <q>be not ashamed,</q> as if there were no further danger, if he could overcome the shame. For shame is only then oppressive, when one is overcome by it. Be not therefore ashamed, if I, who raised the dead, who wrought <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, who traversed the world, am now a prisoner. For I am imprisoned, not as a malefactor, but for the sake of Him who was crucified. If my Lord was not ashamed of the Cross, neither am I of chains. And with great propriety, when he exhorts him not to be ashamed, he reminds him of the Cross. If you are not ashamed of the Cross, he means, neither be thou of chains; if our Lord and Master endured the Cross, much more should we chains. For he who is ashamed of what He endured, is ashamed of Him that was crucified. Now it is not on my own account that I bear these chains; therefore do not give way to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> feelings, but bear your part in these sufferings. <q>Be partaker of the afflictions of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>.</q> He says not this, as if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> could suffer injury, but to excite his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> to suffer for it.</p>
<p><q>According to the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; Who has saved us, and called us with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.</q></p>
<p>More especially because it was a hard thing to say, <q>Be partakers of afflictions,</q> he again consoles him. Reckon that you sustain these things, not by your own power, but by the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For it is your part to choose and to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a>, but God's to alleviate sufferings and bid them cease. He then shows him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of His power. Consider how you were saved, how you were called. As he elsewhere says, <q>According to His power that works in us.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph003.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 3:20</font></u></a></span> So much was it a greater exercise of power to persuade the world to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, than to make the Heavens. But how was he <q>called with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> calling</q>? This means, He made them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, who were sinners and enemies. <q>And this not of ourselves, it was the gift of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> If then He is mighty in calling us, and good, in that He has done it of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and not of debt, we ought not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.

<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 11</font></u></a>. <q>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an Apostle, and a teacher of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Why does he so constantly repeat this, and call himself a teacher of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>? Because he wishes to persuade them that they also ought to draw close to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>. Be not therefore dismayed at my sufferings. The sinews of death are unstrung. It is not as a malefactor that I suffer, but because I am <q>a teacher of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> At the same time he makes his discourse worthy of credit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 12</font></u></a>. <q>For the which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> I also suffer these things, nevertheless I am not ashamed. For I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Whom I have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.</q></p>
<p><q>I am not ashamed,</q> he says. For are chains, are sufferings, a matter for shame? Be not then ashamed! You see how he illustrates his teaching by his works. <q>These things,</q> he says, <q>I suffer</q>: I am cast into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, I am banished; <q>For I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Whom I have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him against That Day.</q> What is <q>that which is committed</q>? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, the preaching of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>. He, who committed this to him, he says, will preserve it unimpaired. I suffer everything, that I may not be despoiled of this treasure, and I am not ashamed at these things, so long as it is preserved uninjured. Or he calls the Faithful the charge which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> committed to him, or which he committed to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For he says, <q>Now I commit you to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act020.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 20:32</font></u></a></span> That is, these things will not be unprofitable to me. And in Timothy is seen the fruit of the charge thus <q>committed.</q> You see that he is insensible to sufferings, from the hope that he entertains of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Moral. Such ought a Teacher to be, so to regard his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, to think them everything. <q>Now we live,</q> he says, <q>if you stand fast in the Lord.</q> And again, <q>What is our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hope</font></u></a>, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 3:8</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2:19</font></u></a></span> You see his anxiety in this matter, his regard for the good of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, not less than for his own. For teachers ought to surpass natural <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a>, to be more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a> than they. And it becomes their children to be kindly affectioned towards them. For he says, <q>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> as they that must give account.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb013.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 13:17</font></u></a></span> For say, is he subject to so dangerous a responsibility, and are you not willing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> him, and that too, for your own benefit? For though his own state should be good, yet as long as you are in a bad condition his anxiety continues, he has a double account to render. And consider what it is to be responsible and anxious for each of those who are under his rule. What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> would you have reckoned equal, what service, in requital of such dangers? You can not offer an equivalent. For you have not yet devoted your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> for him, but he lays down his life for you, and if he lays it not down here, when the occasion requires it, he loses it There. But you are not willing to submit even in words. This is the prime <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of all these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, that the authority of rulers is neglected, that there is no reverence, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. He says, <q>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves.</q> But now all is turned upside down and confounded. And this I say not for the sake of the rulers; (for what benefit will they have of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> they receive from us, except so far as we are rendered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a>;) but I say it for your advantage. For with respect to the future, they will not be benefited by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> done them, but receive the greater condemnation, neither will they be injured as to the future by ill treatment, but will have the more excuse. But all this I desire to be done for your own sakes. For when rulers are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> by their people, this too is reckoned against them; as in the case of Eli it is said, <q>Did I not choose him out of his father's house?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa002.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 2:27</font></u></a></span> But when they are insulted, as in the instance of Samuel, God said, <q>They have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa008.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 8:7</font></u></a></span> Therefore insult is their gain, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> their burden. What I say, therefore, is for your sakes, not for theirs. He that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> the Priest, will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> God also; and he who has learned to despise the Priest, will in process of time insult God. <q>He that receives you,</q> He says, <q>receives Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:40</font></u></a></span> <q>Hold my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir007.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 7:31</font></u></a>?</span>, He says. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> learned to despise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, because they despised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, and would have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him. For when a man is piously disposed towards the Priest, he is much more so towards God. And even if the Priest be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, God seeing that you respect him, though unworthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, through reverence to Him, will Himself reward you. For if <q>he that receives a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> in the name of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> shall receive a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet's</font></u></a> reward</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:41</font></u></a></span>; then he who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> and submits and gives way to the Priest shall certainly be rewarded. For if in the case of hospitality, when you know not the guest, you receive so high a recompense, much more will you be requited, if you obey him whom He requires you to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>. <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scribes</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisees</font></u></a>,</q> He says, <q>sit in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses'</font></u></a> seat; all therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, but do not do after their works.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:2-3</font></u></a></span> Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what the Priest is? He is an Angel of the Lord. Are they his own words that he speaks? If you despise him, you despise not him, but God that ordained him. But how does it appear, you ask, that he is ordained of God? Nay, if you suppose it otherwise, your hope is rendered vain. For if God works nothing through his means, thou neither hast any Laver, nor art partaker of the Mysteries, nor of the benefit of Blessings; you are therefore not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>. What then, you say, does God ordain all, even the unworthy? God indeed does not ordain all, but He works through all, though they be themselves unworthy, that the people may be saved. For if He spoke, for the sake of the people, by an ass, and by Balaam, a most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> man, much more will He speak by the mouth of the Priest. What indeed will not God do or say for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? By whom does He not act? For if He wrought through Judas and those other that <q>prophesied,</q> to whom He will say, <q>I never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:22-23</font></u></a></span>; and if others <q>cast out devils</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 6:8</font></u></a></span>; will He not much more work through the Priests? Since if we were to make inquisition into the lives of our rulers, we should then become the ordainers of our own teachers, and all would be confusion; the feet would be uppermost, the head below. Hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying, <q>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> judgment.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:3</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Why do you judge your brother?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom014.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 14:10</font></u></a></span> For if we may not judge our brother, much less our teacher. If God commands this indeed, you do well, and sinnest if you do it not; but if the contrary, dare not do it, nor attempt to go beyond the lines that are marked out. After <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01003a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Aaron</font></u></a> had made the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06628b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">golden calf</font></u></a>, Corah, Dathan, and Abiram raised an insurrection against him. And did they not perish? Let each attend to his own department. For if he teach perverted doctrine, though he be an Angel, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> him not; but if he teach the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, take heed not to his life, but to his words. You have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> to instruct you in what is right both by words and works. But you say, <q>He gives not to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, he does not govern well.</q> Whence do you know this? Blame not, before you are informed. Be afraid of the great account. Many judgments are formed upon mere opinion. Imitate your Lord, who said, <q>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, and if not, I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen018.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 18:21</font></u></a></span> But if you have enquired, and informed yourself, and seen; yet await the Judge, and usurp not the office of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. To Him it belongs, and not to you, to make this inquisition. You are an inferior servant, not a master. You are a sheep, be not curious concerning the shepherd, lest you have to give account of your accusations against him. But you say, How does he teach me that which he does not practice himself? It is not he that speaks to you. If it be he whom you obey, you have no reward. It is Christ that thus admonishes you. And what do I say? You ought not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, if he speaks of himself, or anything <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a>, but the Apostle, that has Christ speaking in him. Let not us judge one another's conduct, but each his own. Examine your own life.</p>
<p>But you say, <q>He ought to be better than I.</q> Wherefore? <q>Because he is a Priest.</q> And is he not superior to you in his labors, his dangers, his anxious conflicts and troubles? But if he is not better, ought thou therefore to destroy yourself? These are the words of arrogance. For how is he not better than yourself? He steals, you say, and commits sacrilege! How do you know this? Why do you cast yourself down a precipice? If you should hear it said that such an one has a purple robe, though you knew it to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, and couldest convict him, you decline to do it, and pretend <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, not being willing to run into unnecessary danger. But in this case you are so far from being backward, that even without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> you expose yourself to the danger. Nor think you are not responsible for these words. Hear what Christ says, <q>Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:36</font></u></a></span> And do you think yourself better than another, and do you not groan, and beat your breast, and bow down your head, and imitate the Publican?</p>
<p>And then you destroy yourself, though thou be better. Be silent, that you cease not to be better. If you speak of it, you have done away the merit; if you think it, I do not say so; if you dost not think it, you have added much. For if a notorious sinner, when he confessed, <q>went home justified,</q> he who is a sinner in a less degree, and is conscious of it, how will he not be rewarded? Examine your own life. Thou dost not steal; but you are rapacious, and overbearing, and guilty of many other such things. I say not this to defend theft; God forbid! Deeply lament if there is any one really guilty of it, but I do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> it. How great an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is sacrilege, it is impossible to say. But I spare you. For I would not that our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> should be rendered vain by accusing others. What was worse than the Publican? For it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> that he was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>, and guilty of many offenses, yet because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisee</font></u></a> only said, <q>I am not as this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>,</q> he destroyed all his merit. I am not, you say, like this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrilegious</font></u></a> Priest. And dost not thou make all in vain?</p>
<p>This I am compelled to say, and to enlarge upon in my discourse, not so much because I am concerned for them, but because I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> for you, lest you should render your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> vain by this boasting of yourselves, and condemnation of others. For hear the exhortation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, <q>Let every one prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:4</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>If you had a wound, tell me, and should go to a physician, would you stay him from salving and dressing your own wound, and be curious to enquire whether the physician had a wound, or not? And if he had, would you mind it? Or because he had it, would you forbear dressing your own, and say, A physician ought to be in sound health, and since he is not so, I shall let my wound go uncured? For will it be any palliation for him that is under rule, that his Priest is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>? By no means. He will suffer the destined punishment, and you too will meet with that which is your due. For the Teacher now only fills a place. For <q>it is written, They shall all be taught of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh006.htm#verse45" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 6:45</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa054.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 54:13</font></u></a></span> <q>Neither shall they say, Know the Lord. For all shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Me from the least to the greatest.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer031.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 31:34</font></u></a></span> Why then, you will say, does he preside? Why is he set over us? I beseech you, let us not speak ill of our teachers, nor call them to so strict an account, lest we bring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> upon ourselves. Let us examine ourselves, and we shall not speak ill of others. Let us reverence that day, on which he enlightened us. He who has a father, whatever faults he has, conceals them all. For it is said, <q>Glory not in the dishonor of your father; for your father's dishonor is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> unto you. And if his understanding fail, have patience with him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir003.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 3:10-12</font></u></a></span> And if this be said of our natural fathers, much more of our spiritual fathers. Reverence him, in that he every day ministers to you, causes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> to be read, sets the house in order for you, watches for you, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a> for you, stands imploring God on your behalf, offers supplications for you, for you is all his worship. Reverence all this, think of this, and approach him with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pious</font></u></a> respect. Say not, he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>. What of that? He that is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, does he of himself bestow upon you these great benefits? By no means. Everything works according to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Not even the righteous man can benefit you, if you are unfaithful, nor the unrighteous harm you, if you are faithful. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when He would save His people, wrought for the ark by Oxen. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 6:12</font></u></a></span> Is it the good life or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of the Priest that confers so much on you? The gifts which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> bestows are not such as to be effects of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of the Priest. All is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. His part is but to open his mouth, while God works all: the Priest only performs a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a>. Consider how wide was the distance between John and Jesus. Hear John saying, <q>I have need to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> by You</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:14</font></u></a></span>, and, <q>Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh001.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 1:27</font></u></a></span> Yet notwithstanding this difference, the Spirit descended. Which John had not. For <q>of His fullness,</q> it is said, <q>we all have received.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh001.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 1:16</font></u></a></span> Yet nevertheless, It descended not till He was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>. But neither was it John who caused It to descend. Why then is this done? That you may learn that the Priest performs a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a>. No man differs so widely from another man, as John from Jesus, and yet with him the Spirit descended, that we may learn, that it is God who works all, that all is God's doing. I am about to say what may appear strange, but be not astonished nor startled at it. The Offering is the same, whether a common man, or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> or Peter offer it. It is the same which Christ gave to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and which the Priests now minister. This is nowise inferior to that, because it is not men that sanctify even this, but the Same who sanctified the one sanctifies the other also. For as the words which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> spoke are the same which the Priest now utters, so is the Offering the same, and the Baptism, that which He gave. Thus the whole is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. The Spirit immediately fell upon Cornelius, because he had previously fulfilled his part, and contributed his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. And this is His Body, as well as that. And he who thinks the one inferior to the other, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not that Christ even now is present, even now operates. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> therefore these things, which we have not said without reason, but that we may conform your minds in what is right, and render you more secure for the future, keep carefully in mind what has been spoken. For if we are always hearers, and never doers, we shall reap no advantage from what is said. Let us therefore attend diligently to the things spoken. Let us imprint them upon our minds. Let us have them ever engraved upon our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">consciences</font></u></a>, and let us continually ascribe <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>. That good thing which was committed unto you keep by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> Which dwells in us. This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but, when he was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rome</font></u></a>, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you know very well.</q></p>
<p>Not by letters alone did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> instruct his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> in his duty, but before by words also which he shows, both in many other passages, as where he says, <q>whether by word or our Epistle</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2th002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Thessalonians 2:15</font></u></a></span>, and especially here. Let us not therefore suppose that anything relating to doctrine was spoken imperfectly. For many things he delivered to him without writing. Of these therefore he reminds him, when he says, <q>Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me.</q> After the manner of artists, I have impressed on you the image of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, fixing in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> a sort of rule, and model, and outline of all things pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. These things then hold fast, and whether you are meditating any matter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, or of a sound <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, form from hence your ideas of them. It will not be necessary to have recourse to others for examples, when all has been deposited within yourself.</p>
<p><q>That good thing which was committed unto you keep,</q>— how?— <q>by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> which dwells in us.</q> For it is not in the power of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, when instructed with things so great, to be sufficient for the keeping of them. And why? Because there are many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, and thick darkness, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> still at hand to plot against us; and we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what is the hour, what the occasion for him to set upon us. How then, he means, shall we be sufficient for the keeping of them? <q>By the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a></q>; that is if we have the Spirit with us, if we do not expel <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, He will stand by us. For, <q>Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa126.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 127:1</font></u></a></span> This is our wall, this our castle, this our refuge. If therefore It dwells in us, and is Itself our guard, what need of the commandment? That we may hold It fast, may keep It, and not banish It by our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil deeds</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Then he describes his trials and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, not to depress his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, but to elevate him, that if he should ever fall into the same, he may not think it strange, when he looks back and remembers what things happened to his Teacher. What then says he? Since it was probable that Timothy might be apprehended, and be deserted, and be relieved by no friendly attention, or influence, or assistance, but be abandoned even by his friends and the faithful themselves, hear what he says, <q>This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me.</q> It seems that there were then in Rome many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> from the regions of Asia. <q>But no one stood by me,</q> he says, no one acknowledged me, all were alienated. And observe the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. He only mentions their conduct, he does not curse them, but he praises him that showed kindness to him, and invokes a thousand blessings upon him, without any curse on them. <q>Of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes. The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain. But, when he was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rome</font></u></a>, he sought me out diligently and found me.</q> Observe how he everywhere speaks of the shame, and not of the danger, lest Timothy should be alarmed. And yet it was a thing that was full of peril. For he gave offense to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nero</font></u></a> by making friends with one of his prisoners. But when he was in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Rome</font></u></a>, he says, he not only did not shun intercourse with me, but <q>sought me out very diligently, and found me.</q></p>
<p><q>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you know very well.</q></p>
<p>Such ought the faithful to be. Neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, nor threats, nor disgrace, should deter them from assisting one another, standing by them and succoring them as in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>. For they do not so much benefit those who are in danger, as themselves, by the service they render to them, making themselves partakers of the crowns due to them. For example, is any one of those who are devoted to God visited with affliction and distress, and maintaining the conflict with great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fortitude</font></u></a>; while you are not yet brought to this conflict? It is in your power if you will, without entering into the course, to be a sharer of the crowns reserved for him, by standing by him, preparing his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and animating and exciting him. Hence it is that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> elsewhere says, <q>You have done well that you did communicate with my affliction. For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 4:14-16</font></u></a></span> And how could they that were far off share in the affliction of him that was not with them? How? He says, <q>you sent once and again unto my necessities.</q> Again he says, speaking of Epaphroditus, <q>Because he was near unto death, not regarding his life, that he might supply your lack of service toward me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi002.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 2:30</font></u></a></span> For as in the service of kings, not only those who fight the battle, but those who guard the baggage, share in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; and not merely so, but frequently even have an equal portion of the spoils, though they have not imbrued their hands in blood, nor stood in array, nor even seen the ranks of the enemy; so it is in these conflicts. For he who relieves the combatant, when wasted with hunger, who stands by him, encouraging him by words, and rendering him every service, he is not inferior to the combatant.</p>
<p>For do not suppose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> the combatant, that irresistible and invincible one, but some one of the many, who, if he had not received much consolation and encouragement, would not perhaps have stood, would not have contended. So those who are out of the contest may perchance be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of victory to him, who is engaged in it, and may be partakers of the crowns reserved for the victor. And what wonder, if he who communicates to the living is thought worthy of the same rewards with those who contend, since it is possible to communicate after death even with the departed, with those who are asleep, who are already crowned, who want for nothing. For hear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> saying, <q>Partaking in the memories of the Saints.</q> And how may this be done? When you admire a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, when you do any of those acts for which he was crowned, you are evidently a sharer in his labors, and in his crowns.</p>
<p><q>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</q> He had compassion on me, he says, he shall therefore have the like return in that terrible Day, when we shall have need of much mercy. <q>The Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord.</q> Are there two Lords then? By no means. But <q>to us there is one Lord Christ Jesus, and one God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co008.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 8:6</font></u></a></span> Here those who are infected with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heresy</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09645c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Marcion</font></u></a> assail this expression; but let them learn that this mode of speech is not uncommon in Scripture; as when it is said, <q>The Lord said unto my Lord</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa109.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 110:1</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>I said unto the Lord, You are my Lord</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa015.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 16:2</font></u></a></span>; and, <q>The Lord rained fire from the Lord.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen019.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 19:24</font></u></a></span> This indicates that the Persons are of the same substance, not that there is a distinction of nature. For we are not to understand that there are two substances differing from each other, but two Persons, each being of the same substance.</p>
<p>Observe too, that he says, <q>The Lord grant him mercy.</q> For as he himself had obtained mercy from Onesiphorus, so he wished him to obtain the same from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Moral. And if Onesiphorus, who exposed himself to danger, is saved by mercy, much more are we also saved by the same.

He is called a God <q>of mercies and a God of comfort</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 1:3</font></u></a></span>; good as none else is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, and kind, and gentle, and full of pity, Who <q>wills not the death of a sinner, but that he should be converted and live.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze018.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 18:24</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze033.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">33:11</font></u></a></span> Whence then, whence is that Day so full of agony and anguish? A stream of fire is rolling before His face. The books of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> are opened. The day itself is burning as an oven, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> are flying around, and many furnaces are prepared. How then is He good and merciful, and full of lovingkindness to man? Even herein is He merciful, and He shows in these things the greatness of His lovingkindness. For He holds forth to us these terrors, that being constrained by them, we may be awakened to the desire of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And observe how, besides commending Onesiphorus, he specifies his kindness, <q>he oft refreshed me</q>; like a wearied wrestler overcome by heat, he refreshed and strengthened him in his tribulations. And in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well. Not only at Ephesus, but here also he refreshed me. For such ought to be the conduct of one on the watch and awakened to good actions, not to work once, or twice, or thrice, but through the whole of life. For as our body is not fed once for all, and so provided with sustenance for a whole life, but needs also daily food, so in this too, godliness requires to be supported every day by good works. For we ourselves have need of great mercy. It is on account of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the Friend of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, does all these things, not that He needs them Himself, but He does all for us. For therefore it is that He has revealed them all, and made them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to us, and not merely told us of them, but given us assurance of them by what He has done. Though He was worthy of credit upon His word only, that no one may think it is said hyperbolically, or in the way of threatening merely, we have further assurance by His works. How? By the punishments which He has inflicted both publicly and privately. And that you may learn by the very examples, at one time he punished <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>, at another time He brought a flood of water upon the earth, and that utter destruction, and again at another time a flood of fire: and even now we see in many instances the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> suffering vengeance, and punishments, which things are figures of Hell.</p>
<p>For lest we should slumber and be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a>, and forget His word, He awakens our minds by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>; showing us, even here, courts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>, judgment seats, and trials. Is there then among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> so great a regard for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>, and does <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, whose ordinance even these things are, make no account of it? Is this credible? In a house, in a market-place, there is a court of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>. The master daily sits in judgment upon his slaves, calls them to account for their offenses, punishes some and pardons others. In the country, the husbandman and his wife are daily at law. In a ship, the master is judge, and in a camp the general over his soldiers, and everywhere one may see judicial proceedings. In trades, the master judges the learner. In short all, publicly and privately, are judges to one another. In nothing is the consideration of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> overlooked, and all in every place give account of their actions. And is the inquisition for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> here thus spread through cities, through houses, and among individuals; and is there no regard for what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> there, where <q>the right hand of God is full of righteousness</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa047.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 48:10</font></u></a></span>, and <q>His righteousness is as the mountains of God</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa035.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 36:6</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>How is it then that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>the righteous Judge, strong and patient</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa007.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 7:11</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13722a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Septuagint</font></u></a></span>, bears thus with men, and does not exact punishment? Here you have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, He is longsuffering, and thereby would lead you to repentance. But if you continue in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, thou <q>after your hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto yourself <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom002.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 2:5</font></u></a></span> If then He is just, He repays according to desert, and does not overlook those who suffer wrongfully, but avenges them. For this is the part of one who is just. If He is powerful, He requites after death, and at the Resurrection: for this belongs to him who is powerful. And if because He is longsuffering He bears with men, let us not be disturbed, nor ask, why He does not prosecute vengeance here? For if this were done, the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human race</font></u></a> before this would have been swept away, if every day He should call us to account for our transgressions, since there is not, there is not indeed, a single day pure from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, but in something greater or less we offend; so that we should not one of us have arrived at our twentieth year, but for His great long-suffering, and His goodness, that grants us a longer space for repentance, that we may put off our past transgressions.</p>
<p>Let each therefore, with an upright <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, entering into a review of what he has done, and bringing his whole life before him, consider, whether he is not deserving of chastisements and punishments without number? And when he is indignant that some one, who has been guilty of many bad actions, escapes with impunity; let him consider his own faults, and his indignation will cease. For those crimes appear great, because they are in great and notorious matters; but if he will enquire into his own, he will perhaps find them more numerous. For to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rob</font></u></a> and to defraud is the same thing, whether it be done for gold or silver; since both proceed from the same mind. He that will steal a little would not refuse to steal much, if it fell in his way; and that it does not, is not his own choice, but an accidental circumstance. A poor man, who robs a poorer, would not hesitate to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rob</font></u></a> the rich if he could. His forbearance arises from weakness, and not from choice. Such an one, you say, is a ruler; and takes away the property of those who are under his rule. And say, dost not thou steal? For tell me not that he steals talents, and you as many pence. In giving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, some cast in gold, while the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widow</font></u></a> threw in two mites, yet she contributed not less than they. Wherefore? Because the intention is considered, and not the amount of the gift. And then, in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, you will have God judge thus, and wouldest, because of your poverty, receive no less a reward for giving two mites than he who lays down many talents of gold? And is not the same rule applicable to wrongful dealings? How is this consistent? As she who contributed two mites was considered equal to the greatest givers, because of her good intention, so thou, who stealest two mites, art as culpable as those mightier <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>. Nay, if I may give utterance to something strange, you are a worse robber than they. For a man would be equally an adulterer, whether he committed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> with the wife of a king, or of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, or of a slave: since the offense is not judged by the quality of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, but by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> of his will who commits it; so is it likewise in this case. Nay, I should call him who committed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> with an inferior perhaps more guilty, than him who intrigued with the queen herself. For in this case, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and beauty, and other attractions might be pleaded, none of which exist in the other. Therefore the other is the worse adulterer. Again, he seems to me a more determined drunkard, who commits that excess with bad wine; so he is a worse defrauder, who does not despise small thefts; for he who commits great robberies, would perhaps not stoop to petty thefts, whereas he who steals little things would never forbear greater, therefore he is the greater thief of the two. For how should he despise gold, who does not despise silver? So that when we accuse our rulers, let us recount our own faults, and we shall find ourselves more given to wrong and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a> than they; unless we judge of right and wrong rather by the act, than by the intention of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, as we ought to judge. If one should be convicted of having stolen the goods of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a> man, another those of a rich man, will they not both be punished alike? Is not a man equally a murderer, whether he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> a poor and deformed, or a rich and handsome, man? When therefore we say that such an one has seized upon another person's land, let us reflect upon our own faults, and then we shall not condemn other men, but we shall admire the longsuffering of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. We shall not be indignant that judgment does not fall upon them, but we shall be more slow to commit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> ourselves. For when we perceive ourselves liable to the same punishment, we shall no longer feel such discontent, and shall desist from offenses, and shall obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to whom with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, etc.</p>

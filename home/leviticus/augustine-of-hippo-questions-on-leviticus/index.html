5,1).</strong> If a person sins and hears the voice of the oath and she is a witness, or
sees it, or knows it, if she does not declare it and is burdened with sin, that
is, if she does not declare it, she is burdened with sin. The addition of
"and" is a habitual way of expressing oneself from Scripture. But
since the meaning is obscure, we have to expose it. It seems that the text
means that a man commits a sin if, hearing that someone swears in false and
knowing that he swears in false, he is silent. He knows, if he has witnessed
the thing about which the oath is taken or if he saw it or knew it, that is, if
he knew it in any way, or seeing it with his own eyes or if he told it himself.
he made the oath. Well, he could know the thing in that way. Now, between the
fear of this sin and the fear of discovering others there is often a non-small
test. Because we can prevent the one who is willing to perjure from committing
such a great sin, either by reprimanding him or by forbidding him. If he does
not pay attention to us, and he swears in falsehood before us about something
we know, it is a very difficult question to know if we have to give him away,
if to incriminate him also incurs in danger of death. As the text does not say
here who should be told, if it is the one to whom it is sworn or the priest or
anyone who not only can not persecute him irrogiendo the torture, but can even
pray for him, it seems to me that the The person is free even from the bond of
sin if he tells those who can take advantage rather than harm the perjurer, or
to correct him or to appease God for him, if he himself uses the medicine of
confession.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>2 (Lv
5,2-3).</strong> After mentioning this kind of sin, consisting of not denouncing the
perjury of a person, the Scripture does not mandate to offer any sacrifice for
that sin. And then he adds: Whoever touches anything impure, whether it be from
a corpse, or from an impure animal captured by a wild beast, and from the things
that have died of impure abominations, the corpse of unclean hams, or touch
anything of the human impurities, of any impurity of the man with whom it is
stained, if he touches it, and does not realize it, but later he realizes and
becomes guilty. The sacrifice that had to be done for this kind of sin is not
mentioned here either, but the text adds the following: Whoever makes an oath
distinguishing with his lips doing evil or doing good according to all the
things that man distinguishes swear, and do not notice and know and commit one
of these sins, and confess the sin with the one who sinned against him (Lv 5,4).
United and explained all these things without any mention of sacrifice, the
text adds the following: And will offer to the Lord for these sins that he did,
for the sin he committed, a female, a sheep of the sheep or a goat of the goats
by the sin. The priest will make the atonement for him, for his sin, and the
sin will be forgiven (Lv 5,6).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What does
it mean that for a hidden perjury of a person and for touching a corpse or
something impure, the Scripture does not mention any sacrifice and, instead,
for the sin of making a false oath involuntarily send to sacrifice a sheep or a
goat? Should we think that this sacrifice must be offered for all the sins mentioned
above? In fact, the author preferred to list all the sins first and then say
with what sacrifice they had to expiate. But in all the genera of sins
mentioned above there is something expressed in a rather obscure way, due to
the expressions that Scripture uses, as, for example, when it says: the corpse
of the juices. The Greeks call kténe what many of our translators call
increments (jumentos). Now, this word in the usual Latin usage designates those
animals that are usually used mostly as pack animals, such as horses, donkeys,
mules, camels, and other animals like that. On the other hand, what the Greeks
call kténe has such a broad meaning that it can be understood under this name
to all or almost all the cattle. And therefore, in the Greek text was added
with a new kind of expression, as a pleonasm, the word impure, when mentioning
the juices, because there are also pure cattle, which are called kténe. On the
other hand, the animals that the habitual Latin language denominates jumentos,
according to the distinction that the law does, are only impure.</font></span></p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><br /></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><strong>3 (Lv
5,4).</strong> In relation to the text quoted above: Whoever makes an oath
distinguishing with his lips doing evil or doing good, can one wonder what
distinguishing (distinguuens) means, because this word appears many times in
Scripture. Thus, for example: I will fulfill my vows, which distinguished my
lips (Sal 65,13.14). In Ezekiel it is also said: If I say to the wicked:
"You will die without remedy", and you did not distinguish or speak. (Ez
3,18) And in another place it says: If a woman, being in her father's house,
made a vow, distinguishing with his lips against his soul (Nm 30,4). This
distinction seems to be a definition by which one thing is separated from the
others, which are not supported by the single word. Those words must be
understood as if it had been said: The person who makes an oath, defining with

the Lord for these sins that he made, for the sin he committed, a female, sheep

non-female sheep - or a goat of the goats. As a sheep sheep says, it also says
a goat of the goats, as if there could be a sheep that was not of the sheep or
a goat that was not of the goats. They raise a problem, a problem that is not
even small, the words that the text repeats frequently: after this it warns and
commits a crime, as if to say that sin is committed when it is known. Is it not
rather that, if you do not know, you can not offer satisfaction? But the text
does not say: after this he warns and repents. What does it mean, therefore,
after this is warned by j delinque? Is it about you committing a crime after
warning? So purification would be applied for crime if man had knowingly done
what he should not have done. But he did not say this before. And so it seems
that the Lord punishes the sins committed by those who do not realize and,
therefore, those who do not want to sin. The Scripture has perhaps used the
word delinque to mean "knew it is a crime." Or has it been said in
reverse order-since Scripture uses this kind of expression-what was said in
correct order in other similar places? Because, being written so many times in
other places in this way: And commits and warns, only here, as I said before,
it is said first, in reverse order, it warns, and then it is said and offended.

it is stained, if he touches it, and does not realize and commit a crime, but
then he realizes (Cf Lv 5,2.3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

doubts before is clarified. It seems that it is said: One for sin and another
for a burnt offering, precisely because no sacrifice for sin was offered if it
was not done with a burnt offering. Moreover, when speaking in particular about
holocausts, the text mentions turtledoves, but does not say that two were
offered. Now, on the other hand, he says that two should be offered justly,
because the sacrifice for sin was not offered without the holocaust. Therefore,
in relation to what was said before: And he will place it on the burnt offering

for him because of the mistake he made without realizing it and he will be
forgiven, because, indeed, he committed a crime before the Lord. Except for the
unusual density of expressions, which must already be totally familiar by the
continuous repetition of them, the whole meaning of this passage is obscure,
because we can ask how this kind of sin is distinguished from those that the
author mentioned before a general way The sense seems to require that for a
certain kind of sins some kind of sacrifices must be used to atone for them.
But what I have just said does not specifically express sin, but seems to remain
in that generality, according to which, speaking before the subject, the Lord
established that a bull be offered as a sacrifice for the priest, and a bull
also for all the assembly, a goat for the chief, and a goat or, if you prefer,
a sheep, female cattle, for any soul, that is, for any man (Cf Lv 4).
Afterwards, some kinds of sins were excepted, and to expressly say what
sacrifice had to be offered for each of the sins, such as, for example, the
perjury, heard and hidden, of someone; touching a corpse or an impure thing;
the false oath by inadvertence, by which it was necessary to offer a sheep of
the sheep, or a goat of the goats, or a pair of turtledoves, or a pair of
pigeon pigeons, or the tenth part of a measure of flour of flour . For the one
who had sinned, usurping by forgetfulness something of the holy things, the
Lord ordered to offer a ram and the restitution of the thing, adding a fifth
more. Now, without expressly saying the kind of sin, it is added in a general
way: Whoever sins and does something that should not be done against any
precept of the Lord - in that general statement it said: Something that will
not be done against the precepts of the Lord -And do not realize and become
guilty, that is, sin by ignorance without wanting to, offers to offer a ram,
not a goat or a female sheep, as he had previously ordered, when speaking of
sins in that general way. What does this mixture then mean? When saying here:
Because he committed a crime before the Lord, the expression before the Lord
may mean the sin that is committed in the things that are done before the Lord,
that is, in the things through which the Lord is worshiped in the Lord.
tabernacle. About this something had already been said before, when he
affirmed: He sinned against the holy things, (Lv 5,15) and we interpreted it in
the sense that he "usurped something of the holy things", since the
Lord had also ordered to restore it. Therefore, in these things one can not sin
only in this way, usurping something by forgetfulness, but one can sin in
addition to many other ways, through ignorance in the things that are used in
the service of God. The author wanted to mention this kind of sins in a general
way, and that is why, both here and here, the Lord commanded to offer a ram.
The Scriptures are replete with expressions like this: before the Lord, and
they mean nothing more than what is offered to the Lord, such as sacrifice or
firstfruits or some service in sacred things.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

presented: If your hand does not have enough to offer a sheep, it must always
be taken in the sense that the person must offer a pair of turtle doves or a
couple of pigeon chicks, and, if I could not even do this, I would offer a
certain amount of flour. Because, if it is understood that it is always lawful
to do this, it can not be said in any way that the priest does not have a bull
or that the whole assembly or the chief does not have a goat or a sheep. And if
so, what need was there to say after the hidden perjury of a person or the act
of touching something impure, and perjury made out of ignorance, were expiated
with the sacrifice of a sheep and a goat, while Are those same sacrifices also
prescribed in that general indication of sin to which these sins also belong?
But if these sins are distinguished here, because it was lawful to offer
turtledoves or pigeons for them, or even fine flour if one did not have those
other things, and there, where nothing is said, it was not lawful, then it does
not seem that helped the poor, because there could be many sins not explicitly

total equity, since, if they did not have any quadruped animal, they could
offer the aforementioned birds or the flour for the sins committed by

This, according to our way of speaking, should be expressed as follows: Every
sin committed by man, except fornication, remains outside his body; but whoever
fornicates, sins against his own body. The same happens here: The author spoke
first in a general way, referring to all the sins of ignorance and mentioning
the sacrifices with which they should atone; then he exempted those sins that,
mentioned in an express and distinct way, needed special sacrifices to be atoned
for. And so, except for these sins, all the others that were, would enter into

price in which he sinned, as if it meant: "in the price he sinned",
but: "if he offers a ram, he will offer it for a price", that is, it
will be bought. It seems that the Lord also wanted this to have some mysterious
meaning, because he did not define the price. If he had established it, it
might seem that he ordered that an animal of little value be offered in
sacrifice, so that, even if the one who offered it did not buy it, he would
offer something that would have value. But, adding, not only the price, so that
a purchased ram was offered, but also mentioning the shekels, the holy shekel -

thing, because of that thing. And he will remove the holocarpoma to which the
fire has reduced that holocaust of next to the altar (Lv 6,10). What will be
withdrawn, if it has been consumed? The Lord orders the priest to remove the
holocarpoma, the holocaust that the fire consumed, after burning all night. And
what does that word mean: the holocaust, if holocarpoma means the same as a
holocaust? Perhaps it is true what is found in a Greek text, in which it is not
said: it will remove the holocarposis (the holocaust), but: it will remove the
catacarposis (the ashes of the holocaust), that is, the remains of the
holocaust that consumed the fire . To these remains, such as ashes and coal,

It is necessary to investigate whether tomorrow means daily, so that no day

means that on any day when the fire was set it should only be put on the

no one contributed with what? But if the priests sought the daily burnt

question arises of knowing what difference there is between sin and crime,
because if there were no difference, it would not be said: As is the sacrifice
for sin, so is the sacrifice for crime. Well, although the law and its
sacrifice do not differ in anything, since for both the same law governs,
however, these two things that have the same sacrifice, sin and crime, if they
were not differentiated into anything and were two names for the same thing,
the Scripture would not worry so much about saying that the sacrifice of both
is the same.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Well, sin
may be the execution of evil, and crime, the abandonment of good. And as in a
life worthy of praise one thing is to turn away from evil and another to do
good, as the Scripture recommends us with these words: Depart from evil and do
good, (Ps. 36,37) so, too, in a life worthy of reproach, one thing it is to
turn away from good and another to do evil, and that would be the crime, and
this would be sin. For the rest, if we discuss the word itself, what else
sounds delictum (crime) but derelictum (left)? And what does the offender leave
but the good? The Greeks have also put two usual words to designate this
plague. Because delictum (crime), in Greek, corresponds to paraptoma and
plemmalleia. In this passage of Leviticus plemmalleia appears. When the Apostle
says: If anyone commits a crime, (Ga 6,1) the paraptomati appears in the Greek.
Now, if we analyze the origin of these terms, we see that paraptomate is
understood as the one who commits the crime, from where the corpse comes, a
word that the Latins derived from cadendo (to fall), and in Greek ptoma comes
from apò tou piptein, is say, to fall. For that reason, whoever does evil
sinning, before falling from good by committing crimes. On the other hand,
plemmalleia is a term that designates something akin to negligence. Because
negligence is said in Greek améleia, since one does not care what one is
negligent about. That is why in Greek it is said: ou méléi moi: «I do not
care». And the particle pla, which is added to form plemméleia, means "out
of". And so améleia, which means "negligence," seems like it
amounts to "without care", and plemméleia "out of care,"
which is almost the same. Therefore, some of our translators chose to translate
plemméleian for negligence and not for crime. And in the Latin language, what
else is negligitur (one looks with negligence) but what is non-legitur (not
chosen), that is, non eligitur (not chosen)? That is also why Latin authors
have said that the law (legem) comes from legendo (choosing), that is, choosing
(choosing). Through these clues follows in a certain way that delinque
(delinquit) who leaves (derelinquit) the good and leaving it falls well,
because it is negligent (neglegit), that is, does not choose (non eligit). With
regard to the word sin, which in Greek is called amartía, it does not occur to
me at the moment, in either of these two languages, where it comes from.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It may
also seem that crime is what is done imprudently, through ignorance, and sin,
which is done consciously. This difference seems supported by the following
texts of Scripture: Who knows their crimes? (Ps. 18,3) And this other: Well,
you knew my imprudence. And the author immediately adds: And my crimes are not
unknown to you (Ps. 68,6), as if repeating the same idea in another way. And it
is not in disagreement with this the sentence of the Apostle mentioned before:
If someone commits some crime. By speaking here that "if one incurs,"
it means that he has fallen imprudently. That sin belongs to the sphere of
consciousness says the apostle James, giving a kind of definition of it: He who
knows how to do good and does not do it, commits a sin (St 4,17). Well, be that
that is, or whatever the difference between sin and crime, if there were no
difference between them, the Scripture would not say what it says: As is the
sacrifice for sin, so is sacrifice for the crime: its law is the same (Lv 6,37
7,7).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In spite
of what has been said, those two words are often used interchangeably, so that
sin is called crime, and crime, sin. Thus, when it is said that in baptism sins
are forgiven, it is not necessary to understand that crimes are not also
forgiven. And in spite of everything the two words are not used, because in the
term sin both concepts are included. In this same sense, the Lord says that his
blood will be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins (Cf Mt 26,28). Since he
does not mention crimes, is there anyone who dares to say that by his blood crimes
are not forgiven? The same thing must be said of the text of the Apostle when
he says: Because judgment, starting from a single one, leads to condemnation;
but grace, based on many crimes, leads to justification (Rm 5,16). Evidently,
under the name of crimes, sins are also understood.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">In the
text of Leviticus itself, in which we are forced to find or see some difference
between crime and sin, the following is read, when God speaks of the sacrifices
to be offered for sins: But if the whole assembly of the children of Israel sin
out of ignorance and the fact remains hidden from the eyes of the assembly and
does something that should not be done against any precept of the Lord and
commit a crime and the sin they committed was known to them (Lv 4,13.14). When
he says here and commits a crime, he immediately adds: the sin they committed,
that is, the same sin that was previously called a crime.</span></p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Then he
continues: But if a leader sins and unintentionally does something that should
not be done against any precept of the Lord his God and delinquent (Lv 4,22).
And the same then: But if any person of the people of the earth sin without
wanting it, doing something that should not do against any precept of the Lord
and commits crimes and warns of the sin he committed (Lv 4,27.28). The same in
another passage: Whoever makes an oath distinguishing with his lips doing evil
or doing good according to all the things that man distinguishes by swearing
and does not notice and know and commit one of these sins and confess the sin
with whom he sinned against him, and he will offer a sacrifice for the things
he committed against the Lord, for the sin he committed (Lv 5,4-6). And shortly
afterwards he adds: And the Lord spoke to Moses saying: If a person deceives by
forgetfulness and sins unintentionally against the holy things of the Lord, and
because of his offense he will offer to the Lord a ram of the flock, without
blemish, for a price, according to the price of silver shekels, of the holy
shekel, for the crime that he committed, and for the sin he committed against
holy things, he will restore what was defrauded and add a fifth more, and give
it to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of
the crime and he will be forgiven (Lv 5,14-16). The text continues: Whoever
sins and does something that should not be done against any precept of the Lord
and does not realize and become guilty and accept his sin, and offer a ram of
the flock, without defect, according to the price of money, as a sacrifice for
the crime to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him because of
the mistake he made without realizing it, and he will be forgiven, because he
did commit a crime before the Lord. And he continues saying: And the Lord spoke
to Moses saying: "Whoever sins and scornfully disregards the precepts of
the Lord and lies in relation to what concerns the neighbor about something
entrusted or deposited or stolen, or does some injury to the neighbor or find
something lost and lie about it and swear unjustly about anything that man
usually does, sinning in those things, it will happen that when he has sinned
and committed and will return what he has stolen or the injury he caused or
what is entrusted or given to him in deposit, or the lost object that he found
or all the things for which he swore unjustly; he will return it in full and
add a fifth more, returning it to whoever had it on the day he was convinced.
And for his offense he will offer to the Lord a ram of the flock, without blemish,
for a price, for what he committed, and the priest will make atonement for him
before the Lord and he will be forgiven any of all the things he did and the
crime that he committed (Lv 6,1-7). In conclusion, almost always that Scripture
mentions sins, it also says that those sins are crimes. Therefore, it is
evident from many passages of Scripture that, on the one hand, these two terms
are used interchangeably, and on the other, that there is some difference
between them, when the sacred text says: As is the sacrifice for sin, so it is
also the sacrifice for the crime.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

destroyed by wild beasts may be used for anything, but it can not be eaten as
food. Everyone who eats fat from the animals that tend to offer themselves as
victims for the Lord, that individual will be exterminated from his people.
About fat, the Scripture had said before: All fat is for the Lord (Lv 3,16).
And we had asked ourselves if it would refer only to the fat of every pure
animal - because about the fat of impure animals there is no problem - and what
was to be done with the fat, which the Scripture forbids to eat. Now he says
what must be done with the fat of a dead animal and an animal torn apart by
wild beasts, and says that it can be used for anything. For anything,
obviously, for which fat is necessary. Therefore, the question remains to know
what is done with the fat of other animals that are pure and that can be eaten.
By saying that every person who eats the fat of the animals offered to the Lord
will be exterminated from his people, it seems that it is only said that it is
forbidden to eat the fat of the pure animals offered in sacrifice, even though
we have heard that Jews do not eat any fat. But here we do not inquire what the
Jews thought, but what the Scripture prescribes. Finally, they do not know what
to do Correctly with the fat, from which they are deprived, nor how they have
to get rid of it, since it says: All the fat is for the Lord, if they want to

But why does he speak here and there of the part that covers the liver? Is

bullock had to be offered for the sin of the priest who had caused the people
to sin. Later also, when the Scripture describes how the things that the Lord
commanded with Aaron and his sons, he says that a bull was offered for sin (Cf
Lv 8,2). But first he commanded that the horns of the altar of incense should
be anointed with the blood of the bullock, that it should be sprinkled with
that same blood in the direction of the holy veil, and that the rest of the
blood be poured out at the base of the altar of burnt offerings. . But later,
when Aaron is consecrated, nothing is said of the sprinkling of the blood in
the direction of the veil. Of the horns of the altar it is spoken, but it is
not added of the incense. It is said that the blood spills next to the base of
the altar (Lv 8,15). The text does not say: next to its base, as if it were
necessary to think that it was that altar, whose horns had been anointed with
blood. Therefore, although the text is expressed ambiguously, however, it is
one free to think that it was done as it had been ordered before about the bull
for sin. And so we are not forced to think that the horns of that altar were
anointed at whose base the blood was spilled, but the horns of the altar of
incense were anointed, and the blood was spilled next to the base of the
sacrificial altar.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Previously,
the Scripture ordered that, if the priest sinned, the anointed and consecrated
priest himself, who undoubtedly must be understood that he refers to the high
priest, offered these sacrifices, because the Scripture then spoke in a general
way. Now, when Aaron is consecrated, Moses offers and he himself receives the breast
of the imposition, which, as the Scripture said before, had to be given to the
priest (Cf Lv 8,29). I think it is called the breast of imposition, because he
put on his fat, as the Scripture recalled before, when speaking of the
sacrifice of salvation (Cf Lv 4,10). Well, since it seems that the high
priesthood began with Aaron, what do we think Moses was? If he was not a
priest, how could he do all those things? If so, how do we claim that the high
priesthood began with his brother? Although even that psalm, in which Moses and
Aaron are said to be among his priests (Ps. 98,6), remove the doubt that Moses
was a priest, yet Aaron and his successors, the high priests, are ordered to
accept that priestly garment that It contains a great mystery (Cf Ex 28,3-39).
In the Exodus, before anything was said about the consecration and, in a
certain way, the ordination of the priests, when on going up the mountain Moses
was told not to raise the priests (Cf Ex 19,24), which can not be other than
the sons of Aaron, not because they already were, but because they were to be,
the Scripture already called them then in advance. There are many examples of
such expressions, such as, for example, when Ship's son is called Joshua (Cf Ex
33,11), when the Scripture says that this name was imposed much later (Cf Nm
13,17). In conclusion, the two, Moses and Aaron, were then high priests. Or
maybe it was Moses, and Aaron was subject to it? Or maybe it was Aaron for the
pontifical vesture and Moses for his highest ministry? Why is not Moses told
from the beginning: He will be for you in relation to the things that refer to
the people, and you will be for him in relation to the things that refer to
God?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It may
also be asked, who, after Moses died, anointed the high priest, since no one
could succeed him until he had died? Or because he was already anointed among
the priests of the second rank-since the oil with which he anointed himself to
the high priest and to the priests of the second rank was the same-did that
pontiff only wear the garment that revealed his supreme category? If the
reality is this, did he take the garment himself or did someone else give it to
him, as, after his death, Moses gave it to his brother's son as well? If the
garment was worn by another, could a priest who was a second-rank priest be the
high priest, thinking above all that it was a garment that needed to be put on
by someone else? Or did he put on this garment first, how would he wear it
afterwards? Effectively. For once he is dressed, it is not that he did not wear
it; or once put, do not put it on again. It could happen that the priests of
the second rank dressed the first, out of obedience, not to stand out. But by
what was demonstrated which of the children should happen to the high priest?
The Scripture, in effect, does not say that it must be the firstborn or the
eldest. One would think that it would be useful to know oneself by some divine
sign manifested through some prophet or in any other way that God usually acts.
Although it seems that the matter was the subject of a discussion, so that
later there were many high priests precisely because, discussing among
themselves the most conspicuous to settle the issue, this honor was given to
many.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the priesthood: Will you sit seven days, day and night, at the entrance to the
tabernacle of the testimony so that you do not die? Is it credible that they
were commanded to sit in one place in that bodily situation for seven days, day
and night, so that they would not move at all from there? It does not follow
from this text that we are forced to admit that we have been told something in
the allegorical sense, that it should not be done, but that it should be
understood. The reality is that it is more about recognizing a way of
expressing oneself in the Scriptures, according to which "to sit"
means "to live" or "to remain". Thus, for example, because
the Scripture says that Semei was sitting in Jerusalem for three years (Cf 1R
2,38), it is not necessary to think that during all that time he was sitting in
a chair without getting up. This is also called seat to the place where the
settlers have their residence. This is also called a place of habitation.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

(senatum), the Greek calls it gerousan. The Latin translator literally followed
that word, because senatus (senado) seems to come from senium (old age). In
Latin it would not be said correctly: he called the old age of Israel instead
of: he called the old or the old. Although it would be the same expression if
it were said: he called the youth of Israel instead of: he called the young
people. But this expression is used in the Latin language and that other is
not. Because this would be a proper saying if it were said: he called Israel's
old age. That is why some, thinking that sometimes is also translated by
Senate, translated: the order of the elders. In short, perhaps it would be
better said: he called the elders of Israel.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

Moses says to Aaron: Speak to the senate of Israel, saying, "Take a goat
from the goats for the sin offering and a ram and a bull and a one-year-old
bull, without blemish, for the burnt offering; and a young bull of the oxen and
a ram for the sacrifice of salvation before the Lord and fine flour mingled
with oil; because today the Lord will appear to you ». The Scripture mentions
here four species of animal sacrifices: the holocaust, the sacrifice for sin,
the sacrifice of salvation and the sacrifice of consummation. But the sacrifice
of consummation belongs to the sanctification of the priest. Therefore, the
other three kinds of sacrifices are commanded here and this is said to the
elders of Israel, so that it corresponds to all the people. In this text, the
sacrifice for sin has three animals: the kid, the ram and the bull. The lamb of
one year belongs to the holocaust. The bull and the ram belong to the sacrifice
of salvation. Therefore, it is not necessary to distinguish, affirming that in
the sacrifice by the sin it is only necessary to understand that a kid was
offered, whereas the other three animals were offered in the holocaust, that is
to say, the ram, the steer and the lamb of one year. Rather it is rather that
the first three were offered in the sacrifice for sin. And for that, the words
of the Scripture: Take a kid of the goats for the sacrifice for sin and a ram
and a bull, they refer to the sacrifice for sin, and the lamb of one year for
the burnt offering remains.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The reason
we have made this observation is that the following distinction can also be
made: Take a goat from the goats for the sacrifice for sin. And the rest of the
passage would refer to the holocaust. The words that are added later: without
defect, can refer to all. Now, as there is doubt about which is the best way to
separate the words, it comes to the solution that we have given that the first
three animals refer to the sacrifice for sin, since before it was ordered to
offer a kid for sin of the boss (Cf Lv 4,23). For the sin of each one of the
people when they sin before the Lord doing something that should not be done,
he ordered to offer a ram (Cf Lv 5,18). And for the sin of the whole assembly,
a steer (Cf Lv 4,14). Therefore, it was advisable that, in telling the Senate
what all the people had to offer, it would be logical that they should offer a
goat for the chiefs and a ram for the sin of each person, and a bull for the
sin of all the Assembly. Because it is one thing for the people to have their
sin and that everyone can have their own, and another thing when sin is common,
that it is done with one intention and something is committed with only one
will, the community.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But the
fact that the Scripture commands to offer a bull and a ram as sacrifices of
salvation, is that it sends the main thing, for the sake of all the people. But
when he spoke before the sacrifices of salvation, he ordered that either a male
or a female be offered indistinctly, as long as they were either cows and sheep
or goats (Cf Lv 3,1-11; 12-17). If you inquire why he ordered that two animals
be offered, a bull and a ram, it is difficult to know. Unless it is said that
he ordered to offer a bull, as a sacrifice of salvation for all the people, and
one ram for each, as if it were each and every one, because it seems that he
also ordered to offer as two species of sacrifices. of salvation: one, who was
like everyone else and who called the sacrifice of salvation (Cf Lv 3,1), and
another when he said: If someone offered the sacrifice of their salvation (Lv
7,19 29). In this text we also found a difference, because in that place where
he spoke of the sacrifice of salvation, the fat of the chest, which had to be
offered to the Lord, was not mentioned and said that the priest had to be given
the chest and the right leg (Cf Lv 7,20.21 30.31). But in that passage he
ordered that what was later called the sacrifice of his salvation be done, a
sacrifice that may be private, of each one of the faithful, and not public, of
all. Because even Moses offered sacrifices of salvation, and there was no
mention (sacrifices) of his salvation. I think he offered the sacrifice for all
the people, because where everyone is, everyone is also there; but where each
one is, they are not necessarily all there. For everything can exist without
the totality; but all can not exist except from each one in particular; since
each one united to the others or taken as a sum do the whole.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It must be
noted, of course, that when sacrifices are offered by the people, it is
commanded to offer not only sacrifices for sin, but also burnt offerings and
sacrifices of salvation. On the other hand, sacrifices for sin and holocausts
and sacrifices of consummation are offered by the priest, but not sacrifices of
salvation. The sacrifice of consummation was offered when the priests were
consecrated to exercise the priesthood, and these are the sacrifices offered by
Moses for Aaron and for his children (Cf Lv 8). But then, Aaron himself, once
consecrated and already performing the priestly functions, was ordered to offer
for himself a bull as a sacrifice for sin and a ram as a holocaust (Cf Lv 9,2ss).
He did not receive the order to offer the consummation sacrifice himself,
because it was then offered precisely so that it would be consummated with the
consecration and able to perform the priestly functions, and, since he already
performed them, it did not have to be consummated again. .</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

9,7).</strong> And Moses said to Aaron, "Come near the altar and offer the
sacrifice for your sin and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself
and your household." It is striking that he first says that he must offer
the sacrifice for sin and then the burnt offering, when shortly before he
orders the sacrifices for sins to be placed on top of the burnt offerings (Cf
Lv 4,35), except when it comes to birds (Cf Lv 5, 8-10). Or is it that what is
done before, that is, the holocaust, is mentioned here? For here it is not said
as when the birds were spoken: first do this and then that, but say: do this
and that. The instruction set out above indicates what needs to be done before.
It says that the sacrifice for sins must be placed on top of the holocaust. The
fact that the Scripture says, in addition that Aaron did what he was commanded,
poses a serious problem, because first he is reminded that he must make the
sacrifice for sin and then the holocaust. But it would not be safe for him to
have done it first or the Scripture would have narrated first what was done
next, as is often the case in many places, unless it was read in the text what
I said earlier, when the author tried to sacrifice the sin. For the text says:
And the priest shall put it on the altar upon the burnt offering of the Lord.
And the priest will make atonement for him, for the sin he committed and he
will be forgiven (Lv 4,35). How could this be put on the holocaust, if the
holocaust was not put on before? But about the sacrifice of salvation, he was
ordered to stand on top of the burnt offering (Cf Lv 3,5). And as this is not
said in all places, nor for all the sacrifices of salvation, nor for all the
sacrifices for sin, it may be said that this was not regularly prescribed, but
was said there only to be done in the sacrifice of salvation, when a bullock is
offered-for there it was ordained thus-and in the sacrifice for sin, when a
female of the sheep is offered. On the other hand, it is not necessary that the
other sacrifices, whether of salvation or sin, be placed on the burnt
offerings.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The
question is also raised that, when Aaron made the offering of the people (Cf Lv
9,7), mentioned above, it is not said that all the things that were commanded
were sacrificed, but only the kid for sin and the burnt offering. And there was
no express mention of the lamb of a year old. And the other two things we said
that belonged rather to the sacrifice for sin than to the holocaust, that is,
the ram and the bull, were omitted. Unless the author wanted to refer to the
whole by the part, so that, mentioning only the kid, we considered that other
things had taken place.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">When the
Scripture describes how Aaron made the people's sacrifices of salvation, he
says the following about the bull and the ram: He also immolated the bullock
and the ram of the people's sacrifice of salvation. And the sons of Aaron
brought him the blood and poured it all around the altar. And they brought to
him also the fat of the bull and the ram, the loin and the fat that covers the
belly, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and what is left by the
liver. And he put these fats on the breasts of the victims and put the fats on
top of the altar. And Aaron removed his breast and his right leg, as a thing
taken away from the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. When speaking of the
two animals, the bull and the ram, the Scripture speaks sometimes in the
singular and sometimes in the plural. Thus, when talking about the two kidneys,
we must understand that it is about the two animals and, therefore, there are
four kidneys. And so on from the rest. But what do the words mean: And he put
the fats on the breasts of the victims, being that he did not order to place
the breasts on the altar - because they had to be given to the priest with the
right legs? Or should we understand the text like this: And put the fats on the
breasts? Because he put them to place on the altar once removed from the
breasts. In effect, that's what he had sent before. Then he goes on: And he put
the fats on the altar, and Aaron removed his chest and his right leg as a thing
taken away from the Lord. Now he speaks in the singular and mentions,
certainly, the breast of the two animals, which he had previously called
breasts in the plural.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

blessed them and went down, having offered the sin offering, and the burnt
offerings and the sacrifice of salvation. What does this mean? Where did he do
this but on the altar, standing next to the altar and serving the altar?
Therefore, he came down from where he was. It seems clear that the solution to
that question that we had raised in the Exodus about how he could have served
the altar, which was three cubits high, can benefit from this testimony. There
we were forbidden to admit that they were tiered, because God had forbidden it,
so that the prudent parts of the officiant would not be exposed on the altar,
which would happen if the step was a part of the altar, that is, if it were
united in compact form. Finally, this was forbidden there where it was an altar
made of several pieces. For the altar would be a thing with the tier, and the
tier would be a part of the altar, and that is why it was forbidden. But here,
where the height of the altar had been so great that if the priest had not been
standing on something, could not properly officiate, you have to understand
that whatever it was that was put and removed during the time of the offices,
was not a part of the altar and, therefore, did not go against the precept that
prohibited the altar had tiers. The Scripture omitted to speak of this,
whatever it was, and that is why the problem has arisen. But now, when he says
that the priest, when he offered the sacrifices, came down, after placing the
immolated things on the altar, it is evident, evidently, that the priest had to
be somewhere so that he could get down from there. And since he had been there,
he could serve and officiate at an altar three cubits high.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

daring to put profane fire in their censers, placing incense to offer it to the
Lord -which was forbidden, because all the things that had to be lit in the
tabernacle they had to be lit from the fire that had come by divine will to the
altar and which was then kept - after the dead, then, Moses said: This is what
the Lord has declared, saying: “Among those who come near me I will show my
holiness, and before the whole assembly I will manifest my glory.” (Lv 10,3)
Those who approach the Lord are those who performed the priestly functions in
the tabernacle. Showing holiness in them means also applying the punishment, as
it happened. But what we do not know is whether he said this so that we would
draw the conclusion that if he does not forgive them, how much less does he
have to forgive others - and in this sense the Scripture says: If the just will
barely be saved, in What will stop the sinner and the impious? (Pr 11,31; 1P
4,18) or if he said it rather according to the meaning of that other text: To
whom more is given, more is required, and from that other: The servant who did
not know the will of his Lord and do things worthy of scourge, will receive few
lashes; On the other hand, the servant who knew the will of his lord and does
things worthy of scourging, will receive many lashes (Lc 12,48.47), and of that
other: For the little one will be granted mercy; on the other hand, the
powerful will suffer great torments (Sab 6,7). But in the texts of Scripture
prior to this one is not found where the Lord said what Moses says the Lord
told him. The same happens here as in the Exodus, when Moses says to the Lord:
You have said: "I know you more than all," (Ex 33,12) which we know
with certainty that the Lord told him, but later. Now, since Moses would never
tell a lie about this matter, it is understood that he had also said this
before, even if it is not written. The same must be said in the present case.
By this example it is shown that everything God has said is not written to
those through whom his holy Scripture has been transmitted to us.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

to mourn the death of those two other brothers: You will not remove from your
head the cidara, where it clearly appears that the cidaras were objects to
cover the head? The explanation is that those who cried, would do what was
contrary to the custom of adornment. As according to our customs, the head is
usually uncovered and covered because of mourning, so also those who were
crying had to discover the head, because those people adorned themselves by
covering their heads. And Moses forbids them to mourn those with whose
punishment the Lord was honored, that is, their fear was recommended. And he
did not forbid it because they were not worthy of weeping-for he allows others
to weep-but because they should not mourn then, since they were celebrating the
days of his consecration, since the seven days had not yet passed in the who
commanded them not to leave the tabernacle. And since they had been consecrated
by that oil, it might seem that this was said because they should never cry to
anyone. For the text says: But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, will

other fermented drink, neither you nor your children, when you enter the
tabernacle of the testimony or when you approach the altar, lest you die."
According to this, when could they drink, since they had to enter the
tabernacle every day and approach the altar because of the continuous services?
And if someone says that they did not offer sacrifices every day, what can you
say about the entrance into the tabernacle, which took place every day to put
the candlestick and the showbread on the table? And if it is answered that what
is now said refers to the tabernacle of the testimony, where the ark of the
covenant was, it must be answered that the high priest also had to enter there
because of the perpetuation of the incense. For he did not enter once a year,
but entered once a year with the blood of purification, and every day for the
sake of incense. Or is it necessary to understand that the Lord commanded them
never to drink wine? Why then did he not rather command it in a brief way,
saying: "You shall not drink wine, but he added: When you enter the
tabernacle or when you approach the altar? Is it perhaps that there was no
reason to silence the cause of not drinking, especially knowing beforehand that
there would be so many, even high priests, at the same time, that is, not by
succession, who would officiate in turn? in the tabernacle, and in the
sacrifices, and in the incense, and in all that ministry, when those who were
officiating did not drink, but the others drank? Or what else does this text
mean? Because, after forbidding the priests to drink wine and fermented
beverages, the text adds: This is an eternal decree for your descendants (Lv
10,9). But it is doubtful whether these words should be linked to the previous
sentence, the matter of not drinking wine, or the next, which says: To
distinguish between the holy and the profane and between the pure and the
impure and to teach the children of Israel all the precepts that the Lord has
given them through Moses (Lv 10,10.11). This would be the eternal decree for
his descendants, Corresponding to the office of the priests. With regard to the
eternal word we have already said many times how it should be understood. But
the meaning of the phrase is also ambiguous: Distinguish between the holy and
the profane and between the pure and the impure. The question is whether the
author wanted to say that priests should distinguish between holy things and
pure or profane and impure, or between the saints and pure or stained and
impure, that is, if it is sacred things, that they would do well or badly or of
the men that had to be approved or reprobated, or rather we should refer the

more about healing? Because in the psalm that says: Hear us, God of our healings

asked about the kid sacrificed for the sins of the people and did not find it,
because he had already been burned, he was angry because the Lord had commanded
that those things that had to be offered by the people as a sacrifice for sin
had to be eaten by the priests , removing fats and kidneys. Moses was enraged,
not against his brother, but against his children (Cf 10,16-9). And I think he
did it because it corresponded to his ministry to admonish them. Aaron answered
him, saying: If today they offered their sacrifices for sin and their burnt
offerings before the Lord and such things happened to me, and I will eat today
the victim for sin, will this please the Lord? Moses heard it and liked it (Lv
10,19.20). It seems that Aaron says that, on the same day that the children of
Israel had first offered the sacrifice for their sin, this sacrifice should not
have been eaten by the Israelites, but burned in its entirety, without making
this a rule. for the other sacrifices, because later the priests ate sacrifices
for sins. But, since this was offered for the first time on the first day, it
is necessary to think that the priest Aaron said this by divine inspiration, so
that later the priests could observe what the Lord had commanded Moses; and
what Aaron said, as inspired by God, Moses approved.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">What
happened, then, with the other sacrifices of that day, that is, with the ram
and with the bull, which, as we said, should also be considered as offered by
sin? Or is it that there is no problem about the bull, since the sacrifice had
to be made in such a way that part of his blood was introduced, as ordered, to
touch with it the horns of the altar of incense, and it was natural that will
the whole animal burn? (Cf Lv 4,17-20) And what was to be done with the ram? As
Moses asked first for the kid, should we also apply to the ram what was said to
him about the kid, about which he had to ask, as he had been commanded, if the
priest's answer had not satisfied him? About the bull, what would he ask, since
the sacrifice had been made according to the law, which God had commanded
concerning the bull sacrificed for the sin of the whole assembly, just as it
had been commanded concerning the bull sacrificed for sin of the priest, that
is to say, that he had to be burned completely outside the camp? (Cf Lv 4,12-21)
For these are the words that Moses said, angered against his brother's sons,
because he had not found the kid offered for sin, which he had sought; I had
not found it, because I had been burned completely. He says to them: Why have
you not eaten in a holy place the victim of the sacrifice for sin? Since they
are very holy things, this gave you to eat so that you would remove the sin of
the assembly and make atonement for it before the Lord. Because his blood had
not been introduced into the sanctuary, you will eat the victim in a sacred
place, as the Lord ordered me to do. When he says: Because his blood had not
been introduced into the sanctuary in his presence, he distinguishes,
undoubtedly, what is done for the sin of the priest or for the sin of the whole
assembly, not the kid, who should not have burned himself He had not sent his
blood to touch the horns of the altar of incense, but to be consumed by the
priests. Aaron tells Moses why this was done, that is, why the kid was totally
burned, and Moses was satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Certainly,
the Scripture commanded the elders of the people to offer themselves six
animals for the people. Of those six animals mentioned first four, the kid, the
ram, the steer and the one-year-old lamb of one year. -The kid, naturally, as a
sacrifice for sin; and the lamb of one year, of one year, evidently, too, as a
holocaust. As for the two animals in the middle, that is, the ram and the bull,
we have seen that they are mentioned in a somewhat ambiguous way, because we do
not know if they belonged to the sacrifice for sin and we would have to add
them to the kid, or more. well to the lamb of one year, to offer them as a
holocaust - on this issue I have already exposed what I think instead. But
then, to complete the list of the six animals, the Scripture mentions the bull
and the ram, as a sacrifice of salvation; and then, when they immolate
themselves and mention themselves in the same way, the same animals, the ram
and the bull, which had previously been placed between the goat and the lamb of
one year, are not mentioned, but only that bull and that ram that is they had
sent to offer as a sacrifice of salvation. In this way we no longer have to
think that it was six animals, but only four. We may think that those two who
had first placed themselves between the goat and the lamb of one year, were
mentioned again and there is no other bull or other ram as a sacrifice of
salvation, so that by saying that the kid was like a sacrifice for sin and by
not saying what the ram and the bull were for, that is, for what sacrifice they
served, and by saying that the one-year-old lamb was like a holocaust, then he
would have wanted to say what was to be done with the bull and with the ram,
which had not been commanded to offer as a sacrifice for sin, as the kid, nor
as a burnt offering, as the lamb of one year, but as a sacrifice of salvation.
If we understand the text in this way, it remains the question of why a kid was
offered for the sin of the assembly, when, speaking from the beginning of the
sacrifices that had to be offered for sins, the Lord commanded that it be
offered a bull for the sin of the assembly. And because of the sin of the
priest, he commanded that he offer himself, not a goat, but a young bull. Near
this bull, he also ordered that his blood be introduced inside, as well as the
blood of the victim for the priest's sin, to touch with it. the horns of the
altar of incense (Cf Lv 4,3).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">We can ask
what reason there could be for Aaron's sin, not only Moses to offer a bullock (Cf
Lv 8,14), but Aaron himself to offer another bullock (Cf Lv 9,8), as had to be
offered for the sin of the priest, according to God's precept. And on the other
hand, because of the sin of the people, a bull was not offered, as it was
commanded, but rather a kid. In considering this problem, it seemed to us, as
we said before, that not only was a goat offered for the sin of the people, but
also a ram and a bull. In this way, these three sacrifices must be understood
as sacrifices for sin, since the chiefs are part of the people, and they had to
offer a kid for them. And besides, each person could have their own sins, and
for them a ram was offered. And finally, they all had some sin, and for them
they offered themselves a bull. For the sin of the whole assembly a bull was to
be offered, as commanded from the beginning. Therefore, once they have
sacrificed themselves, only the kid is mentioned, but also tacitly
understanding the others, as when part is taken for the whole, because all
those sacrifices were for sins.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

she will be unclean for seven days; it will be impure according to the days of
their separation. On the eighth day he will circumcise the flesh of the child's
foreskin; but he will remain inactive thirty-three days in his pure blood. He
will not touch anything holy or enter the sanctuary. What difference is there
between those seven days when it is impure, it is said, and the thirty-three
days that it will remain inactive in its pure blood? Because if he is no longer
impure during the thirty-three days, why can not he touch the holy? Is there
still this difference, which is with blood, but with pure blood? Would the
difference be that, when it is impure, it makes impure to wherever it is, and
when it is already with pure blood, only it is not lawful for it to touch the
holy and enter the sanctuary? For this is what it says: According to the days
of separation from your purification. For the Scripture says elsewhere that the
impurity of the woman who has menstruation lasts seven days, and during this
time all that she feels about will be impure (Cf Lv 15,19.23). The text speaks
of separation, because the woman separated a little so as not to stain
everything, while those days passed. The law doubled these days of impurity and
turned them into fourteen, if the woman gave birth to a female. The other days
that he stayed with his pure blood the law had also ordered that they doubled,
since they were sixty-six. Therefore, the days in the case of the birth of a
man were forty, and in the case of the birth of a female, eighty. Notwithstanding
the above, some Greek codices do not have with their pure blood, but with their
impure blood.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the tabernacle of the testimony. The priest will offer it before the Lord and
make atonement for it and purify it from the flow of his blood. This is the law
for those who give birth to a male or a female. But if he does not find enough
to offer a Lamb, he will take two turtledoves or two pigeon pigeons, one as a
holocaust and the other as a sacrifice for sin. The priest will make atonement
for her and will be purified (Lv 12,6-8). Therefore, the correct reading of the
previous text is not: It will offer a one-year-old Lamb, without defect, as a
holocaust or a pigeon pigeon or a turtledove as a sacrifice for sin, as some
codices read, but, as we have stated: a dove pigeon or a turtledove as a
sacrifice for sin, then he adds: If you do not find enough to offer a Lamb, and
take two turtledoves. Here it seems that it remains and (it will take), because

said: Well, I was conceived in iniquities and in sin my mother raised me in the
womb (Ps. 50,7). Why then does Scripture say that it must be purified through
that sacrifice, not what was born, but what gives birth? Is it necessary to
relate perhaps the purification, because of the blood flow, with that from
which that origin came? Could it not be done without the purification of the
fetus itself, which was born of the same blood? For what does he say before:
For a son or a daughter he will offer a one-year-old Lamb, without blemish, as

like this: For a son or a daughter will offer a one-year-old Lamb, without defect,
as a holocaust, and a pigeon as a sacrifice for sin, but thus: And when the
days of purification are fulfilled by a son or a daughter. That is to say, that
the days of purification had been fulfilled by him or by her, by the son or by
the daughter. And then he would follow the text with the other meaning: He will
offer a one-year-old Lamb, without defect, as a holocaust, and a pigeon as a
sacrifice for sin, that is, for his sin, when the days of his purification are
fulfilled by his son or his daughter. Whoever believes that this separation
must be made will be refuted by the Gospel, because when the Lord of the Virgin
was born and they did something similar, more by the custom of the law than by
the need to expiate and purify some sin in it, the text says: When his parents
introduced the baby Jesus to do as prescribed by the law about him (Lc 2,27).
The text does not say "about his mother", but "about him",
although the present things were done in this place about the two turtledoves
or the two pigeon pigeons. For the Lord also deigned to be baptized like the
others with the baptism of John, which was a baptism of penance for the
forgiveness of sins, (Cf Mt 3,13.11) even though he had none. Therefore, some
of our translators also rightly translate the text of Leviticus in the
following way, not saying: about (super) the son or the daughter, but about
(pro) the son or the daughter. For they have thought that this was the value of
this preposition in the passage that occupies us and where the Greek says: ef
uio e epì zugatrí. It is necessary to notice, of course, with what poverty the
Lord wished to be born, that he did not offer himself a dove or pigeon or
turtledove, but a pair of doves or two pigeon pigeons, as we read in the Gospel
(Cf Lc 2,24). This is what the Levitical commanded then, saying: If the
offeror's hand did not have what it took to offer a Lamb (Lv 12,8).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

of leprosy on the skin of his color. The text then says, as an exposition, what
he had said before so that it could be understood. He had said this: If you had
a white scar on your skin. So that we do not think it refers to a scar, as is
usually the sign of a healed wound, it tells us that it refers to color when it
adds: And there would be a touch of leprosy on the skin of its color. Leaving
now what the author understands as a scar, it is a vice of color. With respect
to what is called the leprosy touch, it must be said that it is not about the
color being felt by touch, but that it is called a leprosy touch as if the
person or his body was touched by leprosy, it was stained or flawed It is as
they say: "The fever attacked him or he did not attack him." Finally,
it is called touch to the own stain and it is always designated as such. That
is why some of our translators have not translated "touch", but
"stain". Naturally, using this word, the text seems to have a clearer
meaning. But the Greek text may not have aften, that is, touch, but?, That is,
stain. Therefore, amomon means immaculate. Although Scripture does not usually
call amomon only to what refers to color, but to what is clean of all victo.

stain nor wrinkle (Eph. 5,27). But the author of Leviticus used neither momon
nor spílon, but afén, toque, word that even in the Greek language is little
used for the colors and, nevertheless, the Seventies had no difficulty in using
it. Why should Latin translators have it? As for the phrase: Scar of a signal,
or it is so called because it means something, or rather because it
distinguishes the person from the others by a signal, because it makes it
striking.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

stain" is equivalent to "declare it stained". "And"

that the text advises that, when the white color has been seen alone and
bright, different from the healthy color, the priest examines it again to
declare that it is leprosy, that is, that it smears the man declaring him a
leper, but only if it is checked that also the hair has turned white and the

not spread across the skin - that is, it has no different color or is different
from the skin. Then he has healed what was sick.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

color as the healthy color - the touch has not spread through the skin - as it
was said a little above, that is, it is not different of the rest of the skin -
and the priest will purify it (Lv 13, 4.5.6), that is, he will declare that he
is free from the suspicion of leprosy; not because he had leprosy, which he no

color of the touch, of the stain that had appeared, when he hoped that the
place had sunk more and the hair of that one The place had turned white, it did
not happen that way, but the touch, which had previously been bright and white,
became rather dark, similar to the rest of the color of the skin, not shiny.
Therefore, it was not leprosy. What appeared is a sign, it is not leprosy.
However, even though he is free from the suspicion of leprosy, he will
"wash his clothes," because in that sign there was also something

what had been healthy after the first seven days did not remain in his state,
but was changed to evil first, it is declared as it is leprosy. It is no longer
expected in this case, or that the place is more sunken or that the hair has
turned white. Since leprosy is not striking or vicious, but only its change,
the fact of moving from diseased to healthy color and returning from healthy
color to diseased color is so striking that in this case we would not have to
wait for what in the first case had been ordered to wait for the place of the
skin that was more sunken and the whiteness of the hair. For the mere fact of
the change there would be no doubt that it would be leprosy.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

priest, and the priest will examine him, and if there was a white scar on the
skin, and this changed the hair making it white and from the healthyness of the
living flesh there would be changed in the scar. If we remove the
"and" (from the last sentence) of the previous text, put there
according to the way of expressing oneself in the Scriptures, we have the
following meaning: The priest will examine it, and if there is a white scar on
the skin and this changed the hair making it white from the healthiness of the
living flesh in the scar. The order is: He changed the white hair in the scar
from the health of the living flesh, that is, as the living and healthy flesh
has dark and black hair, so this scar has white. And it continues: A rooted
leprosy is in the skin of its color; and the priest shall stain him-he shall
pronounce him stained-he will not separate him, since he is unclean. The text
seems to mean that when hair is changed in white with the same color as white
hair due to skin disease, it is no longer necessary to separate the patient to
examine him, nor do we have to wait until the place of the skin is more sunken.
Due to the fact that the skin is white, of a different color than the rest and
that it has white hair, of a different color than the rest of the living and
healthy flesh, it is declared that there is a rooted leprosy. It is rooted leprosy,
because you no longer have to examine it during those fourteen days. And it
continues: But if the healthy color were restored and it became white. This is
said because it had been said that all the white color spread all over the skin
was already pure for this same reason, since there would have been no change
there. And he continues: But at any time when he sees a bright color in him, he
will be stained (Lv 13,11). Here it is clear that the change is disapproved.
And therefore, in relation to what has just been said: But if the healthy color
were restored and turned white, and it will come to the priest, and the priest
will examine it and if the touch has turned white, and the priest will purify
the affected: it is pure (Lv 13,16.4), we should not believe that the healthy
color was restored so that healthy color would result; because it was already
the color by which it became impure because of the change. Thus, he says that
his healthy color was restored so that it was what it had been, that is, white
color, once the healthy color was lost. In this case it will be pure again,
having been all white, because there will be no change there. But to understand
"restored" as "lost" is something unusual. It seems that it
should rather have said: But if the white color had been restored. Now, on the
other hand, he says: if the healthy color had been restored and he had turned
white, as if he wanted to say: if the healthy color had been restored by
turning white.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

understood that it will make atonement for the saints from the impurities of

impurities of the children of Israel, who do not consent to their impurities;
not because the expiation had to be made only for them, but because it had to
be done for them, but that no one should believe that they were so holy, that
there was nothing in them for which the expiation should be made, even if they
were oblivious to the impurities of the children of Israel and their

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The meaning
of the phrase: He will make atonement for the saints of the impurities of the
children of Israel, it can also be this: it is a question of making atonement
for them, so that they will be protected from the impurities of the children of
Israel . But it will make the atonement can not be taken in any other sense
than in the one that means the verb will make propitious. That is why it is
also called a propitiatory to what others translate as an expiatory offering,
which in Greek is called ilastérion. And what the Latin author translates in
this passage: he will make expiation (exorabit) for the saints, corresponds to
the Greek exilásetai, which only applies to sins. That is why it is said in the
psalm: That it is propitious in all your iniquities (Ps. 102,3). According to
this, the most accurate sense of the passage is to think that the priest also
makes God propitious in favor of those who are holy, free from the impurities
of the children of Israel, and that, even if they are so holy that they do not
consent to the impurities of the children of Israel and in the injustices,
nevertheless, they have something for which it is necessary to have God
propitious.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But in a
Greek text we find: And he will make atonement for the saint, not for the
saints, and the word "holy" is certainly in the neuter gender
(sanctum), which corresponds to the Greek tò agion. In effect, it could be
understood: He will make atonement to the holy God, and there would be no
problem. But it would be difficult to say how it could be understood: for the
atonement to this holy, unless it is understood that which is holy, whatever it
may be, which is God, because it is also Holy Spirit, which is certainly God.
In Greek it is said, in neutral gender, tò pneuma tò agion. And perhaps - if
that codex that seemed more correct is truer - the phrase exilásetai tò agion
would be equivalent to tò pneuma tò agion, which in Latin can not be said in
neutral gender. In spite of everything, in three other codices, one Greek and
two Latin, we have only found what we said before, that is: He will make
atonement for the saints, and this phrase can also be interpreted in the sense
that it does not refer to the holy men, but to holy things, such as the
tabernacle and anything else that was consecrated to the Lord in those holy
things. The meaning of the phrase: He will make atonement for the saints to
free them from the impurities of the children of Israel, it would be: He will
make God propitiate to the things consecrated to the Lord, freeing them from
the impurities of the children of Israel, because the tabernacle was in the
midst of them. For the text goes on like this: after saying: He will make
atonement for the saints of the impurities of the children of Israel and the
injustices of all their sins, immediately adds: The same will do with the
tabernacle of the testimony, which has been made between they, in the midst of
their impurities (Lv 16,16). Thus, that appropriation for holy things seems
necessary for the tabernacle and for all the things that are called holy in it.
For a little later it is said, about the altar, that the priest should purify
it with the sprinkling of blood and sanctify it by freeing it from the
impurities of the children of Israel.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

that had to be sent to the desert, called by the Greeks apopompaion, there is
usually discussion, and some say that the one that should be immolated must be
interpreted in a good way, and the that had to be sent to the desert must be
interpreted in the bad. But this interpretation can not be sustained, precisely
because when the man who brought the goat with his hand to the desert returns,
he is ordered to wash his clothes and his body with water and thus enter the
camp (</span><span lang="ES" style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Cf Lv 16,26</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">)
as if this were also an indication for interpreting in a bad sense the matter
of the goat, from whose contagion man had to be cleansed; but it is also said
that those who take the flesh of the other goat and the bull and wash them
outside the camp must be washed, because it is commanded that this be done with
the goat and the bull, and that once immolated it is done sprinkling with their
blood (Cf Lv 9,8-12) and offering both as a sacrifice for sins. And for that
reason, the distinction between these two goats must be considered carefully
from the allegorical meaning. Similarly, when the tenth day of the seventh
month is established as Saturday of Saturdays (Cf Lv 16,29-32) so that the one
priest who succeeds his father would do the purification mentioned above, the
Scripture says, when speaking of that priest: He will make atonement for the
saint of holy. And I do not know if the phrase should be interpreted in any
other way than this one: "He will make atonement in the saint's
saint", thinking that it is a way of expressing himself. He will do it,
then, in that holy place where only the high priest entered, a place that was
beyond the veil, where was the ark of the covenant and the altar of incense.
Naturally, he will not make the atonement of that place as if it were God, but
he will make the atonement there to God, that is why it is said: He will make
atonement for the saint of the saint. In Greek, this phrase is also placed in
neutral gender: tò agion tou agíou. Or is it perhaps the Holy Spirit of the
holy God, that is to say: tò agion pneuma tou agíou zeou? Or will "make
atonement" not be rather "making atonement purify"? Because the
words are united like this: And he will make atonement for the saint of the
saint and for the tabernacle of the testimony and will make atonement for the
altar and make atonement for the priests and for the whole assembly (Lv 16,33).
And how will he make the atonement to the tabernacle and altar more than, as we
have said, interpreting the word thus: "making the purification
purify"?</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

inside the camp and who kills them outside the camp and does not take them to
the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony. In what has just been said
there is a sin and a punishment is threatened to whoever does it. And it does
not refer to animals that are killed for food or for similar things, but to
offer them in sacrifice. Private sacrifices are therefore forbidden, so that no
one dares to be a priest in any way for himself, but to bring the victims where
they are offered to God through the priest. In this way they will avoid making
sacrifices to the vanities, since this has also been tried to be avoided with
that custom. Therefore, since it was not lawful to offer sacrifices except in
the tabernacle to which the temple later happened - therefore, the king of
Israel, Jeroboam even dared to make two calves for the people to offer
sacrifices to them, so that, moved by the necessity of this law, were not
seduced by the temple those who belonged to his kingdom, while they went to
Jerusalem to offer their sacrifices in the temple of God, and in this action
was condemned by the Lord (Cf 1R 12,28-30), we can ask with all reason why
Elijah could have offered sacrifices lawfully outside the temple of God, when
he not only impelled fire from heaven, but he overcame the prophets of demons (Cf
1R 18,36-39). It seems to me that it does not defend itself with any reason
other than that with which it also defends the action of Abraham with which it
intended to sacrifice his son by order of God (Cf Gn 22,3-10). Because when the
one who makes the law commands to do something that has been prohibited in the
law itself, the mandate itself is considered law, because it is proper to the
author of the law. Besides the sacrifice, other miracles could not be missed by
means of which the prophets of the sacred forests would be overcome and
defeated. But the spirit of God, which had been in Elijah with respect to
everything he did in this matter, can not go against the law, since he is the giver
of the law.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

soul of all flesh is its blood? The entire passage explains it this way: If any
man of the children of Israel or any of the proselytes living among you eats
any blood, I will put my face on the soul that eats blood and exterminate it
from its people. For the soul of all flesh is its blood. And I gave it to you
to make atonement for your souls; for his blood will serve as expiation for the
soul. That is why I said to the children of Israel: "No one among you will
eat blood; nor the proselyte who lives among you will eat blood. " If we
say that blood is the soul of an animal, must we also admit that blood is the
soul of man? No way. Then, why does not the text say: The soul of all flesh of
an animal is its blood, but says: The soul of all flesh is its blood? It is
evident that the word "of all flesh" also includes the flesh of man.
But, since there is something vital in the blood, because through it one lives,
especially in the actual flesh, and the blood is diffused through the whole
body through all the veins, is it perhaps called soul to the own body life, not
the life that comes out of the body, but the life that ends with death? With
this expression we say that this life is temporary, not eternal; mortal, not
immortal, being immortal the nature of the soul, which is taken by the angels
from the bosom of Abraham, and to which it is said: Today you will be with me
in paradise (Lc 23,43), and that it burned in the torments of hell (Cf Lc 16,23).
According to this meaning for which we also call this temporary life a soul,
the Apostle said the following: For I do not consider my soul valuable to me (Acts
20,24). Here he wants to show that he was willing even to die for the Gospel.
Because, according to the meaning by which the soul is called what comes out of
the body, the Apostle made it all the more valuable the greater merit it gained
him. There are other expressions similar to these. Thus, this temporal life is
contained mostly in the body by blood. But what do these words mean: I have
given it to you next to the altar of God, to make atonement for your soul? (Lv
17,11) It is as if the soul made atonement for the soul. Does blood atonement
for blood perhaps, as if we had to be preoccupied with our blood when we want
to make atonement for our soul? This is an absurdity.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But it is
much more absurd for the blood of an animal to make atonement for the soul of
man, which can not die, when the Scripture expressly says in the Epistle to the
Hebrews that the blood of the victims was of no avail to make atonement God for
the sins of men, but it had meant something that would benefit. The text reads
as follows: For it is impossible for the blood of goats and bulls to remove
sins (Hb 10,4). Now, since for our soul makes the atonement that mediator was
prefigured by all those sacrifices offered for sins, it is clear that soul is
what is meant by the soul.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

And the seven cows are seven years (Gn 41,46), and many other similar examples.
According to this, it is said: And the stone was Christ (1Co 10,4). It is not
said: The stone meant Christ, but it is said as if it were this that evidently
was not by essence, but by the meaning. So also the blood, since it means the
soul, by a certain vital matter, is called soul mysteriously. In case anyone
thinks that the soul of an animal is blood, there is no reason to argue about
this matter. One should only carefully avoid thinking that the soul of man, who
gives life to human flesh and is rational, is considered blood. This error must
be refuted by all means. On the other hand, we have to look for expressions in
which content means the continent. Thus, for example, as the soul is contained
in the body by the blood - because if the blood spills, it leaves the body -
the soul is better signified by the blood, and the blood receives its name from
it. Thus, the church is called the place where the church meets, for men are
the church, of whom it is said: and presenting it as a glorious church. But
with this same name the house of prayer is designated. And this is witnessed by
the Apostle himself, when he says: Do you not have houses to eat and drink? Do
you despise the church of God? (1Co 11,22) The daily use of speaking has kept
it from saying: Go to church or flee to church more than from one who has gone
or fled to that place and its walls on which the congregation of the church is
enclosed. It is also written: Blood is shed who removes the wages of the day
laborer (Si 31 34,27). Here blood is called wages, because wages sustain life,
which is called blood.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

Lord says: If you do not eat my flesh and you do not drink my blood, you will
not have life in you (Jn 6,53), what does it mean that the people are forbidden
so insistently to take the blood of the sacrifices offered for sins, if with
those sacrifices? Was this unique sacrifice meant to reach the true remission
of sins? Well, not only is no one forbidden to take the blood of this sacrifice
as food, but it is even exhorted to all who want to have life to drink it. It
is necessary to investigate, therefore, what it means that in the law man is
forbidden to eat the blood and be ordered to pour it out for God. Because,
about the nature of the soul, because it is signified by the blood, we have
already said what we thought convenient.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

The one born outside the home is understood as the mother's daughter, if
perhaps the mother had had it from a previous husband and had come with her
home when she married her father. The Scripture advises not to discover the
nakedness of his sister. Here seems not to have forbidden, and almost
overlooked, the concubus with the sister born of both parents. Because the text
does not say: You will not discover the nakedness of your sister, daughter of
your father and mother, but of your father or your mother. But who does not see
that also that is forbidden with much more reason? Because if it is not lawful
to discover the nakedness of a sister, daughter of either of the two parents,
how much less the daughter of both! Why does it also prohibit concubinage with
one's nieces, saying about the son or about the daughter: You will not discover
the nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife (Lv 18,11). If what had
been said had stopped here, we would understand that the concubinage with the
stepmother's daughter, born by her from a previous husband and not the sister
of the individual who is forbidden, whether daughter of the father, would also
have been forbidden. , whether daughter of the mother. But when adding:

nakedness, (Lv 18,11) it is shown that this prohibition was made because of the
sister, since she had been the daughter of the father and the stepmother, of
whom we had already spoken before. Or the author wanted to prohibit it again
more clearly, because before it was very dark? The Scripture does this many
times.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

brother's nakedness. We wonder if this is forbidden, living the brother or when
he has already died, and the problem is not small. For if we were to say that
the Scripture has spoken of the wife of the living brother, resorting to a
general precept, which forbids a man to approach his neighbor's wife, obviously
this would also be understood (Cf Ex 20,17). Why then distinguish in a very
careful way with particular prohibitions these people, calling domestic, from
the others? Because what it prohibits about the woman of the father, that is to
say, of the stepmother, refers to while the father lives and not when he has
already died. Well, if the father lives, who does not see that it is much more
forbidden, if the wife of any other man is forbidden to be stained with
adultery? Therefore, it seems that it refers to those people who, not having
husbands, could join in marriage if it were not forbidden by law, as it is said
to be the custom among the Persians. But then, if we understood that, when the
brother was dead, it was forbidden to marry the wife of the brother, we are
presented with the precept that the Scripture imposes when it comes to leaving
offspring to a dead brother without children (Cf Dt 25,5). And therefore,
compared this prohibition with that mandate, so that there is no contradiction
between them, we must think that there is an exception, that is, it is not
lawful for anyone to marry the wife of a deceased brother, if the dead left
offspring . Or that this would be forbidden, so that it would not be lawful to
marry the brother's wife even if she had separated by repudiation of the living
brother. Because then, as the Lord says, Moses, because of the hardness of the
Jews, would have allowed them to give the libel of repudiation (Cf Mt 19,8).
And because of this dismissal it could be thought that anyone could marry
lawfully with his brother's wife, when he did not fear adultery, since he would
have separated from her by repudiation.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

The text also prohibits marrying the woman's granddaughter, the daughter of a

jealous. Here it is not forbidden to marry more than one woman, which was
allowed to the ancients to increase offspring. But it is forbidden to marry two
sisters. This seems to have been done by Jacob (Cf Gn 30,22-28), either because
he was not yet forbidden by law or because he was deceived, by giving him
another woman to replace what he wanted, and what he got later, he liked her
more. But it was unfair to dispatch the first one, so as not to put her in
danger of committing adultery. The final sentence: to produce jealousy, has it
been set so that there is no jealousy among the sisters, since the zeal that
existed among those who were not sisters had to be despised? Or has it been put
rather so that it is not done for this, that is, so that the marriage with two

same precepts with which it was banned (Cf Lv 15,19-27) already enough, above?
As this was said before, so as not to believe that it had to be taken
figuratively, has he also put it here, where these things are forbidden, that,
once the observation of the ancient shadows has been abolished, to observe them
also without doubt in the time of the New Testament? The Scripture seems to have
indicated this also through the prophet Ezekiel, who also mentions the sin of
approaching a woman during menstruation between sins that are clearly of
iniquity, not symbols of something. And among the merits of justice the prophet
does not approach such a woman (Cf Ez 18,6; 22,10). In this matter, nature is

Latin translators usually do not translate except by serving (serving). But the
meaning of both words is very different. Because the Scripture does not
prohibit serving men as slaves do, which is not latreíein, but duleíein. But,
according to the meaning of the verse, it is not commanded to serve men, but to
the one and true God, as it is written: The Lord your God you will worship and
he will only serve (Dt 6,13). But not only with the word latreíein? it is
sufficiently indicated who is called prince, that is, who is worshiped as God,
but also appears with what comes next: And you will not profane the holy name.
Or it is the name of God, whose people can thus serve the prince, or the holy
name of the own people of Israel. And that is why it is said: You are holy,

theft appeared in the Decalogue (Cf Ex 20,14). As for what follows: You will
not lie or slander your neighbor, it would be strange if you did not lock
yourself in that precept that appears there: You will not say false testimony
against your neighbor (Ex 20,16), because there can not be a slander without a
lie, something that contains in the general statement about the false
testimony. But there is a serious problem about whether these things can be
admitted in any case. With regard to the lie, as it seems to almost everyone
that a lie can be said to save one when no one is harmed, is it possible to
affirm the same about theft? Can a theft be committed when no one is harmed? On
the contrary, it can be done even when one looks at the one who is being
robbed, as is the case when one steals the sword of a man who wants to kill
himself. Actually, the slander I do not know if one could be made to his
advantage. When Joseph slandered his brothers about the glass and charged them
with the false accusation that they were spies, perhaps he did it to achieve
greater joy, which they would later enjoy. Although if we tried to determine
these things with appropriate definitions, perhaps there is no theft more than
when harm is done to others, hiding what is foreign. And there is no slander
more than when harm is done to others, accusing them of false guilt. But we can
not say that lie exists only when harm is caused to our neighbor. When one says
a false thing knowingly, it is certainly a lie, whether it is harmed with it or
if no harm is done to anyone. Therefore, the serious problem about lying, that
is, if the lie could ever be lawful, would probably be solved easily if we
contemplated only the commandments, and not the examples. Because what is more
blunt than this commandment: You will not lie? It is stated as: You will not
make idols-which can never be lawful-and also what the Scripture says: You will
not commit adultery-who would dare to say that adultery could ever be lawful?
And the same as: You will not steal - according to that definition of theft the
theft can never be lawful. And: You will not kill (Ex 20,4.13.14.15), because
when a man is lawfully killed, the law kills him, not you. Can it be said that
when a man lies lawfully, does the law lie? The examples make the question very
difficult: the Egyptian midwives lied and God rewarded them with goods (Cf Ex
1,19.20). Rahab lied in favor of the spies of the country and for that reason
she was released (Cf Jos 2,4; 6,25 24). Is it from what is said in the law: You
will not lie, from where you have to understand the subject, and is it not
lawful to tell a lie in the circumstance in which Rahab said it? It is more
plausible to think that the lie was prohibited because it was unlawful that it
was not made illegal because it was forbidden. So perhaps, as we said about the
midwives, they were not rewarded because they told a lie, but they were
rewarded for freeing the Hebrew children, in such a way that this mercy would
have made that sin venial, but we could not stop thinking that it was sin.
About Rahab we must also think that he was awarded the release of the spies, in
such a way that the lie was forgiven for having granted them freedom. Well,
where forgiveness is granted is that there has been a sin. We must avoid,
however, thinking that forgiveness can also be granted to other sins if they
are committed to free men. Because of this error would be followed many
intolerable and absolutely detestable evils.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

to these words of Scripture: You will not harm your neighbor. What follows
next: You will not deprive him, if he does not refer to the fact of not doing

perhaps "and is not punished"? Because, when you impose a punishment
on your neighbor who commits a sin, you do it with good intentions, so as not
to bear your sin through negligence. This is what has been said before: You
will not hate your brother in your spirit. Because who is corrected, it might
seem that you hate him, when in fact that is not your intention. The phrase: Do
not take your hand, does it mean perhaps that you do not have to avenge your

clothes and will not approach any dead soul. It is understood that he is
forbidden to do what was previously said about mourning, that is, to discover
the head, removing the miter and tearing the garments. Tearing the garments was
a custom of the ancients when they mourned, as, for example, in the case of
Job, when his sons announced to him that ruin had come upon them (Cf Jb 1,20).
Discovering the head, taking off the miter, could be a gesture of mourning
precisely because it was taking off an ornament. In relation to the phrase: And
it will not come close to any dead soul, it is difficult to understand how the
dead body is called dead soul. But it must be said that this is a frequent
expression in the Scriptures that for us is very rare. In effect, the private
body of the soul also receives the name of the one who governed it, because it
must be returned in the resurrection. As, for example, the building that is
called church, is still called church, although the church, which are men, has
left there. But since the body does not receive the name of soul in a living
man, we are surprised that it is called a soul when it lacks a soul. Now, if we
understand that it is the dead soul, separated from the body, so that it would
seem that death was the separation itself, that is, that the dead soul had been
stripped from the body without losing its nature -for not even when it is said
that we are dead to sin (Cf Rm 6,2), it is affirmed that nature has perished,
but that we no longer sin, so that it is understood that the soul is dead, dead
to the body, because it has ceased to use it, since it lives in its nature -
how can one approach a dead soul, something that was forbidden to this priest,
since whoever approaches, approaches a dead body, not a soul that has separated
from the body? Or is it designated by the name of soul to one's own temporal
life, which is certainly dead in a dead body, since that soul migrated that can
not die? It is not a matter of the soul having been its own life, but because
of the presence of the soul, which gave it subsistence, it has received its
name. It is something similar to the distinction we made when speaking about
blood, about which it was said: The soul of all flesh is blood (Lv 17,11).
Because the blood is dead in a dead body, and it does not withdraw with the
soul that withdraws. The Scripture therefore forbade the high priest to even
approach the corpse of his own father or mother. Thing that did not forbid the
priest of the second degree, because he continues saying: Neither by his father
nor by his mother he will become impure (Lv 21,11). The order of the words is
as follows: By his father he will not be made unclean by his mother.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

funerals were celebrated by his family, as he was also forbidden to leave the
saints during the seven days in which he was consecrated, but not forever. If
the high priests were not forbidden, certainly, then marry or have children,
there is a serious problem. For as the law says that a man is impure until the
evening even by conjugal intercourse, even if he laves his body with water, (Cf
Lv 8,33) and the high priest is commanded to go twice a day every day to the
other side of the veil, there was the altar of incense, so that the incense may
continue to burn always, and it is said that no impure person was allowed to
approach the saint, how could the high priest fulfill this daily, if he begot
children? Because if one asked who would supply him in the event that he fell
ill, one can reply saying that because of God's favor he did not fall ill. Can
the same be said about the procreation of children? From here it follows, or
that it would keep the continence, or that for a few days the incense was
interrupted, or, if it could not be interrupted, that which only the high
priest could perform, then he would not become impure by conjugal intercourse
on account of his special state of holiness. Or if he also refers to what is
said below about all the sons of Aaron, that none of them should approach the
saint if any impurity befalls him (Cf Lv 21,17), it is as a solution to think
that some days he did not put incense.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><br /></span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

approaching the body of his father, he may wonder how he could already be a
high priest if his father had not yet died, when the Scripture orders the high
priests to succeed their parents. Because the incense, which had to be placed
daily by the high priest, was always on, it was necessary that the priest be
immediately replaced, even though the previous high priest was not buried.
Although the question of the illness of the high priest still remains, if we
think he could be sick a few days before dying. Unless this is also resolved by
saying that the chief priests used to die suddenly, without pre-dating an
illness, as the Scripture says about Aaron (Cf Nm 20,26-29).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

Lord, who sanctified him, speaking of the high priest, and that this same thing
is said to Moses: And you shall sanctify him. How does Moses and the Lord
sanctify? Moses does not do it for the Lord, but for his ministry, through
visible rites. The Lord does it by his Holy Spirit, through his invisible
grace, in whom all the fruit of his own visible rites resides. Because what are
the visible rites taking advantage of without this sanctification of invisible
grace? We can rightly ask if this invisible sanctification, without visible
rites, for which man is visibly sanctified, does not serve equally for
anything, which is naturally an absurdity. Because someone more acceptably
would say that without them it would not exist, rather than saying that it
would not take advantage if it existed, when in sanctification all the
usefulness of the rites resides. But we must also see how it can be said
correctly that without the rites, holiness could not exist. Because, in effect,
the visible baptism of Simon Magus who lacked invisible sanctity was of no use
to him (Cf Acts 8,9). But those to whom he took advantage of this invisible
sanctification, because they had it, had also received the visible rites, for
they had been baptized just as he was. With regard to Moses, who visibly
sanctified the priests, it is not said where he himself was sanctified by the
same sacrifices or by the oil. But who would dare to deny that he was
sanctified invisibly, he who stood out for such great grace? The same can also
be said of John the Baptist, since he appeared earlier as a baptizer than as a
baptized one (Cf Mt 3,11.14). Therefore we can not deny at all that he too was
sanctified. But nowhere do we find that this has been done with him in a
visible way before he himself came to the ministry of baptism. The same can be
said of that thief whom the Lord told him when he was crucified with him: Today
you will be with me in paradise (Lc 23,43). Because this man could not receive
the gift of such great happiness without invisible sanctification. Therefore,
we must conclude that some had and took advantage of invisible sanctification
without visible rites, which were changing over time, so that before they were
some and now they are others. But the visible sanctification that would be
verified by the visible rites, could exist without this invisible
sanctification, but it could not be profitable. However, this is not the reason
why we should despise the visible rite. For he who despises him can not be
sanctified invisibly. From this it is deduced that Cornelius and those who were
with him, although they were already sanctified invisibly by the coming of the
Holy Spirit, nevertheless, were baptized (Cf Hch 10,44-48). And this visible
sanctification was not deemed superfluous, even though it had already preceded
invisible sanctification.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

take care of the saints of the children of Israel; they will not profane my
holy name with the many things that they consecrate to me; I, the Lord ». And
you will say to them: "Any man, whoever is of all your descendants, in
your generations, who comes near to the holy things that consecrate the Lord
the children of Israel and impurity in him, that soul will be exterminated from
my presence, I , the Lord your God ». Disappearance, then, all doubt that no
priest, or the high priests or the second rank, could approach the holy things
having some impurity. The priest was required to have continence, lest the
incense be continued for some days by the procreation of the children. The
incense used to put it twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon (Cf Ex
30,7.8). And only the high priests did it. And continence was demanded of them,
because after the conjugal intercourse, even if the priest washed his body, he
remained impure until the evening (Cf Lv 15,16), and it was he who had to put
the incense. The phrase: "The things consecrated by the children of
Israel" means that the faithful offered them to the priests so that they
could offer them to the Lord. And it is necessary to indicate the sort of
consecration, because it is done by a vote and by the devotion of the offeror.
But it is necessary to pay attention to whether it is also said in the Scriptures
that men consecrate themselves in this same way, when for some reason they
consecrate themselves by making a vow, as consecrated in this way are the
things Men offer.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

serious? Have you tried to show, perhaps, by repeating the same thing, that the

land that I am going to give you on the Lord's sabbaths has rested, six years
you shall sow your field and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather
its fruit; but the seventh year will be Saturday: the earth will have its rest,
Saturday for the Lord. How should we understand the phrase: When you have
entered the land that I am going to give you and the earth has rested,
"six years will you sow your field," etc.? It seems as if they had
been ordered to do that when the earth had rested, while the earth rests
precisely because this is done. For the text refers to the rest of the earth in
the seventh year, in which the Lord commanded that no one should work in it
through agriculture. But, evidently, the long hyperbaton makes the meaning of
the text obscure. It seems that the order of words would be as follows. When
you have entered the land that I am going to give you and the land that I am
going to give you has rested, it is the Sabbath of the Lord: you do not reap
things that come from your field by yourself, and the grape of your
sanctification does not you will harvest It will be the year of rest for the
earth. And the Sabbath of the earth will be food for you and for your servant
and your servant and for your hired servant and for your guest who resides with
you. Also for your cattle and for your animals that are in your land,
everything that springs from it will be eaten (Lv 25,5-7). To explain how the
earth rests, he interposed the following words: Six years you will sow your
field and six years you will prune your vineyard and gather its fruit; but the
seventh year will be a sabbath: the earth will have its rest, the Sabbath of
the Lord. You shall not sow your field and you shall not prune your vineyard.
By saying: You will not prune, we must understand that all agriculture is
prohibited that year. Because if you can not prune, you can not plow or hold
with stakes or use anything else that serves agriculture. Now, as the part is
usually taken for the whole, so also for the pruning all kinds of cultivation
are indicated. And when mentioning the field and the vineyard, as it was
forbidden to sow that field and prune this vineyard, we must understand that it
is all sorts of fields. Because it is clear that you can not work in an olive
grove or in any other field, which has not been mentioned. As for the phrase:
And the Sabbath of the earth will be food for you and for your servant and for
your servant, etc., it is clear that with it the owner of the field has not
been prohibited from feeding on what the earth spontaneously produces. year
without having been cultivated. But it is forbidden to collect the fruits. It
is allowed, then, to take something from there to eat, as in passing, taking
only what can be eaten immediately by eating it, not what is collected for use

that has body and soul. Neither its substance is like that of the creature,
which is called a soul, which he made, as the Lord himself attests through
Isaiah, saying: And I have done all the blowing (Is 57,16). What the text says
below shows that it is the soul of man. For as when God speaks of his eyes and
lips or quotes other words concerning the bodily members, we naturally do not
think that God is defined by a bodily form, but that all those terms referring
to the bodily members are only considered as effects of the actions and powers
of God; In the same way, when God speaks of his soul, we must understand that
it is his will. Indeed, that perfect and simple nature, which is called God,
does not consist of body and spirit, nor is it changeable by the spirit itself
as the soul is. But God is also spirit, and he is always the same, he in whom
there is no change. From here the apolinarians drew their argument to say that
man, Christ Jesus (Cf 1Tm 2,5), mediator between God and men, had no soul, but
was only Word and flesh, in saying those words: My soul is sad until death (Mt

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">According to blessed Bede,<b><sup>1</sup></b> the Apocalypse consists of
seven sections. In the first, after a salutation, the author mentions the
sufferings and glories of the Lord in order to encourage the weak; then, after
mentioning the things that have been done and must be done in the seven churches,
he describes the fights and victories of the universal Church. In the second,
he sees four beasts, twenty-four ancients, the Lamb standing, and a book sealed
with seven seals; he also recounts fights and triumphs of the Church. In the
third, under the appearance of seven angels sounding trumpets, he describes
various events in the Church. In the fourth, under the symbol of a woman and a
dragon, he recounts the fights and victories of the Church, and here he relates
the things said and done by the seven angels, although not in the same way as
previously. In the fifth, he strikes the earth with seven plagues through the
seven angels. In the sixth, he recounts the damnation of the harlot. In the
seventh, he says that the wife of the Lamb comes down adorned from heaven.
About the seven rules of Tychonius, the first of which is concerning the Lord
and his body, the second is concerning the true and simulated body of the Lord,
the third is concerning the promises and the law, the fourth is concerning
species and genus, the fifth is concerning times, the sixth is recapitulation,
the seventh is concerning the Devil and his body, these seven rules are found
not only in the Apocalypse but also in other books, though especially in the
prophetic ones.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt"> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The first one to comment on the Apocalypse
was martyr Victorinus. Following him, blessed Jerome, removing some things the
former had interpreted literally and adding a few things of his own, composed
one book on it, promising that working on the Apocalypse would be his priority
if he lived long enough; but it is uncertain whether that work was completed.
The Donatist Tychonius also published a manifold exposition on it, but he
mingled it with the poison of perfidy. After him, Primasius, bishop of the
African church, a man in all respects Catholic and learned in the divine Scriptures,
explained it in five books, in which, as he himself affirms, he did not so much
write his own ideas as those of others, selecting what the same Tychonius had
interpreted correctly, but also adding a few chapters exposed by blessed
Augustine. Although he explained the Apocalypse more fully than others did, he
nonetheless composed his work in a very elevated language. Then, a few chapters
(few in number, but treated in a most exquisite manner) were explained by Saint
Gregory throughout his various works. Lastly, the blessed priest Ambrose Autpert
very beautifully analyzed some of these writings, adding however many things of
his own.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is he that reads and they that hear the words of the prophecy of this book</i>,<b><sup>1</sup></b> etc. Therefore, since it
is a new prophecy, it surpasses the old prophecy in the same way as the Gospel
surpasses the observance of the law, because the things that the old prophecy
foretold as needing to be revealed concerning Christ and the Church, this
prophecy announces as already revealed. This is also why it is titled “Apocalypse,”
that is “Revelation.” Moreover, this book's authority is great, because it was
sent to John by the Trinity through an angel: by the Father, as it is said in <i>which God gave unto him, to make known</i>;<b><sup>2</sup></b> by the Son, as it is said
in <i>I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify
to you</i>,<b><sup>3</sup></b> and also by
the Holy Spirit, as it is said in <i>the
Lord God Omnipotent spirit of the prophets sent his angel</i>,<b><sup>4</sup></b> etc. Then, it is
demonstrated that the words of the Apocalypse themselves teach us that nothing
in it has a historical<b><sup>5</sup></b>
meaning; for neither are there in heaven smiths to forge breastplates, nor
could a woman have given birth in heaven. Now it remains for us to discuss the
nature of the vision. So, our fathers taught us that we should understand three
kinds of visions: a physical one, as when we see the sun, the moon, and the
rest through our eyes; a spiritual one, which happens through ecstasy to men
either sleeping or awake, when they behold in spirit not physical things, but
likenesses of physical things, as Pharaoh saw the seven cows,<b><sup>6</sup></b> Nebuchadnezzar the stone
cut out of a mountain without hands,<b><sup>7</sup></b>
and Peter the linen sheet.<b><sup>8</sup></b>
The third kind of vision is the one called intellectual, in which it is neither
physical things nor likenesses of them that are manifested to the beholders,
but the very truth of things; which blessed Jerome ascribes only to this
Apocalypse. Saint Augustine,<b><sup>9</sup></b>
on the other hand, tells us in every possible way that we must understand in it
a spiritual vision exposed to view through likenesses of physical things; but
let them see for themselves who of them was closer to the truth. The
arrangement of the narration is as follows: sometimes he begins with the Lord's
coming and leads us all the way to the end of the world; sometimes he begins
with the Lord's coming, and, before ending, he goes back to the beginning and
runs over things he had omitted, or things he had already said, repeating them
with different symbols, thus until the second coming of the Lord; sometimes he
starts with the last persecution, but, before he reaches the end, he
recapitulates and joins both narrations together; sometimes he interrupts for a
little while the narration undertaken and interposes something else that does
not concern it, and after this break in the order he finishes to teach the
things he had started to; sometimes, in his very way of speaking, he changes a
figure in such a way that he somehow intermingles other things, so that it
comes to mean something rather different from what he had started to say. Note
moreover that in this revelation both the angel and John very rarely keep their
own roles. The speech reverts from species to genus, as when he added, after
rebuking Jezebel specifically, <i>and I will
give to every one of you according to your works</i>,<b><sup>10</sup></b> which seems to be able to refer generally to either
the good or the wicked. Likewise, it passes from genus to species, as when,
while he was saying, under the species of the bishop of the Pergamenians, to
the church, which lives among wicked people, <i>I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is</i>,<b><sup>11</sup></b> etc., he says right after
that against the negligent bishop, <i>I have
against thee a few things</i>,<b><sup>12</sup></b>
etc. From this species it passes to another when he adds immediately after
that, <i>so hast thou also them that hold
the doctrine of the Nicolaites</i>:<b><sup>13</sup></b>
for as he says not “thou hast there also” but “so hast<i> thou also</i>”, he is obviously hinting that he is turning his speech
from one species to another. You can also find a genus in a species: for in
saying <i>I John, your brother, </i>etc.,<b><sup>14</sup></b> he proclaims in his own
person the persecutions of the whole Church which it suffers every day for the
Word of God. It also happens for genus to be joined to genus, when a throne is
said to be set in heaven:<b><sup>15</sup></b>
for both of these, i.e. both heaven and the throne, mentioned on their own,
frequently signify the Church in this revelation, and when they are joined
together, they symbolize one and the same Church.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The Apocalypse of Jesus Christ.</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt"> First, it is to be noted that the meaning would be
expressed more fully if he said “<i>this is</i>
the Apocalypse;” but it is a habit of the Scriptures to leave those little
words implied for brevity's sake. This is why Solomon did not say “these are
the parables of Solomon”<b><sup>1</sup></b>
or “these are the words of Ecclesiastes.”<b><sup>2</sup></b>
<b>Apocalypse</b>, as already said, comes
from the Greek for “revelation.” <b>Jesus</b>
in Hebrew translates to <i>soter</i> in
Greek and <i>salutaris</i><b><sup>3</sup></b> in Latin. <b>Christ</b> comes from the Greek for “anointed”;
for <i>chrisma</i> means “unction”. It is
told in the book of Exodus<b><sup>4 </sup></b>that
Moses was the first to prepare <i>chrisma</i>
at the Lord's bidding, with which kings and priests used to be anointed,
prefiguring Christ invisibly anointed by the Father. <b>Which God gave unto him, to make known to his servants the things which
must shortly come to pass.</b> Here also it is to be noted that “‘by’ which God
gave unto him” would be a more usual way of saying it; but it is a habit of the
sacred Scripture frequently to put the accusative instead of the ablative
without preposition<b><sup>5</sup></b>.
Whence this in a psalm: <i>Hear, O Lord, my
voice, which I have cried to thee,</i><b><sup>6</sup></b>
and Paul: <i>I have fought a good fight.</i><b><sup>7</sup></b> Indeed what is shown by
these words is that this revelation is that of Jesus Christ, and that he
received from God the task to make known to his servants by his revelation the
things which must shortly come to pass. This is why it is necessary to mark it
thus: <b>the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ</b>,
and then to introduce, <b>which God gave
unto him, to make known to his servants, </b>etc., the former referring to his
divinity, according to which he reveals all the mysteries with the Father; the
latter referring to his humanity, according to which he received not only from
the Father and the Holy Spirit, but also from himself, the task to manifest <b>to his servants</b> by his revelation <b>the things which must shortly come to pass</b>.
Whence it is not said, “which God ‘the Father’ gave unto him,” but,
indeterminately, <b>which God</b>, that is
the Trinity, <b>gave unto him</b>. Note
also that in saying <b>to his servants</b>,
he also shows the Son in the form of a servant, but not a servant, as his
humanity is proclaimed master of the servants. He says <b>his</b>, which means “subject to divine grace”, according to this: <i>I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, because thou hast hidden these </i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

This is about the grammatical construction of the Latin. The accusative is the
form of a word (noun, pronoun, or adjective) used for the direct object (or
internal object, but I will not enter into too much detail for this is not
supposed to be a grammar book!) of a verb, as <i>quam</i>, « which », is the direct object of dedit, « gave »,<i> in quam dedit illi Deus palam facere servis
suis, quae oportet fieri cito</i>,<span>  </span>«
which God gave unto him, to make known to his servants the things which must
shortly come to pass. » The ablative without preposition is used, among other
things, to denote an instrument or means by which something is done, as <i>qua</i>, « with which/by (means of) which »,
in the phrasing the author suggests would have been more usual: <i>qua dedit illi Deus</i>, « with which/by
(means of) which God gave unto him ». The author was interpreting the
Apocalypse as a means by which God gave unto John to make known to his servants
the things that must shortly come to pass, rather than as something God gave
unto him in order to make those things known, and so thought the ablative would
have been more usual to express the idea. His interpretation seems however
erroneous.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

2 Tim. 4:7. Latin could have used the ablative here, so as to say literally

afterwards, <b>the things which must shortly
come to pass</b>, although one could understand countless things by it, his
particular intention was nonetheless to speak of the Church's temporal
afflictions and everlasting joys to come, and of the wicked's present happiness
and future eternal torments. These things all come to pass shortly, because
this present time is forced to fly by until the end without a moment's
interruption; whence the same John says elsewhere, <i>little children, it is the last hour.</i><b><sup>2</sup></b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

said to Daniel, <i>clausi sunt signatique
sermones</i>, and to Isaiah<i>, signavi
visionem in discipulis meis</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
But what does it mean that this vision is said to be sealed, while it is said
later, <i>seal not the words of the prophecy
of this book</i>,<b><sup>4</sup></b> if not
that these words are opened for the good, and closed with a seal for the
wicked? For it is not because of faithful servants, but because of thieves that
riches are sealed. Whence it is said to Daniel, <i>the wicked shall deal wickedly, but the learned understand</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b> Moreover, by saying <b>signified</b>, he showed that it should not
be taken literally, but by the word signification he made us intent on
examining the mysteries more deeply. So this vision was sent through an <b>angel</b>; but the unbounded Spirit that
sent it was there both in the one through whom he sent it and in the one to
whom he sent it. The same angel who appeared wore the figure of the Word
incarnate alone and of his body, which is the Church. <b>John</b> himself as well, whom he appeared to, presented the symbol of
the Church. However, one should not believe that the angel and John prefigured
two churches; but when the angel possesses the symbol of the Head, John
possesses that of the preachers, and when the angel possesses that of the
preachers, John possesses that of the listeners; and when by the angel are
represented the members that lead the way, by John are represented those that
follow; or in the angel we understand the Church glorified after the resurrection,
and in John the present Church needing to be instructed by Christ. Furthermore,
one should know that the Lord appears after his Ascension in the same way as he
appeared to the fathers before his Incarnation, namely through an angelic
creature. By this fact he clearly shows that he must not now be sought
physically for teaching, as he is present everywhere in majesty; for we should
not think that his humanity taken from the Virgin was present in the angel, but
that the angel expressed its figure. It is not at all surprising either that he
is called <i>like to the Son of man</i>,<b><sup>6</sup></b> when the prophet Daniel is
said to have called the angel Gabriel a man.<b><sup>7</sup></b> Moreover, it is</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Dan. 12:9: « The words are shut up, and sealed. » The Isaiah quote means « I
have sealed the vision among my disciples », which seems to be a variant of Is.
8:16.<span>  </span><i>Signum</i> means a sign, an ensign, or the image on a signet ring, and
hence a seal. The verb <i>signare</i>, which
derives from <i>signum</i>, means « to mark

(<i>signati</i>) that is used in the Daniel
passage, and another form of the verb (<i>signavi</i>)

calls the one who appeared to him in the bush sometimes “angel,” sometimes “God,”

in Asia</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">. By the number <b>seven</b> is represented the universal
Church, because of the seven gifts of him who has filled the earth. Hence
Elisha made the child upon whom he lay gape seven times,<b><sup>1</sup></b> because the people that died from unfaithfulness is
brought back to life by the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. So the number seven
is perfect, being formed by the number three and the number four; for the
number three is considered perfect in the divine Scriptures because of the
mystery of the Trinity, because of the three virtues: faith, hope, and love, or
because of the three classes of the faithful: preachers, celibates, and married
people. As for the number four, it is perfect because of the four parts of the
world, because of the four cardinal virtues (namely prudence, temperance,
courage, and justice) or because of the four books of the Gospels. Therefore,
because knowledge of the Trinity encompasses the four cardinal points of the
sky, because hope, faith, and love complete the sum of the four cardinal
virtues, or because the three classes of believers submit to the commandments
of the four Gospels, it is right for the universal Church to be symbolized by
this number seven. One should nonetheless know that it was especially to the <b>seven churches</b> of the Ephesians that he
sent these mysteries he wrote in exile. So species is not excluded, but in the
species a genus is shown, namely the universal Church. It is appropriate to say
that the universal Church is in Asia, for <b>Asia</b>
translates to “pride.” The word “pride” is not always used to refer to a vice,
but sometimes to the summit of virtue, as in <i>I will make thee to be the pride of worlds</i>,<b><sup>2</sup></b> that is “I will make you despise all pleasures and low
honors;” and elsewhere, <i>He hath lifted
thee up above the height of the earth</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
So it is in this height of pride that the Church takes its place.
Alternatively, if “pride” is being used to refer to a vice, we should not take
it to mean that the Church will remain proud, but that it was raised in the
arrogance of pride some time ago, but is predestined to become humble through a
heavenly gift, according to this: <i>Hast
thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or has thou beheld the treasures
of the hail: Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, against the day
of battle and war?</i><b><sup>4</sup></b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

put before <b>peace</b>, because no one
could have come to God's peace reconciled if the grace of mercy had not
preceded them. As for the fact that he says <b>from him that is, and that was, and that is to come</b>, it should be taken
as referring specifically to the only-begotten Son of God. He is in essence
with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and has never been affected by mutability,
according to this saying of Paul's: <i>There
was not in him « it is » and « it is not », but « it is » was in him</i>,<b><sup>1</sup></b> because, before he was
born of the Virgin in time, he spent all times with the Father. Whence the same
John says, <i>in the beginning was the Word</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> It is also the same who is
to come to judge the living and the dead in the humanity he assumed, as it is
written: <i>He shall so come, as you have
seen him going into heaven</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
So, since it is certain that the Church has received this grace from the Son
and the Holy Spirit as well as from the Father through the Son and the Holy
Spirit, why is the person of the Father not mentioned in this passage? Because
it is habitual in the sacred Scriptures, where one or two of the persons of the
Trinity are mentioned, for the whole Trinity to be understood at the same time.
As for the words <b>from the seven spirits</b>,
he says this because of the sevenfold operation of one spirit; and this spirit
is said to be alone in the sight of the throne, that is of the Church, that is
in the memory of the saints, because it is to this same spirit in particular
that the remission of sins is ascribed, according to this: <i>Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you shall forgive, they are
forgiven the</i>m.<b><sup>4</sup></b> Or if
not, then surely the whole Trinity is understood in the Spirit. In saying <b>from Jesus Christ</b>, he mentions the
person of the Son again, because the one referred to existed before the ages,
and was made man in the end of the ages.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Christ specifically <b>the faithful witness</b>,
while<i> there are three who give testimony:
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and the three are one</i> God.<b><sup>5</sup></b> One may also call the Son
specifically, in the role of man he assumed, a <b>faithful witness</b>, in that he went as far as the death of the flesh
for the sake of the testimony of the truth. For while the whole Church, in the
holy preachers, gives testimony concerning Christ, the ones called martyrs,
that is “witnesses,” <b><sup>6</sup></b>
are principally those who suffered physical death for Christ. He is called <b>first begotten</b> because no one before
him rose never to die. A different interpretation would be that all the saints
are dead to the world, as it is said in <i>for
you are dead</i>,<b><sup>7</sup></b> but he
is so in a special way, because there has been no sin in him. By <b>the kings</b>, he means either all the

also that he says <b>he was in the spirit</b>

in the spirit, so was the voice spoken to him spiritual. We should however ask
the question of what back a spirit could have to be able to hear a voice behind
him. It seems then that the face of that spirit was the very force of divine
contemplation, and its back, obliviousness of present matters. Therefore he
heard the voice in the things he had forgotten, the purpose of this being to
make him turn his mind's face towards them and write in a book everything he
saw; as if the voice were saying to him, “Those things which you are beginning
to see in the spirit of God, either have been done or must be done here, where
you hear me sounding without sound, that is on earth.” With the words <b>What thou seest, write</b>, it is as if he
were saying “what thou art about to see,” for he had not seen anything yet.
Allegorically, the Church hears a voice concerning its union with Christ,
behind it, from the law and the prophets, like this: <i>They shall be two in one flesh</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b>
This voice, whether with regards to the Church or with regards to John, is rightly
called <b>great</b>, because it speaks of
the highest mysteries, and because of that it is compared to a trumpet and
spread by the mouths of the preachers; whence it is said to one of them, <i>Lift up thy voice like a trumpet</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> This voice, through John,
tells the Church to write what it sees, that is, to keep it in mind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

We need to say how the interpretations of these names tally with the universal
Church. <span> </span><b>Ephesus</b> translates to “my will” or “my counsel”: and whose counsel,
but that of the one who<i> casteth away the
counsels of princes, but his counsel standeth forever</i>?<b><sup>3</sup></b> Moreover, the Church is the will of God, to which it
is said through the prophet, <i>Thou shalt
be called My will</i>.<b><sup>4</sup></b>
Note also that will pertains to love, while counsel pertains to correction.
Indeed, someone is the will of God when they submit to the Creator not out of
fear of punishment, but willingly; whereas if someone wants to join neither for
fear nor for love, they are given a speech of correction through the action of
divine mercy so that they may abandon their error and receive the counsel of
salvation.<span>  </span><b>Smyrna</b> translates to “their canticle,” that is the elect's, and
that canticle is the new commandment. Therefore the Church sings this canticle every
day when it fulfills the new commandment by loving God and neighbor. <span> </span><b>Pergamus</b>
translates to “separating their horns”: and whose horns but Christ's and the
Devil's? So by Christ's horns is represented his kingdom, that is the Church,
and by the Devil's horns, it is also his kingdom that is represented, that is
the wicked. Hear therefore the separation of the horns: <i>I will break all the horns of sinners, and the horns of the just shall
be exalted</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b> <span>  </span><b>Thyatira</b>
means “enlightened”: and what other enlightened one are we to understand, but
the one to whom it is said by Isaiah, <i>Arise,
be enlightened, O Jerusalem</i>?<b><sup>6</sup></b>
It is appropriate for the Church to be called enlightened, so that it should
remember that it used to be darkness; whence the apostle to its members: <i>You were heretofore darkness, but now light

By saying <b>to see</b>, he shows that it
was not a physical voice, which cannot be seen, but a spiritual one, with which
seeing it is no different from hearing it. Allegorically, the Church turned to
see the voice, because it directed its attention, out of the desire of its
mind, to the words of the law and of the prophets, so as to see their mysteries
now fulfilled. <b>And being turned, I saw
seven golden candlesticks: and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,
one like to the Son of man</b>. By the <b>seven
candlesticks</b> is represented the sevenfold Church, in whose midst is Christ,
who is called <b>like to the Son of man</b>
because he was now immortal, or because he appeared not with sin, but in the
likeness of the flesh of sin. We read that he appeared in the midst according
to this: <i>Where there are two or three
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them</i>.<b><sup>4</sup></b> It is appropriate for the
Church to be symbolized by seven golden candlesticks, for the sevenfold
operation of the Holy Spirit is symbolized by the number, and the brightness of
eternal wisdom is symbolized by gold. So just as gold, tried by fire and stretched
by blows, is made into a candlestick, so does the Church, melted by the fire of
tribulation until purification, and extended into long-suffering by the blows
of temptations, reach completion; whence Isaiah says, <i>The Lord hath said it, whose fire is in Sion, and his furnace in
Jerusalem</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b> Furthermore,
one should know that one Church is represented by both the <b>seven candlesticks</b> and the <b>Son
of man</b>, because the person of Christ and of the Church is one. So the same
Lord who appeared clothed with a garment down to the feet in the midst of the
candlesticks, put on as a garment the candlesticks themselves. Therefore, Christ's
clothes are the same as the seven candlesticks, that is the Church. Indeed
genus is joined to genus, when the Church is meant by both the seven
candlesticks and the Son of man. Note also that <b>the likeness to the Son of man</b> concerns us, because just as our
Head has risen again in deed, so have we in hope.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

means “feet” in Greek. What do we understand by the <i>poderes</i>, that is a tunic reaching the ankles, which Zechariah says
is a priestly garment,<b><sup>2</sup></b>
if not the flesh of Christ specifically, and the whole Church generally? Indeed,
by offering himself on the cross to God the Father, he carried out a
priesthood. Now, this priestly garment is down to the ankles because his body,
which is the Church, down to its very last members, fills up those things that
are wanting of the sufferings of Christ;<b><sup>3</sup></b>
or if not, then certainly his garment down to the ankles was his work of love
to the suffering of death. <b>And girt
about the paps with a golden girdle</b>. What one should know is that Daniel
saw a man girt about the loins<b><sup>4</sup></b>
and John saw him <b>girt about the paps</b>
because the Old Testament restrains the lust of the flesh, whereas the New
restrains also that of the mind. However, that double girding does not refer to
the Head, but to the limbs, since it is certain that our Redeemer has been
touched by neither the lust of the body nor that of the heart. So it is fitting
to say that this girdle was golden, because whoever is a citizen of the
heavenly fatherland, forsakes uncleanness, not out of fear of punishment, but
out of love for heavenly brightness. The order given to the apostles in the New
Testament, <i>Let your loins be girt</i>,<b><sup>5</sup></b> is given, through their
persons, to those who, not yet restraining the fornication of the flesh, belong
to the man of the old life; for the apostles themselves had already forsaken
the uncleanness of the flesh. Alternatively, the angel is <b>girt about the paps with a golden girdle</b> because the Church, coming
from two peoples, is united in Christ by the bond of love.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

just as the seven candlesticks represent not only the churches of Asia, but the
universal Church; and if we pay subtle attention, we also find the candlesticks
in these <b>seven stars</b>, that is, the
universal Church in the holy preachers. Whence, when the Lord speaks to one angel,
he says in the end: <i>Let him hear what the
Spirit saith to the churches</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b>
The <b>right hand</b> in this passage
should be understood to mean the utmost blessedness, which now is there in hope,
and will then be there in fact; whence this saying of Isaiah: <i>The right hand of my just one will uphold
thee</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> Then, when we hear
that the Church is held in the <b>right
hand</b>, from the whole we must understand a part, which must be placed on the
right hand in the future. <b>And from his
mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword</b>. What is symbolized by the <b>sword</b> but the preaching of the Old and
of the New Testament? As in this saying of Paul's: <i>and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b> It is right for it to be
called <b>two-edged</b>, because it cuts
off faults committed in deed on one side, and forbidden thoughts on the other;
or because it informs imperfect people on the outside according to the literal meaning,
and instructs perfect people on the inside according to the mystical meaning. <b>And his face was as the sun shineth in his
power</b>. By the <b>face</b> shining <b>as the sun</b>, we may understand the
elect, as in <i>The just shall shine as the
sun</i>.<b><sup>4</sup></b> If we wish to
understand <b>the sun </b>mentioned in this
sentence to mean the visible sun, we should know that it will then be of a
greater brightness than it now is, and the glory of the saints will then be
greater, as Isaiah attests, who says, <i>The
light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun
shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days: in the day when the Lord shall
bind up the wound of his people</i>;<b><sup>5</sup></b>
whence in this passage it is added <b>in his
power</b>. Alternatively: what is symbolized by the face of the angel but the
Redeemer's manifest incarnation, which had, as it were, a rising in being born,
a setting in dying, and again a rising in being resurrected? And since his
resurrection had already become well-known throughout the world, it is as if
the sun had gone up to the hours around midday when John was seeing these
things, and this is why he said, with those words added, <b>as the sun shineth in his power</b>.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

angel did with his hand laid upon him, but we deduce with a certain reasoning
that he lifted up from the ground either John or the Church in him. Now, can it
be that the Church was put away from the imitation of the sufferings of Christ?
No. Therefore the angel laying his hand upon John who lay <b>at his feet as dead</b> and raising him from the ground, is the
Redeemer Lord lifting up the Church which imitates his sufferings from sorrow
of the heart to the hope of future glory by encouraging it through the holy preachers,
as in <i>The sufferings of this time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b> He fittingly says <b>Fear not</b>, as if the Lord were saying to
the Church, “Receive confidence from above, and drive human fear away.”<span>  </span><b>I am
the First and the Last, and I was alive, and dead, and behold I am living for
ever and ever</b>. Here it is made clear that this angel specifically bore the person

by <b>death</b> is meant the one about whom

In this place, blessed John, either in his own person or in that of preceding

Church, which is represented by the <b>angel</b>.
In this angel, sometimes the whole body of the elect, which consists of holy
preachers and good listeners, is extolled by the proclamation of its merits,
sometimes a part in particular is censured as wicked. So, what does it mean
that the Redeemer Lord holds <b>stars in

of success? What does it mean that the same walks <b>in the midst of the candlesticks</b>, if not that he is present

The Lord says he knows the <b>works</b>, <b>labor</b>, and <b>patience</b> of the saints, which means that he approves them by the
grace of choosing. But then the speech turns back to a specific weak part of
the body when it is said after that, <b>and
how thou canst not bear them that are evil</b>: for it is not a sign of merit,
but of great weakness, that the angel cannot bear them that are evil. It is
also to be noted that he says below to the same angel, <i>Thou hast endured for my name</i>:<b><sup>1</sup></b>
which is not incompatible with this passage, because in the one is indicated
the weakness of some limbs, and in the other the strength of others. <b>And thou hast tried them, who say they are

false apostles had then spread in the Church of Ephesus, whom the same John
calls <i>Antichrists</i> in his epistle,<b><sup>2</sup></b> and in whose persons is

view to approbation, as in <i>The Lord your
God trieth you</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b> So
the Church tries the false ones when, through the preachers, it interrogates the
heretics about faith, to see whether they are disciples of the truth or of

book on heresies,<b><sup>2</sup></b> saying:
“Nicolas, according to the story, was one of the seven deacons who were ordained
by the apostles.<b><sup>3</sup></b> As he was
censured for jealousy towards his wife, who was very beautiful, he is said, in
order to exculpate himself, to have given permission for anyone who so wished
to use her. This deed of his gave rise to a most shameful sect, which has as a
principle the promiscuous use of women. Its followers also do not even keep
their food free of things sacrificed to idols.” Moreover, all the heretics
generally, are <b>Nicolaites</b>: indeed “Nicolas”
translates to “foolish people.” Therefore all those who do not hold the right
views concerning the Father's wisdom, which is the Son, even if they are wise
for the world, show that they are fools for God. We find <b>Nicolaites</b> even in the Church: namely those we see foolishly
amassing treasure in their love for the world. Finally, it is to be noted that
he does not say “Thou hatest the Nicolaites,” but <b>the deeds of the Nicolaites</b>, because it is demonstrated that the
Lord and those who are on his side do not hate in them the nature, which was
created good in them, but their execrable deeds.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

for <b>poverty</b>, we should understand
two kinds of it: for there is one poverty in renouncing earthly things, and
another in the contrition of the spirit, by which pride is decreased and
humility increased; which is the one about which the Lord says, <i>Blessed are the poor in spirit</i>;<b><sup>3</sup></b> for the one who is poor in
spirit is the one who, when he does good things, always notes that he is useless.
Therefore with the words, <b>I know thy

We should however ask the question of when the Jews lost their own name, since
the sacred Scripture calls them so even after the murder of the Redeemer, as in
the Acts of Apostles; but one should know that, while they falsely display this
name literally on the outside, they lost it in spirit on the inside when they
refused to confess Christ. Indeed, “Jew” translates to “confessor.”

the straits of oppressions that he indicated by the name of prison. When he
says not “you” but <b>some of you</b>, he wants
us to understand by this those who emerge victorious from the tribulations
inflicted on them. Now what does it mean that he confines the <b>tribulation</b> of the Church to a number
of <b>ten days</b>, if not that the Church
is doing battle against the various sufferings of persecutions and diverse
enticements of desires while submitting to the commandments of the Decalogue? <b>Be thou faithful until death: and I will

This is said to the universal Church, whose <b>works</b>, <b>charity</b>, and <b>faith</b> the Lord knows because he approves

order: for you first need to believe, then to love what you believe, and lastly

in extreme poverty. We should however ask the question of why the <b>last works</b> of the Church are declared
to be <b>more than the former</b>. So, one
should know that at first, the Gentiles converted to Christ were ordered by the
apostles to keep only four laws: namely to abstain from things sacrificed,
fornication, meat of animals killed by suffocation, and blood; but after a little
time had passed, they attained the summit of perfection, so that many of the
believers disregarded all things of the world. Either this is the explanation,
or it is because starting from the persecution of the Antichrist a greater
virtue of works will shine in the Church. Indeed, while the Church made up of
Gentiles is now working alone, it will then also bring the Jews to faith, and
thus work twice as much.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

sacrificed to idols</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">. These things do
not correspond to the one he honored with such great praise above, but they
refer specifically to the bad preachers who allow fornication and idolatry in
the Church by their negligence. It is not to be believed that <b>Jezabel</b> the wife of Ahab, who we know
was crushed by the hoofs of horses,<b><sup>1</sup></b>
physically survived until that time; but since there were then in that church
some people who imitated her sexual intercourses, the very mother of
fornications was censured in them: for the reprobates, united in an equality of
vices, constitute one body, which is that of the old enemy, just as the elect,
by the bond of virtues, make up one body, which is that of Christ. Jezebel's <b>fornication</b> is of four kinds: there is
fornication in pleasure, as in <i>Whosoever
shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with
her in his heart</i>;<b><sup>2</sup></b>
there is also <b>fornication</b> in deed,
whence the apostle: <i>Fly fornication,
brethren</i>;<b><sup>3</sup></b> there is
the <b>fornication</b> of idolatry,
according to this: <i>She played the harlot
with stones and with stocks</i>;<b><sup>4</sup></b>
and there is also the <b>fornication</b> of
covetousness, according to this: <i>covetousness,
which is the service of idols</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b>
It is also to be noted that <b>Jezabel
calls herself a prophetess</b>, and seduces God's <b>servants</b> because of that. So, when anyone says to a celibate, “Come,
let us enjoy what we desire, because if God did not wish this to happen, he
would not have created man and woman,” they are seeking to seduce a soldier of
God as though by prophesying. So, <b>Jezabel</b>
translates to “flow of blood,” “flowing,” or “dunghill.” By the name of blood
are symbolized sins, according to this: <i>Deliver
me from bloods</i>.<b><sup>6</sup></b> It
is said that what happens to women when they suffer their flow of blood is that
humor of blood collected during several days overflows and is discharged when
the menstrual time has come. It is demonstrated that it is what happens to the
universal Jezabel: a shameful pleasure accumulated during a long time springs
forth to open ugliness of works when the time has come. Then the mind grows
excessively anxious, and the man melts just like wax in front of fire; whence
it is right for her to be called “flowing.” Finally, by the very repetition of
the perpetration of lust, a stench of bad reputation is emitted far and wide,
whence it is fittingly that <b>Jezabel</b> translates
to “dunghill.”</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Satan, which is put in <b>a bed</b> not in
order that it may rest, but that it may run into madness: for by the name of <b>bed</b> are meant the audacity and feeling
of security to commit wrongs. She is said to be <b>put</b> in it by God not because he himself impels her, but because he
does not snatch her away from this illusion of security by punishing her; and
since increases of vices are like some kinds of torments, it is right for the <b>bed</b> to be called a <b>great tribulation</b>. The <b>bed</b>
may also indicate eternal torment; it seems to me this is why another
translator put “mourning” instead of <b>bed</b>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> <b>And the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and

to understand the very perpetrated wickedness of physical lust, because the seed

But can it be that before the Lord publicly unmasks idolaters and fornicators
and massacres them, the Church does not know that he is the Knower of secrets?
Or how can it be called Church, if it gets to know it by this outcome of events
rather than by faith? We should therefore hold the firm belief that, as far as the
present state of things is concerned, they are punished with a hidden death, so
that the meaning should be the following: When I condemn the reprobates
hiddenly and secretly, even then the faithful do not doubt that I know the
actions of everyone. <b>And I will give to
every one of you according to his work</b>s. He comes back from species to
genus. There is nothing more to be explained here, but there is more to be
feared. <b>To you I say, to the rest who

this <b>door</b> when they scourged the apostles
and charged them that they should not speak in the name of Jesus;<b><sup>1</sup></b> but since when he <b>opens, no man shuts</b>, they replied
immediately, <i>We cannot but speak the
things which we have heard</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b>
As this door was shut to the Asians, the apostles tried to open it; but since
when he <b>shuts, no man opens</b>, the
spirit of Jesus stopped them.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
The <b>open door</b> may also be taken to
mean the Scripture, through which we come in towards Christ with the steps of
faith. So he opens the door with <b>the key
of David</b>, and <b>no man shuts</b>,
because no one is able, with any veil of the Jews, to cast a shadow in the
elect's hearts over the words of the sacred Scripture, which he made his elect understand
spiritually by the grace of his incarnation. On the other hand, he <b>shuts</b> it for the unbelieving Jews, and
it cannot be opened by anyone. This too can be analyzed symbolically: <b>because thou hast a little strength, and
hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name</b>. Here it is no small
question that arises: how can someone have only a <b>little strength</b> if they keep the word of God and do <b>not deny his name</b>? We should know
therefore that it was said according to the estimation of human weakness,
because, while the elect are capable of many things through Christ, they presume
that they are capable of little. Indeed <b>Thou
hast a little strength</b> is said as if it were said “Thou thinkest that thou
hast a little strength.”</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

grace of the Spirit of both? Whence the apostle: <i>The Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons

peace.” It is said to <b>come down out of
heaven from God</b> because the Church of the elect, which directs its course
towards the sight of heavenly peace with the steps of love, went down, as it
was predestined to, into the womb of the Virgin together with the Lord, whose
body it is; or it is because its number increases every day through heavenly grace.

prayer? To him it is said in addition: <b>and
mayest be clothed in white garments, that the shame of thy nakedness may not
appear</b>. Someone is <b>clothed in white
garments</b> to cover <b>the shame</b> of
their <b>nakedness</b> when they <b>buy gold fire-tried</b>, convert to a new
life to avoid the shame of lukewarmness, and deserve, thanks to their imitation
of him, to be connected with the new and heavenly man. <b>And anoint thy eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see</b>. As if it
were saying: Apply the divine commandments to your blind mind, so that you may
see the nakedness in virtues you are suffering from and hurry to cover it.
Indeed, if the divine commandments were not <b>eye salve</b>, the Psalmist would not say, <i>The commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> <b>Eye salve</b>, which is made from earth and removes the dust of the
earth from the eyes, may represent the temporal poverty our Redeemer assumed
for us. Therefore let him who has his eyes blinded with dust put <b>eye salve</b> on them to recover sight,
that is, let him who gets lost due to earthly pleasures bring back to his mind
his Redeemer's temporal poverty, so that he may contemplate with his inward
eyes the future rewards of the saints.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The Redeemer's Nativity is recapitulated, and these things had already been said
with various other symbols; as when one relates one event in different ways,
the narrations will each have a different time, but not the event itself, which
happened in one time. We should however ask the question of why John does not disclose
the time of his prophecy, while other prophets used to disclose by the kings
the length of the interval between one vision and another. It is because he is
informing us that the whole time of the Church should be related to that
continuous day of resurrection about which it is said, <i>Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection</i>;<b><sup>1</sup></b> for the first
resurrection, that is the one by which souls rise again from the death of sin
to the life of justice, is now going on all the time. Now with what eyes did
John see this <b>door</b>? As far as the
figurative vision is concerned, he did not of course see it with the eyes of
the flesh, but with those of the mind; but for what concerns the truth of the
thing itself, truth which had already been manifested when the Lord had appeared
in the flesh, not only did he see it with the eyes of the flesh, but he even
touched it with his hands. The open <b>door</b>
represents Christ, who has already been manifested to all the faithful by being
born, dying, and rising again. It is appropriate for this <b>door</b> to be seen <b>in heaven</b>,
that is in the Church, because it is in the Church that people proclaim and
believe that our Redeemer was born, suffered, was resurrected, and went up to
heaven. <b>And the first voice which I
heard, was, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, saying: Come up hither</b>.
Whither, but to the <b>door</b> and <b>heaven</b>, that is Christ and the Church?
And with what steps, but those of faith? It is right for John to be invited to
this by the <b>first voice</b>, because
every one of the elect, in order that they may reach the mysteries of the true
faith through the Gospel without the foot of belief striking against any obstacle,
is strengthened by the teaching of the Old Testament, which preceded the new
teaching. It is also right for this <b>voice</b>
to be compared to <b>a trumpet</b>, because
it is calling us to a spiritual war; whence this: <i>Lift up thy voice like a trumpet</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> In what is said after that, <b>I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter</b>, he does
not deny that the Church already has high honors, but he shows that they will
last until the end of the world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Both <b>heaven</b> and <b>the throne</b> represent the Church, for genus is joined to genus in

Son of man appearing in the midst of the golden candlesticks: the only difference
is that there he is walking, that is bestowing gifts, and here he is <b>sitting</b>, that is making judgment
between everyone by administering justice according to the gifts they have been

By <b>the jasper</b>, which is green, are
represented the green pastures of the paradise; and what are those pastures but
Christ's divinity, in which all things live? As the same John said, <i>He that hath the Son, hath life</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b> By <b>the sardine stone</b>, which has a resemblance to red earth, is
represented our Redeemer's humanity, because <i>truth is sprung out of the earth</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> The species of these stones may also represent the
Church. <b>And there was a rainbow round
about the throne, like to the sight of an emerald</b>. By the <b>rainbow</b> is represented the
reconciliation of the world achieved through the plan of the Word incarnate.
Indeed the sun illuminated a cloud and <b>a
rainbow</b> appeared, because when the Father's Word, which is the <i>Sun of justice</i>,<b><sup>3</sup></b> shed rays of light on human nature by adopting it,
this very adoption of his humanity, which is called a cloud by the prophet,<b><sup>4</sup></b> became the reconciliation
of the world. The very interpretation of the noun agrees with this, for if you
add one letter and say <i>irini</i>, it
means “peace” in Greek.<b><sup>5</sup></b>
When he illuminates the solid hearts of the saints, which are called clouds, they
give the appearance of a bow, because they are bent towards piety by the fact
of praying to God. There is here a fitting connection of symbols, because
below, <i>lightnings and thunders</i> are
said to <i>proceed from the throne</i>, as
though from a cloud. Then, since <b>a

John says there are <b>twenty-four</b>, if
not that, because of the two testaments, the number of the twelve tribes is
also doubled? Therefore, regarding the distinction between both testaments,
there are <b>twenty-four</b> thrones, and
as many <b>ancients</b>; but regarding the

the elect to the love of God and neighbor. As for the <b>sea of glass</b>, what is symbolized by it but baptism? And why is it
of <b>glass</b>, if not because the faith
of those who go through it is being indicated with a figurative expression, in which
what is caused is being represented by what causes it? Indeed, just as in <b>glass</b> you can see nothing from the
outside but that which is carried inside of it, so is the Church's faith
sincere in its belief on the inside, and so does it appear truthful in
confession on the outside. Yet, so that it should not be thought to be fragile
like <b>glass</b>, it was added <b>like to crystal</b>. Indeed, just as ice compressed
by the winter's cold, after many years, hardens in such a way that it resembles
a stone and becomes <b>crystal</b>, so is
the faith of the saints solidified with time among oppressions. <b>And in the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind</b>.
No one doubts that by these <b>four living
creatures</b> are represented the four evangelists. But if they are <b>in the midst of the throne</b>, how can
they be said to be <b>round about the
throne</b>? Especially since it has already been said that the Lord was <b>sitting in the midst of the throne, and the
twenty-four ancients round about the throne</b>. One should know then that the <b>living creatures</b> are found in the Lord,
and the Lord in the <b>living creatures</b>;
and again the <b>living creatures</b> in
the <b>ancients</b>, and the <b>ancients</b> in the <b>living creatures</b>. The species of the <b>four creatures</b> may also indicate the Church in general. So the <b>living creatures</b> <b>are full of eyes</b> because as many words of the sacred Scriptures as there
are, there are so many spiritual lights for the elect, by which they are
illuminated to faith. <b>Their eyes are
before and behind</b> because they contain in themselves the mysteries of the
Old and of the New Testament. For <b>before</b>
is used in this passage to mean the past. Alternatively, they have <b>eyes before and behind</b> because they
announce some things that have been fulfilled and some that are to be
fulfilled, or because they lament past sins and guard against future ones.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Ezek. 1:5 et seq. However, Ezekiel rather speaks of four living creatures each

Then, although these <b>wings</b> are two,
because of the doubled number twelve found in the tribes of Israel and the
apostles, they are multiplied by twelve, and give twenty-four. In the same way,
because of the knowledge of the Trinity that they spread throughout the world,
they are also multiplied by three, and six appear in all. Alternatively, the <b>six wings</b> may be taken to mean the six
laws: the first which is the natural law, the second which is that of Moses,
the third which is that of the prophets, the fourth which is that of grace, the
fifth which is that of the apostles, and the sixth which is that of the synods;
by all of which the Church flies to heaven. <b>And round about and within they are full of eyes</b>. The <b>living creatures are full of eyes both

God day and night, that is in success and in adversity. By the fact of saying <b>holy</b> thrice, they indicate the three Persons.
On the other hand, by saying <b>Lord God

can the words <b>who is to come</b> in the
aforementioned praise correspond to the Trinity, when only the Son will come in
his humanity to judge? One should know then that the invisible Trinity will
assume the person of the Son and examine the just and sinners through it. It will
not however come by passing from one place to another, but by showing its
manifest power through the human form adopted by it, which will come down from
heaven to the lower regions. We may also understand in this passage the
divinity's present coming by which its saints are illuminated every day.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the midst of the church will I praise thee</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b> As for what we read elsewhere, <i>The Lord is round about his people</i>,<b><sup>2</sup></b> it is not incompatible, because he both presides in
the middle where he rules and judges it, and goes round about it to protect and

were shown examination and kingdom, while here is shown assistance? Indeed
sitting is the attitude of one reigning and judging, while <b>standing</b> is the attitude of one giving assistance. Note also that
he is seen not slain, but <b>as it were
slain</b>; for even though he was crucified due to weakness, he lives by the
power of God. Alternatively, Christ is, not slain, but <b>as it were slain</b>, every time his limbs either mortify themselves
voluntarily or endure persecutions so as to fill up in themselves those things

operation, which is demonstrated not only to have rested in the Head, but also
to have illuminated the entire body, which is why in this passage <b>the seven spirits of God</b> are said to
have been <b>sent forth into all the earth</b>.
This sevenfold operation, which is symbolized by the <b>horns</b> because of its kingdom and strength, is also fittingly
represented by the <b>eyes</b> because it
illuminates the Church. Alternatively, by the <b>horns</b>, which rise above the flesh, we may also understand the more

It is fitting for the sufferings of Christ to be symbolized by <b>harps</b>, for in a <b>harp</b> some strings are stretched more tightly and others more
loosely, but, albeit stretched differently, they do not at all produce each a
different song: it is the same with the different members in the body of
Christ: some imitate his sufferings more fully and others less, but they
resound with one praise in harmony. So the <b>living
creatures and the ancients fall before the Lamb with harps</b> because all the
saints attribute the merit of everything they suffer for Christ to Christ and
not to themselves. By <b>the golden vials</b>
we understand love, a love capable of praying not only for friends but also for
enemies, which is why it is said that they were <b>full</b>. It is right for the <b>vials</b>
to be mentioned after the <b>harps</b>,

encompassed in three kinds, namely one kind pertaining to speech, one
pertaining to cognition, and one pertaining to action. Speech includes in

the Church, when, after the nations had been united in faith, the divine power
restrained the Devil from hurting the elect; as if he were told by mockery, “The
rider of the white horse has chosen and purchased the <b>wheat</b>, <b>barley</b>, <b>wine</b>, and <b>oil for one penny;</b> and he has left for you the chaff, husks, and
oil dregs.” So one <b>two-pound</b> measure,
which is made up of two <i>sextarii</i>, is
the Church based on love of God and neighbor from the two Testaments. However
we should understand here one Church consisting of the holy preachers or men of
great merit, not of everyone in general. Indeed it is not without reason that <b>barley</b> is here mentioned after the <b>wheat</b>. Therefore let us take the <b>two pounds of wheat</b> as representing the
new preachers of the Church, coming from two peoples, and men more outstanding
in virtues, who, after being shattered by the mill of tribulations and cooked by
the fire of persecutions, have deserved to become a beautiful white bread for
Christ. Let us take thrice <b>two pounds of

Note also that the price of the <b>wheat</b>
and of the <b>barley</b> is the same, because
even though the work of the saints is unequal, they were nonetheless bought for
the same price, and they will receive the same <b>penny</b> after their work.<b><sup>1</sup></b>
Furthermore, it should be noted that the same idea is repeated when it is said
afterwards <b>See thou hurt not the wine

oppressions and dissolved as a crushed olive in the oil press of straits?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

What does it mean that the souls of the saints ask for <b>revenge for their blood</b> about the persecutions, if not that they
are waiting for the day of the last judgment? It is not by the stomach being
drawn by the gullet that the words of the souls are formed, but their great cry
is a great longing. However, since a mind that is asking for something is generally
moved in a different way from a mind that is asked for something, and since the
souls of the saints cling to God in such a way that they rest in clinging to
him, how can they be said to ask for this, while it is certain that they are
ignorant of neither the will of God nor things that will happen? One should
know then that the reason why they are said to ask something from him while they
are in him is not that they long for a revenge because it is in disagreement
with the will of him whom they see, but they receive from him himself the task
to ask from him what they know he wants to do.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

nothing of their virtues, <b>hide
themselves in the caves and dens of mountains</b> because they seek the
intercessions of saints, who are rightly called <b>mountains</b> because they are high in virtues and look down on earthly
things, and rightly called <b>rocks</b>
because they are strong, as they are necessarily strengthened in Christ, who is
a rock. Hence the Lord says in the Gospel, <i>Then
they that are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains</i>;<b><sup>3</sup></b> and Solomon, <i>The
rabbit, a weak people, maketh its bed in the rock</i>;<b><sup>4</sup></b> and Isaiah says, <i>They

Ref. to Is. 5:22. « At drunkenness » is how the Douay-Rheims bible translates
the Latin phrase used here (<i>ad miscendam
ebrietatem</i>); however it literally means « at mingling drunkenness ». The
Latin verb for « to mingle » can also mean « to share » or « to stir up ». The
Hebrew original (as a friend kindly told me; I do not myself know Hebrew) has
something that means « mixing strong drink », as reflected in the KJV
translation. It is hard to say how the author of our text himself interpreted
the phrase, but it is likely that he had access to the Latin version only and
not the Hebrew.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

he seems to have kept the order all the way from the first to the sixth seal, but,
omitting the seventh, he comes back to the beginning of Christ's incarnation
and briefly recapitulates with different allegorical symbols the things he had
already related, and then he concludes these same two narrations with the
seventh seal. Recapitulation is not always done in this way, but in various
ways. So what do we understand to be symbolized by the <b>four angels</b> but the body of the old enemy? It is because of the
four principal kingdoms of the world, namely that of the Assyrians, that of the
Medes, that of the Persians or Macedonians, and that of the Romans, in which
the Devil reigned through the cult of idolatry, that <b>four angels</b> are put into the reprobate category. This is why
Nebuchadnezzar saw a statue whose head <i>was
of gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of
brass, and the legs of iron</i>;<b><sup>1</sup></b>
for the kingdom of the Assyrians is symbolized by gold, that of the Medes by
silver, that of the Persians or Macedonians by brass, and that of the Romans by
iron. It is not surprising that bad people are symbolized by <b>angels</b>, since it was said about Judas, <i>One of you is a devil</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> One should also know that
the <b>four angels</b> are the same as the <b>four winds</b>, according to the prophecy of
Daniel, who says, <i>Behold the four winds
strove upon the great sea, and four beasts, different one from another, came
down out of the sea</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
Indeed he indicates that the winds and the beasts are the same, that is the
four aforesaid kingdoms. Therefore when the angels <b>hold the winds</b>, they necessarily hold themselves; and since all
people of this kind are the Devil's body, he himself is also understood in them.
So what does it mean that the <b>four
angels held the four winds of the earth that they should not blow</b>, if not
that the hidden enemy and his whole body united and bound themselves together,
and blocked the mouth of everyone in such a way that no one dared to breathe
out the word of truth against the cult of idolatry? By <b>the earth</b> is represented the diversity of provinces, and by <b>the sea</b> the numerousness of islands.
The <b>trees</b> as well, since he has
mentioned no genus, because of their diversity, symbolize the various offices
of people. Now since they were being choked by the Devil, they were saved by the

So <b>Juda</b> translates to “confession”
or “laudation.” What else does this name's interpretation indicate but the
confession of sins and the praise of virtues? Though the word “confession” appears
to be sometimes used for “praise,” whence the Lord, who had no sin whatsoever,
said, <i>I confess to thee, O Father</i>,
etc.<b><sup>3</sup></b> By <b>Ruben</b>, which means “he who sees the child”
or “they who see the child,” are represented the very works of virtues, for the
fruit of good works is often symbolized by the word “children,” according to
this: <i>Mayest thou see thy children' s
children</i>,<b><sup>4</sup></b> which
means the virtues born from your virtues. Then since works of virtues must
serve the progress of others, he is rightly called “he who sees the child.”

prove to be strong against temptation, it fits them well because the same <b>Gad</b> also means “girded.” Since we ought
to direct the end of our good struggles towards God rather than towards the
facade of human praise, the aforesaid <b>Gad</b>
also means “robber,” as if he acquired secretly the goods of the heart to offer
them to God in order that they may be approved, rather than exposed them to
human eyes in order that they may be exalted. So since the tribulation
inflicted on them tests the elect and crowns them after the test, it is right
for <b>Gad</b> to be followed by <b>Aser</b>, which means “blessed;” and since
the warriors of the Church, strengthened by the promise of blessedness, are
prompted by feelings of love to spread even among the wicked, it is fitting for
<b>Aser</b> to be followed by <b>Nephthali</b>, which means “wideness.”
Since when they run through this greatest commandment of love, they both forget
the things that are behind and stretch forth<b><sup>1</sup></b> to the eternal riches that are to come, it is
appropriate for <b>Nephthali</b> to be
followed by <b>Manasses,</b> which is taken
to mean “having forgotten” or “necessity:” <span> </span>“having forgotten” because he has only let go
of what was behind, and “necessity” because he has not yet reached what he is
stretching towards. Since their desire is often put off for a long time, it is
right for <b>Manasses</b> to be followed by
<b>Simeon</b>, which translates to “I have
heard sorrow;” but those who hear sorrow must necessarily also hear “the name
of the dwelling,” which <b>Simeon</b> also
seems to mean, so that those who mourn in the tabernacle of decay should
rejoice in the dwelling of eternal rest.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

for what kind of people all these are, it is indicated by the one listed next, <b>Levi</b>, which means “added;” for such
people, going further than the general commandments, add many things that have
not been ordered, like celibacy in holy virginity, and all other things of the
kind: since these things are not ordered, but advised, it is necessarily the
case that non-ordered things are being voluntarily added. It is quite fitting
for these people that <b>Levi</b> is
followed by <b>Issachar</b>, which translates
to “reward,” because an exceptional and special reward is owed to those who do
these things; whence Jeremiah says to one of them, <i>Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for there is
a reward for thy work, saith the Lord</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b>
However, before people doing such things are rewarded, persecutions are usually
inflicted on them, and test them, but do not overcome them. Therefore it is not
without good reason that <b>Issachar</b> is
followed by <b>Zabulon</b>, which means
“dwelling of strength,” for any of these people becomes its dwelling when <i>power is made perfect in infirmit</i>y.<b><sup>3</sup></b> Then, since they freely
expend the talent of the divine Word not only for their friends in time of

think that there are twelve vocations in the Church, since there are only
three, namely the virtues of virgins, celibates, and good married people. Among
all this, we should by no means omit the question of why Dan, who is undoubtedly
a son of Jacob, is, whether in Genesis or in Exodus, counted with all his
brothers, but was rejected from the spiritual list in this Apocalypse, while <b>Manasses</b>, who was born among strangers,
and was indubitably not his son although he was adopted as his son,<b><sup>1</sup></b> seems to have been
substituted in the sixth place. So, “Dan” translates to “the judgment” or “the
judging one of the Hebrews who go by.” What is this “judgment of the Hebrews
who go by” but the rejection of the old priesthood? Therefore Dan, rejected
from the spiritual list, teaches us by the very interpretation of his name that
in the sixth age of the world the perfidious Jewish people was, by a mysterious
but just judgment, altogether expelled from its place and lost the dignity of
priesthood, while <b>Manasses</b>, that is
the people of the Gentiles, gained by grace to be substituted in its place.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

what does it mean that one of the ancients is said to have answered? It is a
habit of the sacred Scripture to use this verb like that, but it does not seem
to have any meaning, so neither is ignorance of it harmful nor is knowledge of
it praiseworthy. So, by this one <b>ancient</b>
we understand the unity of the preachers of both Testaments, or him who is more
ancient than ancients, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, who interrogates John in order
that the latter may himself ask, and, after asking, hear, understand, and rouse
himself up to imitate. By the <b>white
robes</b> we understand both purity of mind and the glory they will be granted
in the future. When John responds to this, in the person of good listeners, <b>My Lord, thou knowest</b>, the <b>ancient</b> replies, in the person of the
Lord or of his good preachers, <b>These are
they who are come out of great tribulation</b>, etc. In <b>are come</b>, three tenses are contained: it is here used for “are
come, are coming, and are to come.” Therefore, since the whole number of the
elect is defined by this sentence, it is greatly to be feared that if someone
comes from somewhere else, they should not belong to the fellowship of the
elect. The tribulations of the just, as the Psalmist says, are many;<b><sup>1</sup></b> and among these
tribulations there is that general one which consists of the fact that none of

its members, it departs from the abundance of material things to seek the retreat
of inner contemplation; but because this <b>silence</b>
cannot be perfect in this life, it is said to have lasted <b>as it were for half an hour</b>. Note also that he ended the

the sight of God; and there were given to them seven trumpets. And another
angel came, and stood before the altar, having a golden censer</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">. In this place he upsets the order of the narration
and interposes something; for, as the following will show, the <b>angel</b> with the <b>censer</b> <b>came and stood before
the altar</b> before they received the <b>seven
trumpets</b>. He interposes something because he introduced this <b>angel</b> with the <b>censer</b> in the middle before he had finished talking about the
others. So, what do we understand by the <b>seven
angels</b> but the holy Church in its preachers, who are the announcers of
eternal life? It is also right for them to be said to be <b>seven</b> in number, because they are filled up with the sevenfold
Spirit, or because they are put in charge of the totality of believers. They
are said to be <b>standing in the sight of
God </b>because they have trodden earthly desires underfoot and stick to divine
contemplation. What is shown by their <b>seven
trumpets</b> but the perfect preaching of the Old and of the New Testament?
According to this: <i>Lift up thy voice like
a trumpet</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b> By the
fact that it is the office of a priest to stand by the altar and burn incense prepared
with spices, we realize that this <b>angel</b>
is the Mediator between God and men, the Angel of the <b>seven angels</b>, and, so to speak, the Pontiff of the seven priests, he
about whom the prophet said, <i>angel of
great counsel</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> From
this we clearly gather that he came before the <b>seven angels</b> received the <b>trumpets</b>.
By the <b>altar</b> are represented the
elect, in whom a spiritual sacrifice is being performed. So, the <b>angel came</b> by the flesh, <b>and stood</b> by the divinity. Also, what
is represented by the <b>censer</b> but
Christ's humanity? It is appropriate for it to be called <b>golden</b>, because the flesh assumed by the Word of God is, together
with him, the wisdom about which it is said, <i>Take wisdom as gold</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
The <b>censer</b>, in which spices are
burned, may also symbolize the Church, which says every day, kindled by the
fire of divine love, <i>Let my prayer be
directed as incense</i>, etc.<b><sup>4</sup></b>
Then it is rightly said after that concerning Christ alone: <b>And there was given to him much incense,
that he should offer of the prayers of the saints upon the golden altar, which
is before the throne</b>. <b>And the smoke
of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the
hand of the angel</b>. Just as smoke comes out of burned spices, so is the
virtue of devotion produced by zeal for prayer. However, in order for the <b>incense</b> to become pleasing to God, it
is given to the angel, which means that the zeal of <b>prayers</b> is entrusted to our Redeemer. The body is totally unable to
speak to God but by the agency of the Head. The fact that the <b>incense</b> is offered on <b>the golden altar</b> shows that the
sacrifice of <b>prayers</b> is accepted by
him nowhere else but in the body of Christ, all of which shines with the wisdom
of the divine Word. Note also that the <b>throne</b>
and the <b>altar before the throne</b> do
not signify two Churches, but one, just like Noah's ark and the eight souls in
it.<b><sup>5</sup></b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

but to figurative quantity, and this is shown by the very change that says in
one place that two thirds came into the lot of the reprobates, in another place
that it was three thirds, and in a third place one third. What is more, above
he divided the whole body of the Devil into four parts, now in two thirds, then
in three, then in one; but one <b>third</b>
is not smaller than two or three; for when he divides the Devil's body into four
parts, he wants us to understand one part in the Church, consisting of false
brothers, and three outside, namely the heretics, the Jews, and the pagans.
When he divides the whole body into three thirds, we should understand one
onefold part inside consisting of the wicked faithful, one twofold part outside
consisting of the Jews and heretics, and also one onefold part outside,
consisting of the Gentiles. When he symbolizes one part of the body by the same
tripled number three, making two parts in all out of the three thirds, he wants
us to understand there both hidden and overt heretics. There remains one third
inside and outside, which retains in itself the symbols of all. When he divides
the Devil's body into two thirds, he wants us to understand one onefold third
inside consisting of bad Christians, and one threefold third outside consisting
of the Jews, heretics, and pagans. One should also know that the <b>earth</b> is the same as the <b>trees</b>, that is the sum of the wicked encompassed
in two thirds, one of which is onefold, and the other threefold: for sinners
are the <b>earth</b> because they seek
earthly things, and they are <b>trees</b>
because they sway to and fro in their instability. About these it is said by
Jude, <i>These are trees of the autumn,
unfruitful, plucked up by the roots, twice dead</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b> So two thirds are burned up by the sending of <b>hail and fire with blood</b>, and one is
left unharmed by this, because, as the wrath of the heavenly Judge increases
and the society of the old enemy is not gathered together by the preaching of
the saints, this society is put on fire by the flames of its own hatred,
whereas Christ's congregation is harassed by the hatred of the wicked, but it
is not consumed by it. As for what is said after that, <b>All green grass was burnt up</b>, it seems to be a repetition of the
same idea: all <b>green grass was burned up</b>
in the two thirds; <b>all green grass</b>,
that is the said part of the wicked, consumed by the flames of its own hatred.
The greenness of <b>grass</b> indeed
signifies here the enticements of the flesh, according to this: <i>All flesh is grass</i>;<b><sup>2</sup></b> whence, on the other hand, it is told that the crowds
fed by the Lord sat <i>upon green grass</i>,<b><sup>3</sup></b> which means that they
subdue the pleasures of the flesh by repressing them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

throughout the other prophecies we find a great many things that correspond to

down from heaven, clothed with a cloud</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">.
It is right for him to be called an <b>angel</b>,
because he appeared to men as the new messenger of eternal life, about whom we
read, <i>angel of great counsel</i>;<b><sup>1</sup></b> and to be called <b>strong</b>, because it is demonstrated that
he overcame the aerial powers when he died, whence this: <i>the Lord mighty in battle</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b>
When he says <b>another</b>, it does not
mean that he is actually talking about something different, but it is the habit
of recapitulation: he saw <b>another angel</b>
because he repeated another vision. The <b>angel</b>
appeared <b>clothed with a cloud</b>
because it was clothed in the flesh that the Lord was seen among men, and his descent
from heaven was precisely his adoption of the flesh. <b>And a rainbow was on his head</b>. The head of Christ, as the apostle
says, is the divinity itself.<b><sup>3</sup></b>
By the <b>rainbow</b> is symbolized the reconciliation
of the world that was achieved by the plan of the Word incarnate; its mystery
was explained earlier. Note also that, having described the last struggle, and
passing over the seventh seal, with which both the end of the consummation and
the Lord's coming are expected to take place, he comes back to the beginning of
Christ's incarnation, which has just been spoken about, and describes his
preaching. Once this narration is finished, he comes back to the things he had
left aside for a while. Let us however remember that when he has brought this narration
to its end, the end needs to be joined to the broken order; for the passage
where it is said, in the following, <i>The second
woe is past</i>,<b><sup>4</sup></b>
implicitly refers to the one where, in the end of the previous book, we spoke
of the destruction of the wicked horses and Gentiles. Note also that he behaves
in an unusual manner in this narration, and delimits both narrations not with
one end, but with two, because he distinguishes the interrupted order and the
recapitulation separately, as will become apparent a bit later. <b>And his face was as the sun</b>. The

by means of which he became known to mortals, and concerning which the Psalmist

When the Lord forbids swearing, what does it mean that he himself <b>swears</b>, if not that men are often
mistaken in swearing, whereas he, who is the truth, is never mistaken? So, the <b>angel lifting up his hand to heaven</b> was
our Redeemer carrying his humanity up to the Father's seat by his own power.
His <b>swearing by him that lives for ever
and ever</b> means that he shows that he, who is the Father's Word, and his flesh,
which indicates the whole man, who consists of flesh and soul, are one person
of God and the true God of man; or if it is not this, then certainly he <b>swears</b> by the Father because he
attributes him everything. In what is said after that, <b>who created heaven, and the things which are therein; and the earth,
and the things which are in it; and the sea, and the things which are therein</b>,
he refutes the error of the heretics who are not afraid to claim that some
things were made by the good prince and others by the prince of darkness. Now
let us hear what he <b>swore</b>: <b>That time shall be no longer, but in the
days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the
mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the
prophets</b>. The <b>seventh angel</b> and
the seventh <b>trumpet</b> are the end of
the Church's preaching, with the completion of which the second coming of the
Lord is expected to take place. However, if time shall be no longer when holy
preaching has come to an end, how can the Psalmist say, <i>Their time shall be forever</i>?<b><sup>2</sup></b>
One should know then that for the just, whom the eternity of immortality will
receive, no time of changeableness will come after that; whereas the unjust,
whom an eternal decline will take possession of, will be as if they were
confronted with times of mutability: for, since time declines moment by moment,
it is fitting for the decline of the wicked to be called by the name of time.
Therefore the Psalmist affirms concerning the unjust </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The <b>voice</b> that ordered him above to
seal the voices of the thunders for those who would not believe them or for little
people, is now inviting the holy Church, in its preachers, to <b>the book</b> open. This <b>voice</b> is understood to be a spiritual
one with which God instructs the hearts of preachers so that they may understand
the manifest truth of the law and the prophets, which is shut, whether in the
seven thunders or in the seven seals, for those who are doomed to perish
altogether. The steps with which the holy Church goes to <b>the angel</b> are not physical, but spiritual; they are the mental
desire by which it is seen to come closer to God. Then since the <b>voice</b> of <b>the angel</b> giving this order is followed by a most ready state of
mind on the saints' part, it is rightly said after that:</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Then since the one who invites him to what he promised deceives no one, it is
fittingly said after that, <b>And he said
to me: Take the book, and eat it up</b>. To <b>eat up the book</b> means to store away understanding of the Scriptures
in the recesses of one's heart. One should know indeed that the sacred
Scripture is for us a food in its obscure passages, which cannot be swallowed
down unless they are chewed by means of explanation, and a drink in its obvious
passages, which we easily drink just as they are found, without explanation.
This is why, although the holy preachers, in John's person, already understood
that the revealed mysteries of the Scriptures were about the Lord, because they
still needed explanations as to how they concerned him, it is not said about
the book, “Take the book, and drink it,” but <b>eat it up</b>, as if it were said, “Study it as if you were chewing it,
and understand it, and then swallow it down.” <b>And it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet
as honey</b>. The order is inverted, but it is found in the right order a
little below, for there follows:</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

This <b>voice</b> is the one about which
the apostle says, <i>The Lord himself shall
come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and
with the trumpet of God</i>.<b><sup>1</sup></b>
<b>And they went up to heaven in a cloud:
and their enemies saw them</b>. They go up <b>in
a cloud</b>, that is, in the power of him who judges. This is why the Lord,
after subduing death, went up to the Father's seat <b>in a cloud</b>. As for what we said earlier, that the bodies of the two
witnesses consisted of living and dead people, we bring here a suitable witness
to confirm it, Paul, who says, <i>We who are
alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet
Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord</i>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> So if, as the apostle
says, those who are found alive will be taken up in the clouds into the air to
meet Christ, is the Psalmist then lying when he says, <i>Who is the man that liveth, and shall not see death</i>?<b><sup>3</sup></b> And the book of Genesis
when it says, <i>Earth thou art, and into
earth thou shalt go</i>?<b><sup>4</sup></b>
No! For, as father Augustine says, at the very moment when they are taken up in
the clouds, they will taste a momentaneous death. It is the same for the body
to return into the earth and for the body to remain there when the soul leaves
it, because the body is earth anyway. As for how quick both changes will be,
the apostle indicates it, affirming that it will all happen <i>in the twinkling of an eye</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

sit on their seats in the sight of God, fell on their faces</span></b><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">. Concerning the <b>ancients</b>,
it has already been said that they signify the preachers, because a genus
should be understood in the species. It is right for them to be <b>twenty-four</b> because of the twelve
tribes and the twelve apostles. By the <b>seats</b>
and the <b>ancients</b> is understood one
seat, that of Christ, consisting of superiors and inferiors. It is right to say
that the <b>ancients sit in the sight of
God</b>, because, when they examine the actions of their inferiors, they do not
seek thereby human gratitude, but God's glory. They <b>fall on their faces</b> because they attribute all good not to
themselves, but to <b>God.</b> <b>And adored</b> <b>God</b>, <b>saying:</b> <b>We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty,
who wast, and who art</b>. By the fact that they do not say “who art to come,”
it is made clear that all this will be said or done at the last judgment. As
for what follows, <b>because thou hast
received thy great power, and the nations were angry</b>, it refers to his
first coming. He received in his humanity <b>the
great power </b>he has always had by his divinity. On the other hand, what is
said next, <b>because thy wrath is come,
and the time of the dead</b>, refers to his second coming. Yet since the Lord
says, <i>Love your enemies</i>,<b><sup>1</sup></b> how can it be said that
these people are giving <b>thanks</b> for
the coming of his wrath against the reprobates? Therefore they are not
rejoicing at the destruction of the wicked, but at their own resurrection and
glorification, which they know cannot possibly be fulfilled unless the
damnation of the wicked comes first. It is according to this interpretation
that the souls of the slain under the altar of God are said to cry, <i>How long, O Lord</i>, etc.;<b><sup>2</sup></b> for they are not asking
for revenge, but to be themselves rewarded after revenge has been taken on the
wicked. Hence the Psalmist: <i>The just
shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge</i>.<b><sup>3</sup></b> The Judge's wrath does not mean a perturbation of the
mind, but its straightness. So one shall see him such as one's own conscience
is like. <b>That thou shouldest judge them,
and render reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints, and to them that
fear thy name, little and great</b>. When the apostle says that <i>we are saved by grace</i>,<b><sup>4</sup></b> how can the Lord be said
here to <b>render reward</b>? One should
know then that when the Lord <b>renders
reward to</b> his <b>servants</b>, it is
his own gifts that he rewards in them, for we could not have any work worthy of
reward if we had not received from him the ability to do works. Note also that
by the name of <b>prophets</b> are
represented the apostles. Meanwhile, let no one despair on account of their
imperfection, if they nonetheless strive to do perfect things but do not
succeed; because even the little ones shall obtain that reward; whence blessed
Job: <i>The small and great are there</i>.<b><sup>5</sup></b> <b>And shouldest banish<sup>6</sup> them who have corrupted the earth</b>.
They are said to be <b>banished</b> rather
than killed so as to show the everlasting exile of damnation, their eternal

The Latin word used here is usually translated here as « destroy », and that is
indeed how the Latin translator meant it, because it is what the word in the
original Greek means; but the Latin word can also mean « banish », and our
commentator interpreted it that way. Cf. note 2 on 9:11; it is the same Latin
verb (although the Greek it translates is a different synonym).</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

describes the battles of the Church with new symbols. What indeed does God's <b>temple</b> signify but Christ, in whom <i>all the</i> <i>fullness of the Godhead dwells corporeally</i>?<b><sup>1</sup></b> It is said to be <b>open</b>
because Christ has already been born, suffered, been resurrected, and been
elevated, and since it is in the Church that Christ is proclaimed to have done all
this, consequently he is said to <b>open
the temple in heaven</b>. <b>The ark of the
testament</b>, in which the power of the two Testaments was written by God's
finger, means the Church; according to Exodus, this ark has four golden rings
with bars through them to be carried on,<b><sup>2</sup></b>
that is the four Gospels through which the Church is governed by the holy
preachers. In it there is a golden pot with manna inside, that is the wisdom of
the divine Word with the food of life; and also Aaron's rod,<b><sup>3</sup></b> that is the proof of
kingly priesthood. <b>And there were
lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail</b>. <b>Lightnings</b> are miraculous signs, by which
the minds of the unfaithful were struck so that they submitted to humility;
whence the Psalmist: <i>Thou wilt multiply
lightnings, and trouble them</i>.<b><sup>4</sup></b>
It is appropriate for the <b>voices</b>,
that is the preachers, to come after the <b>lightnings</b>,
because, in order to bring the incredulous to faith by speaking, the preachers
first displayed new miracles. After words there follow <b>thunders </b>in order for those who despise <b>voices</b> to be shaken by terror of the judgment. Then <b>an earthquake</b>, that is persecution,
which is also indicated by <b>hail</b>; for
just as <b>hail</b> gets crushed as it
crushes the fruits of the earth, and the earth bears fruit again, when the
furious multitude of the Gentiles tried to take the name of God away from the earth,
it was itself reduced to naught, either by force or by being changed for the
better — for quite many of them came to Christ's faith. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The Latin word is usually translated here as « child », but « son » better
conveys the masculine character of the Latin word, which is what is under
discussion here. « Son » is the most literal and classical translation of the
word, but at a certain point Latin came to use it sometimes as « child ».</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Jer. 20:15. The Latin word used here can translate to either « child » or « boy
». So it is also masculine; it means a male child, albeit it can also be used
for any child in a « gender-unmarked », generalized manner, the masculine being
Latin's default gender for human beings — e.g. if you wanted to say in Latin
that someone had adopted a child, without yourself knowing the child's gender
or without wishing to specify it, you would use the masculine word for « child
», by default. All in all, the two expressions used in Rev. and Jer. for « man
child » do not sound quite as pleonastic in Latin as « man/male son » or «
man/male boy » do in English, but still enough for commentators to see
something in it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

The <b>woman's fleeing into the wilderness</b>
means the same as her son's being taken up to God; for the Church flees, not in
a physical ascent, but in a spiritual one. <b>The
wilderness</b> is the secret of the mind; for, in order to escape the serpent's
venom, holy men make themselves a desert by contemning all transitory and
fleshly desires. Note also that it is the duty of preachers to <b>feed</b> this <b>woman</b>. As for the place where she is fed, it is he to whom it is said,

these examples it is shown that neither do we fight without the angels' fighting,
nor do the <b>angels</b> without our

<b>Michael's</b> not because, as the
perfidy of some heretics would have it, he created them, but because he
received them from God as a help, or because it is believed that they are
soldiers under one king and from one city, in the same way as the <b>angels</b> who are demonstrated to belong

How can it be said that evil spirits <b>prevail

understand a part, over which the multitude of evil spirits cannot prevail to

English « devil » &lt; Latin <i>diabolus </i>&lt;
Greek διάβολος (diabolos), meaning « slandering » or « slanderer », derived
from the verb διαβάλλειν (diaballein), which means 1. to throw over or across,
2. to set at variance, 3. to slander. The verb διαβάλλειν is itself composed of
δια—, meaning« through » or « asunder », and βάλλειν, the basic meaning of
which is « to throw », but which can also mean « to throw oneself », « to fall
», notably with reference to a river; this is where the « flowing »
interpretation must come from.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Since the dragon falls from heaven to the earth every day, it is certain that
this <b>voice</b>, which is a desire of the
mind for praising, starts from the Lord's coming, and does not stop clamoring
in heaven, that is in the Church, until the end of the world. Therefore it is
all time that is included in the adverb <b>now</b>.
They say that <b>salvation is made</b> because
we have been saved by the free goodness of <b>God</b>;
<b>strength</b> because we have been strengthened
by it; and <b>power</b> because we have
been raised to a high glory. Indeed all these things have been made among men,
although not by man, but by Jesus <b>Christ</b>.
The Devil <b>accuses</b> people <b>day and night</b> when he takes care that
some be lifted up in success, and others broken in adversity. The Devil accuses
the saints not by speaking on the outside, but by listening on the inside; for
his evilness is his accusation of the saints.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

YORK. </span></b><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY IS THE ANGEL'S SIN CONCEALED IN
SILENCE IN GENESIS, WHILE MAN'S IS REVEALED? —<b> </b>Answer. Because God has
not predestined that he will cure the angel's wound, whereas he has predestined
that he will cure man's. [Question 3]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY WAS THE SIN OF THE HIGHEST ANGEL INCURABLE, AND THAT OF
MAN CURABLE? — Answer. Because the angel was the inventor of his own crime,
whereas man was seduced by another's deceit. Also, as much as the angel was
higher in glory, so much greater was his fall, whereas as much as man is weaker
in nature, so much easier is it for him to obtain forgiveness. <i>(Greg. Mor.
L. XXX, PL 76, col. 571.)</i> [Question 4]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY DID THE CREATOR WANT TO EXPIATE THE SIN OF MAN BY
HIMSELF AND NOT THROUGH AN ANGEL? — Answer. Because the merit of one angel did
not suffice for the redemption of all mankind, and the Devil would not have
committed so great a crime with the murder of an angel as he did with the
murder of the Creator. [Question 12]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY DID GOD ALLOW MAN TO BE TEMPTED, IF HE FOREKNEW THAT HE
WOULD AGREE TO THE SIN? — Answer. Because it would have been no great merit for
man not to have sinned if the reason he had not had been a lack of occasion to
do ill. Indeed, still today men throughout mankind are tempted without
intermission by the snares of the Devil, in order that the virtue of a person
tempted may be proven through this, and that the palm of the one who does not
agree to sin may appear the more glorious. [Question 61]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY WAS MAN MADE WITH FREE WILL? — Answer. Because the
Creator did not want to create man, whom he made in his own image, as anyone's
slave; he wanted him to prove worthy of praise for voluntary good or worthy of
damnation for evil desire. [Question 64]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHAT IS TRUE FREEDOM? — Answer. The greatest freedom is to

— It is no doubt, no doubt, that this world was created for man; although it is
composed of varied substances, it nevertheless forms but one body having
several members, the combined action of which is intended to produce all the
things necessary to man. It was like a house built for man with the provisions
he needed, provisions that the earth had to produce each according to its kind,
that is to say, that by the fact of their creation they had been able to
reproduce each according to its species. God created the primitive types whose
seed was to serve in turn the multiplication of species on earth. This is the
result of these words of the Scripture: "And God blessed them, saying, Be
multiplied and multiply on earth (Gen. 1:28)." He also blesses the human
race, and we see the same meaning reproduced in the book of the law. We read in
it: "The people grew and multiplied in Egypt (Acts 7:17).” The blessing
which God had given to the things he had created for the benefit of man was
also given to man, so that mankind grew and multiplied the union of man and
woman. And just as culture had to improve the seeds, so the human race had to
do all its care so that the knowledge of God would help her to lead her life,
to render pleasing to God and to relate all things to admiration and praise the
glory of his Creator. Whether it is the meaning of these words, the facts
themselves attest, for all things which have been created multiply and improve
upon the earth by the will of God. Indeed, one cannot suppose any other mode of
development than that which God has established for his seeds. How, then, can
we attribute an evil origin, or an illicit character, to that which develops
only under the influence of the blessings of God and of his will? The tradition
of this blessing has always remained in the synagogue and is still in use today
in the Church which consecrates by the blessing of God the union of its
creatures. And there is no presumption here on his part since the form of this
blessing comes from the Creator himself. If it is thought that this blessing
must cease one day, it can only be when the things which multiply under this
blessing cease to exist, for if the generation of men ceases, what would be the
usefulness of creatures who have received the blessing of God to multiply on
the earth? The world cannot be partly in action, partly in rest; or it acts
wholly, or it remains wholly in rest. What utility would be a body, some of
whose members would have life, while others would be struck with apathy? How
then do some go so far as to represent as profane and unclean the work which
has been consecrated by the blessing of God, except that they wish to attack
God Himself? They would find nothing to be recaptured in the work if the false
and evil ideas of the artisan were not formed. They do not dare openly to God,
they find the means of accusing him in his works. When the work displeases, the
blame falls on its author. If these critical spirits read or rather received
the Scriptures, they would recall the saying of Balaam: "Can I curse him
whom God has blessed (Num. 23:8)?” There is no charge against the approval of
the judge, and one condemns oneself when one wants to accuse as guilty the one
whom the laws themselves protect. Who, then, are you who believe that you can
condemn what God has blessed as the Scriptures teach you? You must either deny
that he is God, or that you should be contrary to Scripture. Indeed, it is
under the pretext that they receive the New Testament that they ought to reject
the ancient Scriptures. Now the new precepts which Jesus Christ imposes on the
faithful are not in contradiction with the ancients. The Savior himself has not
disdained to reply to the invitation which he was made to attend a wedding; and
not only did he honor them with his presence, but he even gave the spouses what
was lacking in the joy of the feast (Jn. 2:1), for it is written that wine
rejoices the heart of man (Ps. 103:15). And to show that he did nothing but the
will of his Father, the Jews having asked him whether it was permissible for a
man to return his father, He said to them, "From the beginning of the
world God made man and woman, and said unto them, For this cause a man shall
leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife, and they shall be
two in one flesh (Matt. 19:3-6). Therefore they are no longer two, but one
flesh. So let not man separate what God adds. This was why he gladly
surrendered to the invitation to attend the meetings, he would not appear to
condemn what God his Father had instituted. Wishing, on the contrary, to show the
harmony of the old law and of the new law, he not only did not proscribe
marriage, but deigned to honor it by his presence, to render him the testimony
of his divine institution, and by a most salutary commandment declared that
they should neither defend nor separate what God had united. It is also to
raise the utility of the birth of man, that on the point of leaving this world,
he confided his mother to his disciple John (Jn. 19:26). It is for the same
reason that the precepts of the old law and of the new law agree to recommend
that we honor our parents under pain of curses if we breach this commandment.
What then is this presumption, and on what law is it based to proscribe the
marriage so clearly authorized by the old as by the new law? We may apply to
him these words of the Savior: "That which is without is from evil (Matt.
5:37).” Thus the Apostle reproaches himself with having a cauterized conscience
to those men who forbid marriage, and the use of the foods that God created to
be eaten with actions of graces. (I Tim. 4:2.) It is an act on their part, both
of hypocrisy and of hostility, whose object is to accuse the law of which God
is the author. Others seem to receive the precepts of salvation with eagerness
only to support the prescriptions of their doctrine of falsehood, and this is
why the Apostle reproaches them for having a closed conscience. Indeed, the
corruption of their hearts makes them manifest outside feelings different from
what they think internally: they resemble the Jews who knew that the miracles
of the Savior were works of the Holy Spirit and that they did not say a feeling
of jealousy that it was in the name of Beelzebub that he cast out demons (Matt.
12:24, Lk. 11:15), to divert the people from believing in him. Such is also the
deceit of those of whom we have spoken; in the name of the holiness and
chastity with which they boast of being the partisans, they maintain that
marriage must be condemned, seeking to make itself valued and to divert the
people from truth; It is thus also that they recommend the abstinence of
certain foods to give themselves falsely as models of temperance which,
strangers to the world, hasten to reach the kingdom of heaven. After they have
thus seduced the spirits of men, they preach the legitimacy of the most
reprehensible acts and condemn the use of permissible things. Such are the
wiles of Satan, he inverts the roles and in the form of a novelty he excludes
truth which is nothing new because it is wholly eternal. Who does not notice
that such is the conduct adopted by our enemies? Who, moreover, would dare to
condemn a divine institution which has never been injurious to anyone but the
enemy of truth? In order to cover his disorders, he preaches the sanctity which
he dislikes, and when he has thus become a zealous supporter of good, he
teaches that the most culpable acts are permitted. It makes itself worth to
deceive more easily and to suggest to the imprudent ones who fall into its
traps more enormous sins. It is a remedy, it seems to his own evils, to incite
men to excess crimes; he regards it as a great consolation to have many
accomplices, and regards his punishment as lighter and more tolerable if he
succeeds in drawing a large number with him into hell blind men who are
overcome by their vices excuse themselves for their weakness or ignorance, and
do not think of punishing the faults on which concupiscence deceives them. Or
what is this cloud that conceals from them the knowledge of truth? For the
letters appear to have a different signification, when they are badly
pronounced, or are not properly distinguished; but when one reads: God has
done, and again: God has blessed what he has done, can it remain matter either
to the discussion or to the slightest doubt? Who will dare to see the curse
instead of the blessing, unless animated by a hostile spirit? If these words
were the words of man, perhaps one might fear some ploy, but it is God who
speaks, and you doubt? It is God blessed, and you condemn? But was not Moses
under the name of God the author of this error? The miracles and wonders which
Moses made in Egypt are an answer to this question, and the wonders he has done
in the Red Sea for the deliverance of the children of Israel must suffice to
persuade you. Listen to the confession made by the magicians: "The finger
of God is here (Exod. 8:19).” Believe in the testimony of the Apostle, who said
to you, "I do not want you to be ignorant, my brothers, that our fathers
were all under the cloud, that they all passed through and they were all baptized
under the guidance of Moses in the cloud and in the sea, that they all ate the
same mysterious meat, and that they drank the same mysterious drink, for they
drank the water of the spiritual stone, the water which followed them, and this
stone was Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 10:1, 4).” And how did the Apostle speak in this
way? The answer is in the Scriptures, where we read that Our Lord Jesus Christ
said to the Jews, "If you believed in Moses, you would doubtless believe
me too, for it is from me that he wrote (Jn. 5:46)." Who could not believe
in such a beautiful harmony, who would dare to see contradiction in such a
perfect unity, who would be badly inspired to accuse of hostility so close a
union? The testimony of the words, and the examples of the miracles which must
submit your mind to the truth, and prevent you from considering as true any
doctrine which is not contained in the books of the Catholic Church of the Old
Testament is the same as ours, and that a thousand brilliant signs proclaim
that it is the only true one, its authority must be so great to us that even if
a thing should appear to us too harsh or even absurd, accept, reform on this
our personal ideas before the judgment of God who apprehends it, for we must
believe in God rather than ourselves. Indeed, our weakness and inexperience
often regard as useful what is most injurious to us, and takes the false for
truth, which we cannot even suspect of God; its nature is inaccessible to
error; it is not permissible for us to doubt the legitimacy of marriage before
these words of God: "Let not man divide what God has united (Matt. 19:6:
Mk. 10:9).” This is a thing as clear as it is simple. It is certain that every
man has reason to rejoice at having been the object of the goodness of God, and
that he thinks he is better when he learns to know the sacrament of his
Creator, which he would not be able to achieve if he had not been born. Why,
then, deplore what makes the subject of his joy, and condemn what he glories of
having learned?<span>  </span>If he rejoices at having
learned, and if, moreover, he could not learn unless he was born; no doubt it
is good to be born, since the fruit of birth is the knowledge of the truth. If,
on the contrary, it is an evil to be born, knowledge cannot be good. To what
purpose can this knowledge be used if the birth is condemned? If it is neither
useful nor necessary to be born, why should he who is condemned seek to learn?
But as there is no mind stupid enough to deny that knowledge of God is useful
to men, it is necessary to recognize its goodness, its utility. It is she who
adds a new perfection to birth, so that she deserves more than Adam had
received, for it is in heaven and not on earth that the faithful are called to
reign, the paradise of God the Father, and not in that where Adam had been
ordered to engage in bodily labor. In Jerusalem there was celebrated the feast
called encaenia, that is to say, the dedication of the temple of God, how much
more must we celebrate the birth of man, who is much more appropriately called
the temple of God, and who has himself constructed with his hands to God the
temples to give him thanksgiving? Our body is a much more excellent temple,
because it is the work of God, and the material temples are the work of man,
that one has the hope of eternity, while the others are destined for a certain
ruin. He who acknowledges that it was God who gave birth to him to give thanks,
and who has come to know his mysteries, must rejoice on the anniversary of his
birth by seeing the precious fruits which he has produced. As for those who
abandon their Creator and offer to others the glory which is due to them, it
would have been better for them never to be born, for their birth can only turn
to their misfortune, and yet the fault is not with birth, but to their will.
But who are you, you who pretend to forbid marriage? You may be, Marcion, who
maintain that the body is not the work of God but of the devil, and that it is
in consequence of some fault that the soul fell from its first state descended
into this region of darkness where the world is. Now how could it attain its
deliverance if the generation is forbidden to it? It is after your birth that
you experienced your downfall and that you have taken the means to return to
the fatherland and resume your original destiny. You give thanks to Jesus
Christ, by whom you are glad to have obtained this knowledge. Now, if you were
not born, all knowledge would have been impossible, and consequently all
deliverance. If you rejoice in the deliverance of your soul, be favorable to your
birth, for if you condemn it, you are the enemy of souls. Or are you a
Manichean, who rejects the marriages as evil? I will then ask you if there was
no generation of bodies, how could the soul, which you say is spread in a dark
region and closely united to the material elements, be delivered? The book you
wrote say that it is by birth that the soul is delivered, that is to say that
the souls received by the moon are coming out of their bodies transmitted to
the sun which you claim to be the God of your souls. And is it not fortunate
for you to bear the name of Manicheans? Indeed, it is in this capacity that you
solicit your deliverance, which you would not know if you were not born. It is
therefore evident that you condemn marriage by hypocrisy. You make an outward
profession of chastity, and you give yourself up in secret to all kinds of
impurities, which have not been hidden, but which have been revealed by the
very edicts of the emperors. Listen now, you who are a Catholic, and learn from
the Gospel how useful it is to the man of valor. When the righteous Simeon
wished to leave this life, convinced that it was enough for him to know his
Creator without knowing the mystery of his incarnation, God did not accede to
his desire until he had arrived at this perfect state for to obtain the full
and entire reward of his faith. It was then that he took in his arms the Savior
who had just been born and blessed God in these terms: "Lord, you will now
let your servant go in peace according to your word, for my eyes have seen your
salvation (Lk. 2:29).” It was clear to God that it was good for man to be born,
since it was answered to that righteous man who desired death that he would not
die before he had seen the Christ of the Lord; for he had made such great progress
here below, that he was worthy to see in this life the man he hoped for as his
deliverer after his death. Now, how can we say that birth was not a useful
thing for this man to whom God extended his life and allowed him to die only
when he had seen the fruit of his hope, and which he would be sure to see for
himself life to succeed him? If it were an evil for us to be born, it is
neither paradise, nor eternal life, nor the kingdom of heaven promised us, but
the punishments and chastisements of hell that we should expect. The man who
knew that he was born for his loss would fear to transmit life to another, and
he who knew that his birth was a guilty act would not seek to revive in his
children. They will say to me, "Yes, the kingdom of heaven is promised, but
to the faithful men who have done good." Perfectly, therefore, you see
that men are not guilty by the sole fact of their birth, but because they have
done evil; for it is not to those who are not born that the kingdom of heaven
is promised, which would make birth a cause of exclusion, but to those who
after their birth do good; that is to say, birth cannot be useful to the child
he that does evil, and hurts him that does good. The faithful and the good men
add to the perfection of their birth, the infidels and the unbelievers make
their lose her. Birth is like a tree that is grafted; if the graft is good, the
tree will become better and be called a good tree; if the graft is bad, it will
become worse than it was and deserve to be called a bad tree. Thus, if a sound
doctrine is joined at birth, it will produce good fruits, but if the doctrine
is bad, the fruits will be equally bad. Just as the tree must exist beforehand
so that it can be grafted, birth is also necessary in order to make progress
good. But we are made of this body: If it is good and useful to be born, why do
we need to be reborn? This rebirth would not take place if birth was not
useful. The soul is to be renewed, and those that are renewed are completely
repaired. This rebirth is not, therefore, opposed to birth, it is reform, and
what is reformed proves by the same the perfection of its first state. This
rebirth is a transformation which is the effect of a voluntary resolution, and
which purifies the defilements of the body to restore us to the primitive state
in which Adam was created. The soul has communicated to the body the
defilements of his sin, but faith repairs it, renders it more perfect and
cleanses it in the waters of baptism; the contempt of God had tainted him,
obedience purified him, he thus avoided the sentence pronounced against Adam
and acquired the right to the glorious resurrection. If, then, it is by the
soul that sin began, why should we accuse the nature of the body, since in the
sin of Adam it is not the body that has desired, but the soul seduced by hope
of the divinity, who transgressed the precept, cast the body into the bondage
of sin, and condemned all men to be born slaves to sin? Now this sin does not
harm the man who obeys the law of God, except that he is subject to death; but
here again the goodness of God has promised him a reward proportionate with
that punishment, that is, those who will be found faithful to their Creator,
and whom the sins of Adam condemn to corruption and death, will receive in
return from the righteous judge more than God had granted to Adam; they will be
covered with glory in heaven and will possess eternal life, and will be called
the adopted sons of God, so that it is truly a gain for them to be born. I now
follow the passage from which we read: "God said to man, You may eat of
all the fruit of the garden, but you do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil (Gen. 2:16-17).” All the trees of which God speaks here are the
fruits destined to be made the food of the creatures. They are given here the
general name of trees, but there is a great variety in the fruits. They are
all, however, trees and plants, and there is only one kind of food in spite of
the diversity of fruits used to the food of man. When God had created this multitude
of fruit trees for the nourishment of man, he forbade him, as I have said, to
eat the fruit of a single tree. As our first parents had been empowered over
all things, it was fitting that they should give God on one point a testimony
of submission and respect. He had therefore reserved a single tree to which he
had forbidden them to touch, to remind them of their condition. How can the
sentence pronounced against them make us understand what was the nature of
their fault? This sentence, in fact, can be pronounced both against a homicide,
against a malefactor, an adulteress, an infamous one. (Josh. 17:1, etc.). How,
then, to judge according to this sentence of the nature of sin, is to be
condemned after his sin to be consumed by fire, and all his family. It can be
assumed that sin was great, but not what its nature was, for we know that
others were condemned to the same punishment, although their fault was
different. Amorites and the inhabitants of Sodom perished, and their children,
and we see men guilty of the same crime, punished with various punishments,
with one and the same sentence pronounced against those whose crimes are quite
different, and of Eve cannot be known by the sentence pronounced against them.
The sin of man and woman is the same, it is true, yet both were condemned to a
particular and individual punishment, as was the serpent. Not only did they not
preserve the prerogatives of their former state, but God imposed upon them
labor as the punishment of their crime. God, as the book of Genesis tells us,
had subjected all animals and all living beings to man (Gen. 1:26). The serpent
rose up against this order, and so much by his cunning and his artifices that
he enslaved man to his empire. No doubt, indeed, he who makes someone fall into
his traps, submits him to his dominion. But God did not wish that he should
receive the fruits of his deceit; he humbled and shamed him below his first
condition, that he might not rise above man, leaves him only the pain, not only
of not having succeeded in his designs, but of having lost the perfection of
his creation. It was, says the sacred author, the most of all the animals God
had placed on earth; but after he had deceived the man, he was cursed among all
the beasts and creatures of the earth. After the sentence pronounced against
man, against woman, against the serpent, the woman, who had been the accomplice
of man in contempt of the divine command, was to be subjected to a particular
punishment. God said to her, "I will multiply your calamities, your childbirth,
you will give birth in sorrow, your desires will turn to your husband, and he
will rule over you (Gen. 3:16.).” No one confirms himself what he condemns. If
children were granted to the woman because she had united herself to the man
against the order of God, then a guilty act must be recognized as having
wonderful effects. But if you believe that the principle of the generation of
men is in these words: "You will be grieved in sorrow," what did
these words mean: "Increase and multiply”? This sentence, "Ye shall
bear in sorrow," is therefore only a punishment, that is to say, that what
had previously been granted to him as a cause of joy will become a sin source
of sorrows; and that this punishment should cease to weigh upon the woman, God
adds that her desires will turn to her husband, and will be for her a principle
of ever-new sorrows. If God condemned the union of man and woman, why did he
say to her: "Will your desires turn to your husband?” No one establishes
as punishment what he condemns as reprehensible, since punishment must always
be opposed to the crime he punishes, and that it must come from a very
different principle. If the fault and the punishment come from the same
principle, no one would be afraid of being condemned. One might even say that
the transgression of the law becomes a laudable act. Far from punishing sin,
God would have confirmed it, if the desires of the woman had turned to her
husband only because of her sin. But no, the truth is that this union of woman
with man, which had been merely permissible before sin, was then imposed upon
her with the bondage of childbirth as a punishment, because man had been left
to rule by the woman whom God had given her as companion. It is evident that he
had been subject by the woman whose counsels had led her to believe in the
hopes she had given him, and which were intended only to destroy the work of
God by the ploys of the devil. God, by his sentence, therefore returns the wife
to the condition of subjugation which subjects her to her husband, according to
the first institution, and adds, as a punishment: "I will multiply your
calamities and your movements; you will turn to your husband, and he will rule
over you." Had God established the woman in a state which was not a state
of submission to her husband? The woman is therefore recalled here to this
first state with the addition we have pointed out. That is why God said to her,
"I will set the height of your sorrows and your groans.” Putting the end
is adding to what is incomplete, not establishing or doing what does not. The
words of God that precede: "Rise and multiply," (Gen. 1:22, 28) are
not for creation but for the loss of creatures to whom God conceded existence.
After sin, God adds to the pain and difficulties of woman's birth, but does not
establish a new form of procreation. If these words have really been the
principle of generation, it must be attributed rather to the will of the devil
than to that of the Lord, for there is, as the Savior declares, a race of
vipers. (Matt. 3:7) Now, if anyone thinks he was born in this way, let him
consider what he deserved. It was because of her sin that she saw the pangs of
childbirth increase, and that this grief, which was at first sight, increased
in punishment for the sins of her children; for it is in the groans and tears
that she gives birth to them, and scarcely have they been born, that they
become for her a permanent cause of sadness. Thirdly, let us see the sentence
pronounced against the man: "Because you have listened to your wife's voice,
and have eaten the fruit of the tree which I have forbidden you to eat, the
earth will be cursed because of what you have done, and you will not eat of its
fruits, in all the days of your life but with great labor, it will produce for
you only thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18).” Adam is also recalled to the
state in which he was created, but with a decrease of his privileges. God had
first placed him in the earthly paradise to simply cultivate the earth and see
at once the fruit of his work. But scarcely has he despised the divine
commandment, in the hope of finding in the council of the serpent a fate more
fortunate than that which God had given him, God recalls him to his first
condition, but by adding to it sweat and fatigue; the earth will no longer
respond to his labors, it will be cursed not for it, but because of its works.
God thus shows that His designs cannot be destroyed and that no one can show
greater providence. No one, in fact, can love the work of another more strongly
than the one who is the author of it, to the apostle's testimony: "Never
has anyone hated his own flesh; nourishes and cares for her, like Jesus Christ
the Church (Eph. 5:29).” Let us now see whether the continuation of the
historical facts of the law agrees with its beginnings. Abraham having been
pleasing to God, among other rewards of his faith, was judged worthy to beget a
son in his old age. How, then, can we attack and condemn what God grants as a
reward? That is to say, that Abraham having obeyed the divine will, sees God
fulfill his own will, which could not have been done if this will was not
innocent, for God would not have granted a request or bad or unintelligent,
especially in with respect to him who was pleasing to him; a man himself would
not act in this way. A man who was barren and loved God with all his heart,
asked for a son and obtained it. Now, if this request were guilty, the God whom
he loved should have warned him not to make a request contrary to the good. (I
Kgs. 1:2) Samuel, his son, of such eminent sanctity, had children in his turn,
but the merit of his justice was not diminished. On the contrary, his virtue
never ceased to increase since his first years, and he received from God in his
old age the most striking testimony. The priest Zechariah, a righteous man,
also had in his old age, by the will of God, a son who had the gift of prophecy
even before his birth (Lk. 1:5). What is the reason why we are accused of what
everyone agrees to present as advantageous? How can one deny that one must call
good and useful something that does not harm anyone? And to speak here a little
of the apostles and to make them serve for the direct defense of this cause,
St. John was certainly a faithful observer of chastity; but we know that his
colleague in the apostolate, that is, St. Peter, had a wife, and that the
children she gave him were not an obstacle to the primacy he received from the
other apostles. How then can we condemn what can be reconciled with the
greatest merits? Thus the apostle St. Paul teaches that he who has a wife, if
he observes the commandments, can and must be raised to the priesthood. If
marriage were unlawful, he would not have declared that a sinner should receive
the priesthood. And what is more evident? Is it not the same Apostle who says:
"As for the virgins, I have not received a commandment from the Lord (1
Cor. 7:25)?” The heretics notice trouble and agitation among the Corinthians,
by hypocritically teaching that marriage should be condemned; they therefore
consulted the Apostle by letters, to ascertain whether it was lawful to marry,
or whether to send his wife away. It is then that St. Paul commands the woman
not to separate herself from her husband, although it would have been the
occasion, if he had been convinced that this was the true doctrine, to say that
it was forbidden to marry, just as he declares that he cannot impose as a
precept what he has received no command from the Lord. Who, on the contrary,
does not hear him preach loudly: ‘I want young widows to marry and have children?’
But, I am told, if it is lawful, if it is advantageous to marry, why is it not
permissible for priests to have their wives, that is to say, why is it
forbidden for them to have relations with her after their ordination? Who knows
that each state has its own laws? There are things that are generally
prohibited at all; there are some who are permitted to one and forbidden to
others; there are some which are sometimes defended and sometimes permitted.
Fornication is forbidden to all without exception; but trade is sometimes
permitted and sometimes defended. Before entering the ecclesiastical state, a
man is permitted to trade, but he can no longer do so as soon as he is a part
of it. In the same way, it is sometimes permissible, sometimes forbidden for a
Christian to have relations with his wife. Thus, in the days of public
supplication, it is his duty to separate from his wife, because he must abstain
even from the things permitted to obtain more easily what he asks of God. For
this reason the Apostle recommends abstaining for one time from the use of the
marriage of the consent of one and the other, in order to attend to prayer.
According to the law, wars and lawsuits are prohibited on fasting days, and are
permitted on other days to show greater respect for the things of God. Is all
that is permitted before other men equally before the person of the sovereign?
How much more must we observe this rule in the things of God? The priest
consecrated to him must therefore be purer than other men; he represents him,
he is his vicar, and what is permitted to others is forbidden to him, because
he must fulfill every day the functions of Jesus Christ himself, that is to say
pray for the people, offer the sacrifice, or administer baptism. It is not only
to the priest that the use of marriage is forbidden, but also to his minister,
for he must be all the purer as the mysteries of which he is the minister are
more holy. Just as in the presence of a torch darkness appears not only
obscure, but hideous, as compared with the stars the flame itself loses its
brightness, the stars compared to the sun become dark, the sun compared to God
is more than a dark night; thus things which are lawful and pure to us become
illicit and impure in the presence of the dignity of God, for all the good they
are, they are not suitable to the divine majesty. Would not the tunic of an
obscure man, no matter how clean, be a scoundrel unbecoming the person of the
emperor? Is it not the same with the tunic of the Saxons for a senator? For the
same reason the priests of God must be more chaste than other men, because they

by his nature is light itself, demands that his ministers be pure in their
conscience rather than in their garments; to him praise and glory for ever and

utterance to the words of God, for God had already said: ‘From every tree of
the garden you may eat, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you
must not eat, for the day you eat of it you must die. (Gen. 2:16) The serpent
inserted a falsehood in questioning the woman thus: ‘Did God say, you shall not
eat of any tree?’ Whereas God had actually said: From every tree of the garden
you may eat, but from one tree you must not eat, meaning, by that, the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil which was not to be tasted. We need not wonder
at the manner of deception. Deceit accompanies any effort at ensnaring an
individual. The serpent’s question was not without its purpose. But the woman’s
reply will indicate that there was nothing questionable in the command of God:
‘Of the fruit of all the trees in the garden we may eat, but of the fruit of
the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, you shall not eat of it neither
shall you touch it, lest you die.’ There was nothing inexact about the command
itself. The error lay in the report of the command. The Scriptural passage
under discussion is self-explanatory. We realize that we ought not to make any
addition to a command even by way of instruction. Any addition or qualification
of a command is in the nature of a falsification. The simple, original form of
a command should be preserved or the facts should be duly set before us. It
frequently happens that a witness adds something of himself to a relation of
facts. In this way, by the injection of an untruth, confidence in his testimony
is wholly shattered. No addition therefore–not even a good one–is called for.
What is, therefore, at first sight objectionable in the addition made by the
woman: ‘Neither shall you touch anything of it’? God did not say this, but,
rather: ‘you must not eat.’ Still, we have here something which leads to error.
There are two possibilities to the addition she made: Either it is superfluous
or because of this personal contribution she has made God’s command only partly
intelligible. John in his writings has made this clear: ‘If anyone shall add to
them, God will add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if
anyone shall take away from these words of the book of this prophecy, God will
take away his portion from the tree of life.’ (Rev. 22:18,19) If this is true
in this case, how much truer is it that nothing should be taken away from the
commands laid down by God! From this springs the primary violation of the command.
And many believe that this was Adam’s fault-not the woman’s. They reason that
Adam in his desire to make her more cautious had said to the woman that God had
given the additional instruction: ‘Neither shall you touch it.’ We know that it
was not Eve, but Adam, who received the command from God, because the woman had
not yet been created. Scripture does not reveal the exact words that Adam used
when he disclosed to her the nature and content of the command. At all events,
we understand that the substance of the command was given to the woman by the
man. What opinions others have offered on this subject should be taken into
consideration. It seems to me, however, that the initial violation and deceit
was due to the woman. Although there may appear to be an element of uncertainty
in deciding which of the two was guilty, we can discern the sex which was
liable first to do wrong. <b>[On Paradise

3:1) <a name="_Hlk519957406"><font color="#000000">IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS A SERPENT WHO SPOKE WITH
THE WOMAN, OR IS IT THE VERY ACT OF THE DEVIL WHO HAS SEDUCED IT, WHO HAS GIVEN
ITS THE NAME OF SERPENT? </font></a>— If we keep to the historical narrative, it is
true that the serpent was the finest of all the animals that the Lord God had
formed on earth. Besides, it is against the serpent that God has pronounced his
sentence. What, indeed, would it be astonishing that the devil was finer than
the animals, the Apostle of whom said, "Do you not know the depths of
Satan (2 Cor. 2:11)?” Another proof that it was a true serpent is that God said
to him, "You shall crawl on your stomach, and you shall eat of the earth
all the days of your life (Gen. 3:14).” This punishment is in no way suited to
the nature of Satan, since he is neither clothed in body nor subject to death.
If we examine things more closely, we shall see that this sentence did not
aggravate the condition of the serpent, and that it was condemned to remain in
the state in which God had created it. He had been the instrument of Satan to
subdue the man to whom God had subjected everything; for this reason God
represses the pride of the serpent by that subjugation in which he had placed
all creatures before man, because he had been a minister of pride to man. The
man appeared to have submitted to the serpent, following the advice which he
gave him of transgressing the law which he had imposed upon him. The Lord
Himself testifies to the prudence of serpents, when he says, "Be careful
as serpents (Matt. 10:16)." It is therefore well established that the
serpent truly spoke with Eve; it now remains for us to examine whether he has
been sufficiently sly and cunning enough to deceive her. For if it were finer
than other animals, it could be no more than men, since no animal is endowed
with reason, except man. It is impossible, therefore, that the serpent should
be the author of these subtle insinuations; let him be in good health, but his
finesse cannot go beyond his nature. It cannot deliberate, reflect, or take
advice. It is therefore certain that it was the devil, who in the form of the
serpent, sought to seduce the woman. By slipping into the form of the serpent,
he used it as an instrument, so that the woman, who knew the serpent's
fineness, could not suspect the cunning of the demon hiding in this form. Hence
the sentence of condemnation carried out against the serpent, falls spiritually
upon Satan, because the sentence must reach the true culprit. This sentence
does not come from man, who by error or malice might condemn an ​​innocent man;
it comes from God who is infallible, and whose judgment reaches only the one
guilty. Satan, though invisible, makes his snares outwardly; the sentence of
condemnation is pronounced externally, but it falls spiritually upon him whose
crime has necessitated the sentence. Indeed, Satan, that audacious and impure
spirit, has been thrown from the sacred dwelling of heaven and condemned to
crawl and groan on earth. I may be asked in what language the serpent spoke to
the woman; I answer, in the language of the serpent. If there are any, who now
understand the signification of the barking of dogs, the howling of wolves, the
cries of elephants, the chanting of cocks, why the woman who then had no less
intelligence, could not she have understood the snake's throat, when we know
many who understand the signification of the song of the birds? It is certain
that the devil used the tongue of the one in whose body he had entered,
otherwise he could not have deceived the woman. He therefore spoke the language
of the serpent which he had chosen as his instrument. <b>[Questions on the Old and New Testament]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Now, "the serpent was the most prudent," unquestionably "of all
the animals that were on the earth, and which the Lord God had made.” The word
prudence, or wisdom, according to the Latin version of some manuscripts, is
used here by extension: it can not be taken in its own right and on the other
hand, as happens when one applies it to God, to angels, to the reasonable soul:
so much would then be wise to call the bees or even the ants, whose works offer
a semblance of wisdom. However, to consider in the serpent, not the animal
without reason, but the spirit of Satan who had intro, shine, we can call you
the wisest of animals. So low indeed as the rebellious angels have fallen,
precipitated from the celestial heights by their pride, they preserve not less
by the privilege of reason the superiority over all the animals. What would be
surprising then if the devil, by communicating his inspiration to the serpent
and animating it with his genius, as he does to the diviners who are
consecrated to him, would have made this animal the wisest of beings who have
here below, life without reason! However the word wisdom can not apply to one.
wicked only by abuse; it is as if one were saying of the good man that he is
cunning. Now, in our language, the word wisdom always contains a eulogy, that
of cunning implies the perversity of the heart. Hence it is that in several
Latin editions, where the propriety of the language has been consulted, we have
become attached to meaning rather than expression, and we have preferred to
call the most cunning serpent of animals. As for the precise meaning of the
Hebrew word, those who are fully conversant with this language will examine
whether it can rigorously and without impropriety designate wisdom in evil.
Scripture offers us this meaning in another passage (Jeremiah IV, 22), and the
Lord says that the children of the age are dirtier than the children of light
in the conduct of their affairs, though they employ fraud and not justice
(Luke, XVI, 8).</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the devil has chosen the serpent to tempt man and commit him to sin; his
perverse and jealous desire inspired him with the desire to deceive, but he
could not execute his designs except through the medium of the animal whose
face God had allowed him to take. The guilty intention depends on the will of
the beings; as to being able to realize it, it comes from God, who only grants
it by a mysterious judgment of his deep justice, while remaining himself
inaccessible to iniquity (Romans III, 5).</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

have succeeded in triumphing over the man, if he had not previously let himself
be carried away by a movement of pride, which had to be repressed in order to
make him feel by the humiliation of his fault how much he had been wrong to
presume on his own. For truth itself expresses itself like this. "The
heart is exalted before the fall, it humbles itself before glory (Prov.xvi,
18). Perhaps we find the accent of this sinner in these words of the Psalmist:
"When I was in prosperity, I said:" I will never be shaken. But,
after having experienced the fatal effects of pride, who is intoxicated with
his power, and felt the benefits of divine protection, he exclaims: "Lord,
it was out of pure goodness that you had me. established in this flourishing
state; you have hidden your face, and I have been utterly bewildered (Ps. XXIX,
7, 8). "But whatever the personage in question, it was necessary to teach
the soul a lesson who exalts himself and relies too much on his own strength,
and makes him feel, by the sad consequences of sin, all the misfortune which
awaits the creature, when it separates itself from the Creator. We discover
better that God is the sovereign good, sending that far from him there is no
good: for those who taste the mortal poison of pleasure can not help but fear
the severity of punishment; as for those who, all stunned by pride, no longer
feel how desperate their desertion is, they are still more unhappy than those
who are conscious of their condition: repulsing the remedy which would cure
them of their errors, they do not to serve as an example to others to inspire
them with disgust. "Everyone is tempted," says the Apostle James,
"by the attraction and the beginnings of his own lust. When concupiscence
has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and sin, being consumed, causes death”
(James 1:14-15). But, the swelling of pride healed, one is reborn to life,
when, after the ordeal, one finds, to return to God, the will that had failed
before trial to remain faithful to it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">WHY HAS GOD ALLOWED
TEMPTATION? It is sometimes astonished that God allowed the first man to be
tempted: but do not we see that even today the human race is. constantly facing
the tricks of the devil? Why does God allow it? Is it not to put virtue to the
test? Is it not a triumph more glorious to resist temptation than to be exempt
from the possibility of being tempted? Even those who renounce the Creator to
follow in the footsteps of the tempter, only multiply the temptations for the
faithful souls, at the same time that they take away from them the desire to
flee with them, and inspire them with a salutary fear. of pride. Hence the word
of the Apostle: "Looking to yourself, lest you also be tempted (Gal. VI, 1).
For the humility which binds us to the Creator, and which prevents us from
presuming enough of our strength to believe, that we can do without his help,
is recommended to us throughout the whole of Scripture with striking attention.
Then, then, that pious and just souls are perfected by the very example of
impiety and injustice, we are no longer justified in saying that God should not
have created the men whose existence he foresaw criminal. Why not create them,
since they must serve, as God has foreseen, to test, to keep the right hearts
awake, and that besides they must suffer the punishment that their bad will
deserves?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

CREATED WITH THE WILL TO NEVER PLEASE? Well! One adds, God had to create man by
giving him the will never to sin. Either I grant that a being incapable of
consenting to sin is more perfect; but I must be allowed at the same time that
a created being can not be called evil, with the faculty of never sinning, if
he will, nor finding it unjust, that he be punished, since he has sinned by
choice and not out of necessity. If, then, reason clearly demonstrates the
superiority of a being who experiences only legitimate desires, it also clearly
demonstrates the relative excellence of a being who has the power to subdue
guilty desires, and to be sensitive to joy that accompanies, not only the
permitted acts, but also the victory over a disorderly passion. Of these two
beings, one is good, the other is better: why would God have created only the
latter, instead of creating them both? Those who are willing to praise the
first creation, must find in both a subject of praise even richer. The holy
angels represent the first, the holy men, the second: As for those who chose
the cause of iniquity, and who corrupted by a guilty will the benefits of their
nature, God was not obliged not to create them, by that alone that he foresaw
their existence. They too have their role in the world and they fill it for the
sake of the saints. As for God, if he can do without the virtues of the
righteous man, much less does he not need the vices of the corrupted man.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WICKED WHILE PREDICTING THEIR MALICE? Who would dare to say in cold blood: God
would have done better not to create those to whom the malice of others was to
serve as a salutary example, than to create with them the wretches whom their
iniquity was to lead to damnation; because he knows everything eternally? This
reasoning, in fact, amounts to saying that it would be better to have refused
existence to him who, taking advantage of the faults of others, receives by
divine grace the immortal crown, than to have given it to the wicked at whose
faults attract a just punishment. Now, when invincible reasoning proves that
two goods are not equal among themselves, and that one is more perfect than the
other, the unphilosophical minds wish to identify them, without perceiving that
they are cutting off one; consequently, they diminish the number of goods, by
confounding their varieties: the exaggerated importance they give to one
species causes them to suppress the other, which might prevent themselves from
exploding, if they came to say seriously : The sight is greater than hearing:
so the man should have four eyes and no ears? Well ! being established that
there is an intelligent creature submitted to God, without fear of pride or
punishment, while the human creature needs, in order to appreciate the benefits
of God, "so as not to swell with pride and to live in fear (Rom. xi, 20),
"to see the punishment; Is he a sensible man who wishes to confound these
two classes of beings, without perceiving immediately that he suppresses the
second and preserves only the first? Such reasoning would imply an absolute
lack of logic and common sense. Therefore, why should not God have created the
men of whom he foresaw the mischief "if, wishing to show his righteous
anger and to burst his power, he allowed the vases of anger that were prepared
for destruction to remain in his great patience? in order to show all the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he has prepared for his glory
(Ibid., 22, 23)? It is for this reason that the one who glorifies himself
glorifies himself in the Lord (II Corinthians X, 17): »he indeed recognizes
that it is not of him, but of the Lord, that depend both on his to be and his

his prescience is infallible, it is their will, and not his, that is bad. Why
did he create them, knowing in advance their malice? Because he foresaw
everything wrong that they would do and the advantage that the righteous would

to say that the devil has thought of offering us a symbol for our instruction;

could he employ any other means than that which was permitted him? Therefore,

Providence, which dominates even the passion that the devil has to harm. As for
the power to do evil, it is only granted to break and lose the vessels of
wrath, or to humble and put to the test the vessels of mercy. We already know
what is the origin of the snake; the earth produced, at the command of God,
domestic animals, beasts, and reptiles; Now every creature, having life without
reason, has been subordinated by a law of the divine order to intelligent

of the devil; for all the more reason was the serpent incapable of
understanding the words of which the devil formed the sounds in him and by his
organ, he who would be incapable of understanding the words of a man, if he
came to listen to him without being possesses. We imagine that snakes listen to
and understand the magical formulas of the Marses, who succeed by their
enchantment in bringing them out of their retreats; but all these movements
have the devil for cause and make all together recognize the natural role that
Providence has assigned to beings and the one that can make them play, with his
very wise permission, a malicious will. This is how the snake has become the
most sensitive of all animals to the operations of magic. This fact is a
considerable proof that the human species has been primitively seduced by an
interview with the serpent. Demons applaud themselves for being powerful enough
to move serpents in incantations; it is a means for them to deceive. But, if
God gives them this power, it is to recall the primitive temptation by the very
trade they continue to maintain with this species of animals. If even the
primitive temptation was permitted, it was to offer the man, to whom this event
was to be told for his instruction, an image of all the seductions of the devil
under the figure of the serpent: this point will clear up when we arrive to the
curse that God made fall on this beast.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

If the serpent has been called the most prudent, that is to say, the most
cunning of all animals, he owes this epithet to the very cunning of the demon
who had made it an instrument to triumph. the same title, fine and cunning the
language used by a fine and crafty spirit to seduce. These qualities, in fact,
do not belong to the organ called language, but to the intelligence that makes
it move. It is. by the same figure that is described as lying the pen of a
writer; the lie supposes an animated and reasonable being, but as the pen is
the instrument of the lie, it is called lying. In the same way, we could call
the snake, which has become the hand of the devil, like a pen in the hands of a
writer without faith, an instrument of falsehood.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to silence these observations, in order to prevent the spirits from believing
that animals without reason can ever acquire the gift of human reason, or
conversely that a reasonable being may suddenly be transformed into a beast;
and thus to remove them from the ridiculous and criminal opinion that the souls
of animals pass into the bodies of men or the souls of men into the bodies of
animals. The serpent spoke to the man, as did the ass on which Balaam was
mounted (Num. XXII, 28); with this difference that one was the organ of the
devil and the other an angel. The works of good and bad angels are sometimes
similar, like those of Moses and the magicians of Pharaoh (Exod VII, 10, 11),
but here again the good angels have a higher power, or rather the bad angels
can not produce these effects, as much as God allows them through the good
angels, so that each one receives a salary commensurate with his intentions or
the grace of God, always just, always good, "in the abyss of the treasures
of his wisdom (Rom XI, 33)."</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

SERPENT WITH THE WOMAN. The snake said to the woman, "What! why did God
say to you, You will not eat of all the trees that are in Paradise? The woman
answered the serpent: We eat of the fruit of every tree that is in Paradise; As
for the tree in the middle, God said to us, You will not touch it, and you will
not eat it, or you will die. Thus the serpent addressed himself first to the
woman, who gave him this answer; so that her fault was without excuse, and it
could not be said that she had forgotten the divine commandment. The neglect of
a single and important commandment would already be a reprehensible negligence;
however, the offense is all the more flagrant, since Eve remembers the order of
God and despises it in some way before his eyes. The Psalmist after saying,
"They keep the remembrance of his commandments," so is right to add:
"in order to observe them. Often, in fact, one remembers the commandment
only to brave it, and the sin is all the more serious because one has not
forgiven for excuse.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

tree, your eyes will be open and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.
Could the woman have been persuaded by these words that God had forbidden them
a good and useful thing, if she had not already conceived with her own strength
a secret love and a high idea, which the temptation was to unveil and Moreover,
not content to listen to the snake, she casts her eyes on the tree, "she
sees that the fruit was good to eat and pleasant to see. Imagining that he was
not capable of killing him, and that, doubtless, God had attached only an
allegorical meaning to this threat: "You will die of death, if you eat
it," she took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to her husband, doubtless
adding some engaging words, which the scriptural silence would suggest, unless
the man, seeing that his wife was dead, did not would need more encouragement. <b>[Literal Commentary on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

I will be asked if the snake was endowed with reason. Assuredly not, and the
sense of Scripture is that it was the devil who borrowed his organ, and who
deceived the man by an effect of his black jealousy. The serpent, then, was
only the docile instrument of his malice, and he used it to tempt the woman
first, as being weaker, and then to lead, through her, the first man. So he
pitched his ambushes through the serpent, and through his organ he entered into
conversation with the woman: Why did he ask him, God did he say to you: do not
eat the fruit of all the trees that are in paradise? But, consider the malice
of this artificial spirit. It seems as though he only wishes to insinuate a
good thought, and to question the woman on this defense only by the motive of a
tender interest. This is what this word shows: Why did God tell you: Do not eat
the fruit of the roofs of the trees that are in paradise? This evil spirit
seems to say to him: Why did God forbid you so sweet enjoyment? and why did he
not grant you the use of all the fruits produced by this garden? he has only
allowed you to see it to make your privation more painful and bitter. Why did
God tell you? What! he added, "is it really to your advantage to live in
this garden, since you can not enjoy his productions? Or rather, is it not a
real torture to see these beautiful fruits, and to be unable to eat them?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Observe as words
insinuated the poison in the heart of the woman. From the beginning she must
have suspected the mischief of her interlocutor, for he lied to her knowingly,
and seemed interested only in knowing the command of the Lord, and then urging
him to transgress it. Eve could easily see the imposture; and she must suddenly
repulse the words of the evil spirit and not become the plaything of her
mischief, but she would not do it. It was necessary, I say, that from the
beginning she should break the interview, and henceforth confine herself to
speaking to the man for whom alone she had been formed, and of which she was
the companion and the equal, no less than help and consolation. But she allowed
herself, I do not know how, to engage in this fatal colloquy, and she listened
to the insidious words which the devil addressed to her through the organ of
the serpent. At least it was easy for him to admit that these words were only
deception and lies, since they affirmed the very opposite of what God had
commanded them. That is why at the moment she must have fled, broken all
relations and cursed that evil spirit who dared to censure the Lord's orders.
But Eve was so light and so thoughtless that, far from escaping, she revealed
to the devil the divine precept, and, according to the expression of the
Gospel, she threw precious stones before a hog. Thus she acts against this
commandment of the Savior: Do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they
(89) trample them underfoot, and turning, they do not tear you. (Matt VII, 6.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">This is what happened
then: Eve threw before the devil, that filthy pig and that fierce beast, the
pearls of the divine precept; and this evil spirit, which acted by the organ of
the serpent, trampled them unworthily by its daring lies; then again, turning
against the woman, he made her and the man fall into the abyss of disobedience,
so dangerous is it to reveal the divine secrets indistinctly! Notice to those
who talk of religion indifferently with all! For Jesus Christ, in this place of
the Gospel, designates much less true swine than those men whose manners are
depraved, and who plunge themselves, like real pigs, into the mire of sin. He
teaches us, therefore, to observe the persons and morals of those to whom we
explain the teachings of religion, lest these conversations be mutually
harmful. For, besides that spirits of this character do not profit by our
words, they often drag into the abyss those who, without any discretion, spread
before them these divine pearls. So, let us be cautious and reserved, so as not
to be seduced like our first parents. For if the woman had not thrown the
pearls before this swine, she would not have disobeyed God himself, nor would
he have dragged the man into his sin.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But let's listen to the
woman's answer. The tempter asks: Why did God tell you: Do not eat all the
fruits of the trees of Paradise? and the woman answers, We eat the fruit of all
the trees of this garden; but for the fruit of the tree which is in the midst
of the garden, God said to us, Do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest you die. Do
you see the malice of the devil? he had made a lie to engage in conversation
and learn what the command of the Lord was. And, indeed, the woman, too
confident in her supposed benevolence, discovered to her, with precept, all the
economy of the divine decrees; but it thus removed all means of defense. Eh!
What could you, O woman, answer to such a word: The Lord said: Do not eat all
the fruits of the trees of Paradise? you must suddenly drive out that insolent
man, who dared to speak other than God, and say to him, "Get away, you
deceiver; you do not know the importance of the commandment that is given to
us, and you know neither the goods we enjoy nor the abundance where we are of
all things. You dare to say that God has forbidden us the use of the fruits of
this garden! but, on the contrary, the Creator God has deigned, in His immense
goodness, to allow us to enjoy all things and to eat of all fruits, except for
one whom he has excepted in our interest, lest we die.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">(Gen. 3:4-5) It was thus
that the woman had to repel the tempter, and the slightest prudence advised him
to break up the interview and not to prolong it. But, not content with having
revealed to the devil the precept and divine command, she listened to her
treacherous and dangerous counsels; The woman said, We eat the fruit of the
trees of this garden, but for the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of
the garden, God said to us, Do not eat this fruit and touch it, out of fear
that you do not die; and now the evil spirit is blowing on him a counsel quite
opposite to that of God. It was by a trait of providence towards man, and to
protect him from death, that the Lord had made him this defense; but the devil
said to Eve, You will not die. How to excuse such imprudence? and how could Eve
listen to such a daring language? God said, Do not eat this fruit, lest you
die; and the demon dares to say to him: No, you will not die. Moreover, it is
not enough for him to contradict the divine word, he still accuses the Creator
of acting in a spirit of jealousy, and he leads his deceit with so much skill
that he seduces the woman and realizes her iniquitous projects. No, you will
not die, he says, but God knows that the day you eat this fruit, your eyes will
open and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil. (Gen. III, 5.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

bait and the mortal poison that the demon presents to the woman, and the latter
does not suspect the danger, although, from the beginning, it is very easy for
her to recognize it. But learning that God's defense was because he knew that
their eyes would be open, and that they themselves would be gods, knowing good
and evil, she prides herself on this flattering hope and conceived great
thoughts. (90) Such is still today the artifice of the devil he raises us by
his deceptive suggestions and then lets us fall into a deep abyss. <b>[Homilies on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

not nullify her sin; rather, she repeated it. Certainly it stands to reason
that she did intend to lure the person whom she loved to share in her

the danger of falling into a sin of which she had knowledge. Yet this woman,
knowing that she could not remain in Paradise after the Fall, seems to have had
a fear that she alone would be ejected from the Garden. Hence, after the Fall,
they both went into hiding. Being aware, therefore, that she would have to be

have remained incorruptible if it had been allowed to eat from the tree of life.
But how to admit an immortal body for whom food is a necessary support? An

AND ON WHAT THEIR EYES ARE THEY OPENING? "So they ate it and their eyes
opened," but on what? It was alas! to test the fires of concupiscence and
to suffer the pain of sin which, with death, had been insinuated into their
flesh. This was no longer just that animal body, which could be transformed, if
they had persevered in obedience, into a more perfect and spiritual body
without passing through death; it became a flesh of death and a law now fought
in the members "against the law of the spirit" (Rom. VII, 23). For
they had not been created with eyes closed; they had not groped their way in
Eden, exposed, without knowing it, the forbidden tree and reaped its fruits in
spite of themselves. Besides, how could the animals have been brought to Adam
to see how he would name them, if he had not seen? How could the woman have
been presented to man and would she have said to him: "Here is the bone of
my bones and the flesh of my flesh (Gen. II, 19, 22, 23)," s' he had been
blind? Finally, how could Eve herself have seen that the forbidden fruit

necessary, however, by taking a single word in the metaphorical sense, to
change this passage into an allegory. It is up to us to examine in what sense
the serpent said, "Your eyes will open. No doubt the serpent has held this
language, the sacred writer recounts it; but we can examine what is the meaning
of it. These expressions: "Their eyes were opened and they realized that
they were naked," are the narrative of a historical fact; nothing
authorizes us to see an allegory. The Evangelist apparently did not introduce
in his story the metaphorical words of any character, but recalled in his name
what had happened when he said of the two disciples of Emmaus, one of whom was
called Cleophas, that their eyes were opened, when the Lord broke the bread,
and they knew him; these disciples indeed had not walked with their eyes
closed, but their sight was at first impotent to recognize the Savior (Luke
XXIV, 13-31). In these two stories there is no allegory, although the
Scriptures say figuratively that their eyes were opened. They were not closed
indeed, but they opened in the sense that they fixed on objects that had not
attracted their attention until then. When, therefore, Adam and Eve had been
led to break the precept by a criminal curiosity, eager to recognize the
mysterious consequences they would have to suffer if they touched the forbidden
fruit, and, having seen this fruit very similar to those of which they had
eaten without experiencing any harm, they had more inclination to believe that
God would easily excuse their fault, to resist the temptation to discover the
properties of this fruit, as well as the motive which had decided God to defend
them ; when they had transgressed the commandment and were stripped inwardly of
the grace which they had offended by their pride and the fumes of their vanity;
then they cast their eyes upon their bodies and experienced, by a hitherto
unknown movement, the disorders of concupiscence. Consequently, their eyes
opened on a point which had hitherto escaped their attention, although they had
previously been open to other objects.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

MORTALITY AND CONCUPISCENCE. Death thus entered their organs during the day,
even where the defense of God was violated. Their body no longer had that
marvelous state in which the mysterious virtue of the tree of life maintained
it, which would have protected it from disease as an attack on old age, for
although it was still animal and it was to be transformed only later, the
effect of the tree of life already represented the all-spiritual effect of
wisdom which makes the Angels participate in eternity apart from all decay.
Thus deteriorated, their body contracted the principles of sickness and death
which are equally peculiar to animals, and like them it felt the appetite of
the sexes destined to fill the voids of death. However, the nobility of the
reasonable soul, bursting forth even in its punishment, made it blush with the
brutal movement that was going on in the limbs; shame was born in her, of the
strange sensation she had not yet felt, and especially of the idea that sin was
the cause of this gross inclination. This was the exact application of the word
of the prophet: "Lord, you have in your will given brilliance to my power;
you then turned your face and I was quite disturbed (Ps. XXIX, 8). In this
confusion they had recourse to fig leaves, made themselves belts, and, for
renouncing a glorious state, concealed their shameful nakedness. These leaves
doubtless had in their eyes no relation to the revolted organs which were to be
veiled; they resorted to it only under the secret impulse of shame which
disturbed them, so as to reveal, without their knowledge, their true
punishment. <b>[Literal Commentary on

befitting to look at what is not lawful to be lusted after. For that the mind
may be preserved pure in thought, the eyes must be forced away from the
wantonness of their pleasure, like a kind of ravishing unto sin. For neither
would Eve have touched the forbidden free, except she had looked on it first
without taking heed; since it is written, And the woman saw that the tree was
good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree delightful to
look upon, and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat. [Gen. 3, 6] Hence,
therefore, it is to be estimated with, what great control we who are living a

dreaming of equality with God, hastened to gather the forbidden fruit; her
eyes, her mind and her heart stopped there, fixedly, and she thought only of
exhausting the poisoned cup which the devil had prepared for her. Such were
certainly her dispositions from the moment she listened to the pernicious
counsels of the devil, and Scripture testifies to it. For the woman, she says,
saw that the fruit was good to eat, and beautiful to see, and of a delectable
aspect; and she took some and ate it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

says, bad conversations corrupt good morals. (I Corinthians XV, 33.) Eh! Whence
comes it that before the counsel of the devil the woman had not had such
thoughts, and that she had neither fixed this tree particularly, nor considered
the beauty of her fruit? it was because she respected the defense of the Lord,
and feared the punishment of which he threatened his disobedience. But as soon
as she had listened to this perverse and evil spirit, she believed and had
nothing to fear from eating the forbidden fruit, and that even they would
become equal to God. This hope thus excited her to pluck fruit, and, flattering
herself to rise above humanity, she added more faith to the perfidious
insinuations of the enemy of our salvation than to the words of God. But his
experience soon taught him the fatal consequences of this pernicious advice and
the terrible misfortunes that were about to envelop him. For as soon as she
saw, says the Scripture, that the fruit was good to eat, and beautiful to see,
and of a delectable aspect, she followed the impulse of the evil spirit that
spoke to her through the organ of the serpent, and reasoned thus in itself: If
this fruit seems good to eat, if it charms the eye and if it is of a delectable
aspect, and if it must, moreover, raise us to the supreme honors and make us as
great as the Creator, why should I hesitate to pick him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

how the Devil captivated the woman, and how he troubled her reason? She
ventured to carry her hopes above her condition, and the proud hope of
obtaining imaginary goods made her lose those she really possessed. So she took
that fruit and ate it, and she gave it to her husband, and they ate it, and
their eyes were open, and they knew they were naked. What have you done, O
woman! Yielding to treacherous counsel, you have trampled on the law of the
Lord and despised His commandments! What! by an excess of intemperance, the use
of all these fruits so numerous and varied has not sufficed for you, and you
have dared to pluck the very one of which God had forbidden you to eat! At
last, you have believed the words of the serpent, and you have esteemed his
advice more salutary than the orders of the Creator! Alas! your presumption
renders this crime irreparable. But whoever spoke to you was he your equal? No,
no doubt; it was one of your subjects: he was subject to you and he was your
slave. Why then degrade yourself to the point of abandoning the man for whom
you have been formed and whose help and consolation you have been created? You
share the dignity of his nature and the nobility of his word, and you may have
conversed familiarly with the serpent, which has become the organ of the devil,

friendship of God! What strange madness has inspired you this audacity? Was not
it enough for you to lead a sweet life and to be clothed in a body, without
experiencing its weaknesses? You enjoyed all the fruits of earthly paradise,
with the exception of one, and, queen of the universe, you command all

counsel will laugh at your ills; he will insult your fall and congratulate
himself for having dragged you into his misfortune. For it is because, swollen
with pride, he wanted to rise above his condition, (91) that he was stripped of
his dignity and precipitated from heaven on earth; and in the same way he

and not be made an accomplice to his disobedience. Did such a frivolous
pleasure deserve that he deprived himself of the most excellent advantages, and
that he offended the Master who had enriched him with so many goods, and who
had granted him an existence exempt from pains and fatigues? Was he not allowed
to enjoy abundantly all the fruits of earthly paradise? Why then, O man! Did
you not want to, and you too, observe this slight defense? Because, no doubt,
you have known by your wife the promise of the tempting spirit; and suddenly,

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">So the woman took the
fruit and gave it to her husband, and they ate it; and their eyes were opened,
and they knew they were naked. Here is the important question I was talking
about yesterday; for it is right to ask what virtue this tree had, whose fruit
opened the eyes of those who ate it, and why it is called the tree of the
science of good and evil. Wait a little, please, and I will satisfy your just
curiosity. And first, let us observe that a right and enlightened study of the
Holy Scriptures easily resolves the difficulties. Thus it is not precisely
because Adam and Eve ate this fruit that their eyes were opened, since before
they had the use of sight; but because this act of intemperance was at the same
time an act of disobedience to the Lord's orders, it is attributed to him the
privation of the glory which surrounded them, and of which they themselves had
made themselves unworthy.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">This is why Scripture
says, according to its ordinary language, that they ate it, and that their eyes
were opened, and that they knew that they were naked. Yes, sin, by stripping
them of heavenly grace, gave them the feeling of their nakedness; so that this
shame which seizes them suddenly made them see in what abyss their disobedience
had precipitated them. Before this disobedience, they lived in perfect security
and did not suspect that they were naked; but they were not so, since celestial
glory covered them better than any garment. But when they had eaten forbidden
fruit and thus violated the precept of the Lord, they were reduced to such deep
humiliation that the feeling of shame led them to seek a veil over their
nakedness. It was because the transgression of the divine precept had stripped
them of the glory and celestial grace which clothed them as a splendid garment;
and, by making them know their nakedness, she had penetrated them with a strong
feeling of shame.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And they intertwined fig
leaves and made themselves belts. Measure, my dear brother, I invite you to the
depths of the abyss where, from the height of glory, the demon made our first
parents fall. Formerly they were clothed with a celestial luster, and now they
are forced to intertwine fig leaves and make sashes. Such was the result of the
deceits of the devil and the pitfalls he offered them. Of course, he did not
propose to give them any new advantages, but he only wanted to strip them of
those they possessed, and thus reduce them to a shameful nakedness. And because
their disobedience had the opportunity of the forbidden fruit, Scripture says
that they ate it and that their eyes were opened, which must be understood as
the perception of the mind rather than the organ of view; for, after their sin,
God made them feel impressions which, by an effect of his extreme goodness,
they had previously ignored. This expression their eyes were open means that
God made them feel the shame of their nakedness and the privation of the glory
they enjoyed. Moreover, this language is ordinary in Scripture, as is proved by
this passage in Genesis: Hagar, a fugitive slave, wandered in the wilderness,
and, having placed his child under a palm tree, she went away not to to see
die. So, God opened his eyes. (Genesis XXI, 19.) It is not (92) that she saw
before, but that God enlightened her understanding; so that this word opens
must be understood rather of the mind than of the organ of sight.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">I will give the same
solution to a second difficulty. For some say, why is this tree called the tree
of the science of good and evil? And we even see some who oppose the argument
that Adam had discernment of good and evil only after eating the fruit of this
tree, but it is pure extravagance. Already, and as if to answer in advance, I spoke
at length about science. infused by Adam; now this science was revealed by the
correctness of the names which it imposed on all birds and all animals, and by
the gift of prophecy which was its glorious coronation. It can not be said,
therefore, that he who named all the animals, and who uttered so admirable a
prophecy about the woman, knew nothing of good and evil. Besides, such an
assumption would do, what God forbid! to pour on God even a horrible blasphemy.
For could he have given orders to man if he had invincibly ignored disobedience
as an evil? But it was not so; and Adam knew perfectly well what he was doing,
since from the beginning he possessed free will. In the contrary case, his
disobedience would not have been more worthy of punishment than his submission
of praise. On the contrary, it is evident from the very words of the precept,
and subsequently from events, that the act of their disobedience alone
subjected our first parents to death. This is what the woman herself says to
the serpent: For the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
said: Did not eat it, lest you die. Thus before their sin they were immortal,
otherwise their prevarication could not have been punished by the punishment of
death.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Can we therefore maintain
that it is by eating the forbidden fruit that man acquires the knowledge of
good and evil? But did not he already have this knowledge, he who was full of
wisdom and adorned with the gift of prophecy? and how can it be reasonably
supposed that goats, sheep, and other herbivorous animals can distinguish
between useful plants and weeds, in order to graze some and move away from one
another, and that man, endowed with reason, does not know to discern good from
evil? But it is no less true, you say, that this tree is called in Scripture
the tree of the science of good and evil. I agree with that; and yet it is
enough to be a little familiar with the style of Scripture to realize this
expression. He was so called, not that he gave man the knowledge of good and evil,
but because he was the occasion of his disobedience and he introduced the
knowledge and shame of sin. . And in fact. Scripture often designates facts by
the circumstances that accompany them; and as this tree was to be for man an
occasion of sin or merit, she called it the tree of the science of good and
evil.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The Lord wanted from the
beginning to make known to man that the God who created the universe had also
given him being. He therefore gave him this little commandment so that he might
recognize his title of Master and Lord. Thus a generous proprietor who grants
to his steward the usufruct of a magnificent palace, demands a fee, as a proof
of his right of property. The steward thus knows that this palace does not
belong to him, and that he enjoys it only by the goodness and liberality of his
master. And so was the Creator, who had made man king of nature; and who had
placed him in the terrestrial paradise of which he fully enjoyed, wished to
avoid that, seduced by his own thoughts, he could believe that the universe
existed by itself, and that he did not pride himself on his superiority.
Therefore he forbade him the fruit of a single tree, and threatened him in case
of disobedience; the most severe punishment, to oblige him to recognize a
Master, and to proclaim that he had all his advantages from his pure
liberality. But the presumptuous temerity of Adam precipitated him with Eve
into a frightful ruin; they transgressed the commandment, and ate forbidden
fruit. This is why this tree has been called the tree of the science of good
and evil. It is not that they did not know beforehand the good and the bad, as
the words of the woman to the serpent prove: God said to us: Do not eat this
fruit, lest you die. They knew, therefore, that death would be the punishment
for their disobedience; so it is after having eaten forbidden fruit that they
were stripped of their garment of glory, and that they felt the shame of their
nakedness. This tree is therefore called the tree of the science of good and
evil, because it was destined to test their obedience.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now you understand how
Scripture says that their eyes were opened, and that they knew they were naked.
You also understand why this tree was called the tree of the science of good
and evil. But appreciate, if it is possible, what was their shame, when after
eating the forbidden fruit, and transgressing the precept of the Lord, they
intertwined fig leaves and made themselves belts. See how from the summit of
glory they were precipitated in the deepest humiliation! Those who previously
lived on earth as angels, are reduced to cover themselves with fig leaves, so
sin is a great evil! For it deprives us first of all of God's grace and
friendship, and then covers us with shame and confusion. Moreover, after having
stripped us of the possessions we possessed, he robs us of the hope of
recovering them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But I reproach myself for
ending this conversation with the sad considerations which the intemperance of
man, his disobedience and his fall, furnish me with. That is why, please, on
the occasion of this tree, I will speak of the tree of the cross, and to the
evils that the first has produced, I will oppose the goods that the second has
produced to us. However, it is not properly the tree that caused these
disasters, but the will of the sinful man and his contempt for the divine
precept. I will say, then, that the first tree brought death into the world,
for death followed sin, and the second brought us back to immortality. One
chased us out of paradise, and the other opened the entrance to heaven. He has
weighed on Adam, for one fault, the hard burden of human misery, and this one
has delivered us from the weight of our sins, and has given us a sweet and full
confidence in the Lord. <b>[Homilies on

everywhere? In my opinion God may be said to walk wherever throughout Scripture
the presence of God is implied, when we hear that He sees all things and ‘the
eyes of the Lord are upon the just.’ (Ps. 33:16) We read, too, that Jesus knew
their thoughts and we read: ‘Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts?’
(Lk. 6:8: Matt. 9:4) When we reflect, therefore, on these statements, we have a
knowledge of God in the act of walking. The sinner, in fact, had tried to hide
away from the sight of God. He wished to conceal himself in his thoughts and
was unwilling that his works appear in the light of day.’ (Matt. 5:16) <b>[On Paradise 68]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"<i>And they heard the voice of the
Lord walking in the garden in the evening.</i>" It was indeed the time
when they should be visited, they who had gone away from the light of truth. It
is possible that God spoke to them beforehand by addressing their intelligence
with, or without language, as He is still speaking to the Angels, enlightening
their minds with its immutable light and making them understand at one and the
same moment what develops in the following times. God, I say, could maintain
them in the same way, without, however, communicating wisdom to them as fully
as to the Angels. Whatever distance he placed between them and man, according
to the scope of his intelligence, he did not fail to visit them and speak to
them; and perhaps he employed physical means, such as the images which delight
the spirit in ecstasy; appearances that strike the eyes or the ears, like those
where God is under. the cover of an angel or sound his word in a cloud. As for
the sound they heard, at the moment when God was walking towards evening, he
was formed by the organ of a creature: it would be a mistake to believe that
the invisible and immense essence of the Trinity was shown to them in a sensible
way, in a certain place and at a certain moment.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

coming in the garden after the middle of the day; and Adam and his wife hid

brothers, we must neither pass lightly on these words, nor stop as at the bark
of words; but we must consider with what condescension Scripture is
proportioned to our weakness, and give to these words a meaning worthy of God
and of our salvation. And indeed, these words taken literally would be unworthy
of God, and would they not offer, I ask you, an absurd meaning? For what do we
read in this passage of Genesis? They heard the voice of the Lord, who went
into the garden after the middle of the day, and they hid themselves. What do
you say, O Moses? does God walk? will we believe that he has feet, and will we
have no more sublime idea of ​​him? but how would the One who fills the
universe of his presence walk? and how He, whose heaven is the throne and the
earth, would the footstool be shut up in the garden? It would be foolish to say
it. What do these words mean: They heard the voice of the Lord, who was coming
into the garden about the middle of the day? They teach us that the Lord wanted
to make them feel their fault by bringing them to extreme anguish of mind and
heart. This is what happened; for they were so ashamed that at the approach of
God they hid themselves. As a result of their sin and disobedience, they had
experienced remorse and confusion.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And indeed, this
incorruptible judge, whom we call consciousness, rises up against man and
accuses him aloud; he puts his sins before his eyes, and represents to him all
the clumsiness. That is why God, in creating man, establishes within himself
that censor that never stops and that can not be deceived. No doubt, one can
steal one's faults and crimes from the knowledge of men, but it is impossible
to hide them from consciousness; and in whatever place the guilty man
transports himself, he carries within himself that consciousness which accuses
him, disturbs him, tears him up, and never rests. She attacks him in the
intimacy of the domestic hearth, on the forum and in the public meetings, and
pursues him during feasts, during his sleep and when he wakes up. She never
ceases to ask him to account for her faults, and to bring to her before her
eyes the graver and the punishment. Such, a charitable physician, assiduously
accompanies a patient, and, in spite of his rejections, persists in offering
him his remedies and his good offices.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Besides, the main duty of
the conscience is to remind us of our faults and to protest against their
culpable forgetfulness; she presents us with the picture, if only to restrain
us and prevent us from falling back into it. And yet, in spite of the support
and the help of the conscience, and in spite of its violent reproaches and the
remorse which rends our killer, and which are for our soul as cruel
executioners, most men can not overcome their passions; also in what abyss would
we fall, if it did not exist? It was therefore the reproaches of conscience
that revealed to our first parents the approach of the Lord; and suddenly they
hid themselves. Why did they do it? I’m asking you. Because the conscience,
like a harsh accuser, reproached them for their crime. And indeed, they had no
other censor, nor any other witness of their sin than that which they carried
within themselves; yet to the reproaches of conscience was added the privation
of the glory which clothed them. Thus, the feeling of their nakedness warned
them of the fault of their fault, and because they were ashamed of their grave
disobedience, they tried to hide themselves. They heard, says the Scripture,
the voice of the Lord God, who was coming into the garden after the middle of
the day; and Adam and his wife hid among the trees of paradise to avoid the
presence of God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Nothing, then, is more
sinister than sin, my dearest brethren, for as soon as man commits it, he fills
him with confusion, and renders foolish those who shone before by the solidity
of judgment. Hey! see Adam! it is the conduct of a fool; and yet he was endowed
with the gift of prophecy and that high wisdom which had broken out in his
works. But he hears the voice of the Lord advancing in the garden, and hides,
like his wife, among the trees of paradise, to avoid the presence of God. Is
not this a real trait of madness? What! God is present everywhere, he has drawn
all creatures from nothing, and none is hidden from his eyes; he has formed the
heart of man, and he knows all the secret affections of it; he scrutinizes the
loins and the hearts, and he penetrates to the most intimate thoughts of the
soul. And this is the one in whose eyes Adam and Eve are trying to hide. But do
not be surprised, my dear brother, such is the sinner's method. He knows (96)
that he can not avoid the presence of God, and yet he tries to avoid it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The conduct of our first
parents also had as its principle the shame which seized them, when sin had
stripped them of their glorious immortality. This is proven by the very choice
of their retreat, since they hid among the trees of earthly paradise. The rogue
or lazy servants seek, under the impression of fear and chastisement, to hide
themselves in every corner of the house, although they know well that they will
not avoid the eye of an irritated master. And likewise Adam and Eve, not
knowing where to take refuge, ran here and there in the terrestrial paradise.
Nor is it without reason that Scripture designates the hour: They heard, she
said, the voice of the Lord God who was coming into the garden after the middle
of the day. She wants to make us know the extreme goodness of the Lord. He did
not differ, therefore, for a moment in helping the sinful man, and as soon as
he saw him fall, he hastened to run. at the first glance he sounded the depth
of his wound, and to prevent its consequences and progress, he hastened to
bring a beneficent device to it. Thus his goodness did not allow him to leave,
even for a moment, the man deprived of all help.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The enemy of our
salvation had given free rein to his rage; and because he envied the man the
property he possessed, he had given him snares to make him fall from this happy
state. But the Lord, whose providence and wisdom regulate our destinies, has
seen both the malignancy of the devil and the weakness of man, it is this
weakness which made him yield to the insinuations of his wife and fall into the
shameful abyss. of sin. So the Lord suddenly appears, and, like a good and
indulgent judge, he sits down on his tribunal, surrounded by fear and horror,
and hears the affair with the greatest attention. He thus teaches us not to
condemn our brothers without having thoroughly examined their conduct.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to this solemn questioning of the Judge's requests and the answers of the
guilty, the sentence that strikes them, and the condemnation of the tempter who
handed them these treacherous snares. But bring all your attention here, and
shudder while attending to this judgment. When a mortal judge places himself on
his court, quotes the culprits and subjects them to torture, a thrill of terror
seizes the spectators. All want to hear the judge's requests and the
defendants' answers. What will be our thoughts when, in our presence, God, creator
of the universe, will come to trial with his creatures! And yet you will
observe how, even here, divine clemency prevails over the severity of the
judges of the earth. <b>[Homilies on

transmit it to the woman, it is the man who is interrogated first. The
commandment is communicated from the Lord to the woman through the medium of
man; sin passes from the devil to man through the woman. All these facts are

Paradise, and I was afraid because I was naked and hid. It is very likely that
God usually showed himself to these first humans under the cover of a creature
having the human form and disposed for this purpose; and as he kept his mind
turned towards supernatural things, he had never allowed them to perceive their
nakedness, before the moment when sin made them feel by a just punishment a
shameful movement in their limbs. So they felt the impression of a man in the
presence of another man, and this impression, punishment of their fault, led
them to try to hide from the one to whom nothing can be hidden, and to steal
their bodies from the sight of Him who reads in hearts. But is it any wonder
that, having wished in their pride to become like gods, they have fainted in
their own thoughts and have seen their foolish heart covered with darkness? In
their prosperity they are. are given the name of sages, and the Lord having
turned away his face, they became stupid men (Romans II, 21, 22) .But the
subject of their shame, the motive that had made them take belts, became more
still frightful, when it was necessary to appear in this accoutrement before
Him who familiarly lowered himself to visit them and borrowed, so to speak, the
eyes of a human creature. And if he appeared to them in the same form as he
showed himself to Abraham, at the foot of the oak of Mamre (Gen. xviii. 1), in
order to speak to them as a man to a man, they last after their sin to find a a
new subject of shame in that tenderness close to friendship which, before sin,
inspired them with so much confidence. So they dared not show these divine eyes

him, and thus to give him the opportunity to implore his forgiveness, attests
an infinite mercy. Adam, where are you? Oh! that this question alone is at once

clothed in glory, and I find you in shameful nakedness. Adam, where are you?
what is the cause of your misfortune? and who has plunged you into this abyss

sin which he had at that moment committed. For the question ought not to be
read in a merely interrogative tone, Where are you, Adam? but with an
impressive and earnest voice, and with an air of imputation, Oh, Adam, where
are you?—as much as to intimate: you are no longer here, you are in
perdition—so that the voice is the utterance of One who is at once rebuking and
sorrowing. God put the question with an appearance of uncertainty, in order
that even here He might prove man to be the subject of a free will in the
alternative of either a denial or a confession, and give to him the opportunity
of freely acknowledging his transgression, and, so far, of lightening it. In
like manner He inquires of Cain where his brother was, just as if He had not
yet heard the blood of Abel crying from the ground, in order that he too might
have the opportunity from the same power of the will of spontaneously denying,
and to this degree aggravating, his crime; and that thus there might be
supplied to us examples of confessing sins rather than of denying them: so that
even then was initiated the evangelic doctrine, "By your words you shall
be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned." Matthew 12:37
Now, although Adam was by reason of his condition under law subject to death,
yet was hope preserved to him by the Lord's saying, "Behold, Adam is
become as one of us;" that is, in consequence of the future taking of the
man into the divine nature. Then what follows? "And now, lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of life, (and eat), and live for
ever." Inserting thus the particle of present time, "And now,"
He shows that He had made for a time, and at present, a prolongation of man's
life. Therefore He did not actually curse Adam and Eve, for they were
candidates for restoration, and they had been relieved by confession. <b>[Against Marcion 2.25]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

call to that divine mercy which always surpasses in kindness and indulgence the
malice of our sins. And indeed, the Lord came, by his ineffable patience, to
touch the heart of Adam and make him feel the scorn of his fault; and now he
seeks to apologize, saying, "The woman you gave me as a companion brought
me fruit from that tree and I ate it. It is as if he had said: I have sinned, I
know it, but the woman whom you gave me for a companion, and of whom you have
said yourself: give to the man an aid which is like, was the cause of my fall.
Could I suspect that this woman whom you had given me for a companion would be

(Gen 3:13) That fault is pardonable which is followed by an admission of guilt.
The woman, therefore, is not to be despaired of, who did not keep silent before
God, but who preferred to admit her sin-.the woman on whom was passed a
sentence that was salutary. It is good to suffer condemnation for our sins and
to be scourged for our crimes, provided we are scourged along with other men.
Hence, Cain, because he wanted to deny his guilt, was judged unworthy to be
punished in his sin. He was forgiven without prescribed penalty, not, perhaps,
for having committed such a serious crime as parricide-he was responsible for
his brother's death-as one of sacrilege, in that he thought he had deceived God
when he said: ' I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?' [ Gen 4:9 ] And so
the accusation is reserved for his accuser, the Devil, prescribing that he be
scourged along with his angels, since he did not wish to be scourged with men.
Of such, therefore, has it been said: ' There is no regard for their death and
they shall not be scourged like other men.' [ Ps 72:4,5 ] The woman's case is,
accordingly, of a different character. Although she incurred the sin of
disobedience, she still possessed in the tree of Paradise food for virtue. And
so she admitted her sin and was considered worthy of pardon. ' The just is
first accuser of<span>  </span>himself in the
beginning of his speech.' [ Prov 18:17 ] No one can be justified from sin
unless he has first made confession of his sin. Wherefore the Lord says: ' Tell

back to pardon, was not asked concerning the sin. Thus man was asked the
question ‘where he was,’ that he might review the offence committed, and by
confessing it take knowledge how far he had departed from the face of his
Creator. But both preferred to take to themselves the cordials of defense
rather than of confession. And while the man was minded to alleviate the sin
through the woman, and the woman through the serpent, they added to the sin,
which they endeavored to vindicate; Adam by indirectly glancing at the Lord,
how that he had Himself proved the author of their sin, in that He had made the

on these words, my dearest brothers; for a careful examination will show us
useful instructions. The judgments of the Lord are terrible and frightening;
but if we meditate carefully, they will be beneficial to our souls. Let us
listen to Adam, who says to God: The woman you gave me as a companion
introduced me to the fruit, and I ate it. Thus he acknowledges that there has
been no compulsion or violence against him, and that he has acted voluntarily
and with complete freedom. Eve only presented the fruit to her, and she
exercised no pressure or violence on him. And in the same way she does not say,
to excuse herself, that the snake has been inclined to eat the forbidden fruit
in spite of herself. It limits itself to saying: the snake deceived me. Now it
depended on her to reject seduction as to succumb to it: the snake deceived me,
she said. It is therefore true that the enemy of our salvation, speaking by the
organ of this accursed animal, gave a fatal advice, and deceived the woman. But
he did not violate it, nor compel it: he used only fraud to accomplish his
pernicious designs, and if he preferred the woman, it was because he thought
she was more likely to be seduced. and to commit an irreparable fault.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

admission, and he does not press Adam or Eve for new questions. And certainly,
when he questioned them, it was not that he did not know their crime: he knew
him and knew all the circumstances; He did not lower himself to enter into
discussion with them, than in order to make his mercy better manifest, and to
engage them to a humble and sincere confession; therefore he does not ask them
new questions. No doubt it was fitting that God should make known to us the
kind of seduction which had been presented to our first parents; but to show
that he did not question them by ignorance of the fact, he is satisfied with a
first answer. And indeed, in saying that the serpent had deceived her, and that
she had eaten forbidden fruit, the woman easily allowed to guess the fatal hope
of which the demon had flattered her by the organ of the serpent, promising her
that they would become gods. <b>[Homilies

Apostle leans his head, not on the ground, but on Christ’s breast. (Jn. 13:25;

cruel of animals whose breast is between its legs, if men, too, who, ‘minding
the things of the earth’ (Phil. 3:20) and without the inner urge to rise
towards heaven, have the appearance of crawling on their bellies, then we

You will walk on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life</i>.
I will put enmity between you and the woman, between her seed and yours. She
will spine you to the head and you will try to bite at the heel. This judgment
must be heard figuratively; it has been pronounced, but this is all that the
historian's sincerity and the infallible truth of his story obliges us to
believe. The words: "The Lord God says to the serpent," belong to the
narrator, it must be taken literally, in other words, the judgment was actually
pronounced against the serpent. As for the very words of God, the reader has
every liberty to consider whether to hear them literally or figuratively,
according to the principle we have laid down at the beginning of this book.
Thus, therefore, the serpent was not subjected to interrogation; perhaps he had
not acted freely according to his instincts; he had only been the blind
instrument of the devil who was already destined for everlasting fire,
following the sin which impiety and pride had made him commit. But all that is
addressed to the serpent and consequently to the one who has made it an
instrument, can only be taken figuratively: it is the very portrait of the
tempter, as it was to be shown one day to the human race, whose origin goes
back to the very time when this judgment was pronounced against the demon under
the figure of the serpent. What meaning should be attached to these prophetic
words? it is a question which I have endeavored to solve in the two books on
Genesis, published against the Manicheans, and if I find elsewhere the occasion
of deepening it, God will lend me his help to develop it further; but right now
I have to continue my plan without being distracted. <b>[Literal Commentary on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

deceived me, and I ate forbidden fruit; and yet the Lord did not deign to
interrogate this animal, nor to give it cause to defend itself. He did not ask
him any questions, as he had done to the man and to the woman; but as soon as
these presented their justification, he vented all his anger on the serpent, as
on the author of the sin. For the Lord, in whose eyes nothing is hidden, was
not unaware that the serpent had been the instrument of the trap where the
black jealousy of the devil had brought down our first parents. See how he uses
mercy and kindness towards them. He knew everything, yet he said to Adam, Where
are you? and who taught you that you were naked? He also tells Eve: Why did you
do that? But he holds a very different language to the serpent: <i>And the Lord God said to the serpent,
Because you did this</i>. Do you see the difference? God said to the woman, Why
did you do that? And, to the snake: Because you did that. Yes, because you have
lent yourself to this crime, and you have insinuated this perfidious advice;
because you have favored the jealousy of the devil, and you have seconded his
malice against my creature, <i>you are
cursed among all the animals and all the beasts of the earth; you will crawl on
your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life</i>.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Notice, I pray you, the
order and arrangement of this passage, and you will find in it a precious
witness of the goodness of God. The Lord first asked Adam, and then Eve; and
when the latter had appointed his seducer, he disdained to listen to his
defense, and fulminated against him a punishment which will last as long as his
life. Henceforth, therefore, the sight alone of the serpent will remind men
that they must repulse his perfidious counsels and avoid his misleading
pitfalls. But perhaps you will ask why the serpent is punished, while it was
only the instrument of the demon who alone caused all this disaster? Here again
the ineffable goodness of the Lord breaks out. For just as a good father, not
content with pursuing the murderer of his son, breaks and shatters the sword or
dagger that was used for the crime, the Lord punishes the serpent that was the
instrument of the malice of the devil, and wants the sight of this punishment
(100) to proclaim the severity with which he treated the of my own. For if the
instrument was punished so rigorously, what torture was not inflicted on him
who put it into action!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Moreover, Jesus Christ
reveals something to us in his Gospel, when he tells us that in the day of
judgment he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed; go
to the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. (Matt XXV, 41.) It
is therefore for the devil that this fire has been prepared, which will never
be extinguished; and what a more frightful destiny than that of those
unfortunates who neglect their salvation, and thus expose themselves to share
the tortures reserved for the devil and his angels! If, on the contrary, we
wish to embrace virtue and observe the laws of Jesus Christ, we will secure
this kingdom, of which he says: Come, my Father's beloved, possess the kingdom
prepared for you from the beginning of the world. . On one side are the eternal
fires of hell, and on the other, if we are pious and fervent, the kingdom of
heaven. May these thoughts encourage us to work for the salvation of our soul,
to flee sin, and to avoid the pitfalls of the devil!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But if you are not too
tired, I will speak again of the punishment inflicted on the serpent, in order
to show you more and more how the divine mercy is exercised towards us.
Besides, every day, a numerous competition surrounds the court of a judge who
investigates the cause of some criminals; we spend whole days there, and we do
not retire before the meeting is adjourned. For all the more reason, it is
fitting for us to wait with holy readiness for the statement of the judgment
which the Lord will pronounce against the serpent. He will inflict terrible
punishment on him, because he has been the instrument of crime; and the sight
of this sorrow will make us understand what eternal tortures the same God
reserves for the devil. We will also see with what mercy he chastises Adam and
Eve, to whom he addresses a severe remonstrance rather than inflicts a severe
punishment; and we will conclude that we can not sufficiently admire the
goodness of God nor praise his indulgent providence for us. Let us listen to
the sacred writer: And the Lord God said to the serpent Because you have that,
you are cursed among all the animals and all the beasts of the earth; you will
crawl on your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life. I will
put enmity between you and the woman, between your offspring and hers: she will
break your head, and you will insidiously wound her in the heel.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">There is anger and indignation
in these words, but the sin in which the devil, through the serpent's organ,
carried our first parents, is great and enormous. Now the Lord God said to the
serpent, Because you did this; because you have been the minister of the demon
in his homicidal projects, and you have seconded his malice by serving as an
organ to his bad counsels and poisoned flatteries; because you did that, and
you helped to disinherit my creatures from my graces and benevolence, by
lending you to the perfidious designs of the rebellious angel who, in
punishment for his pride and his black jealousy, was precipitated from heaven
on earth; because in all these horrible machinations you have shown yourself
his docile instrument, I inflict on you a punishment that will last forever. So
it will be enough for the devil to see you, so that he knows what tortures are
reserved to him, and to the men, so that they learn to avoid his traps and to
guarantee himself of his pitfalls, if they do not want one day to share his
torments. Thus you are cursed among all animals, because you have made a
treacherous use of the delicacy which distinguishes you from all of them, and
you have used this gift only to cause the greatest evils.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let us not forget this
word of Scripture: The serpent was the most cunning of all the animals that
were on the earth. Therefore the Lord said to him, 'You shall be cursed among
all the animals and all the beasts of the earth. But as this curse had escaped
our senses and our eyes, God wished to inflict upon him a visible punishment
which constantly reminded us of his crime and his punishment. So he adds: You
will crawl on your stomach, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
You have abused your natural qualities, and you have dared to enter into
conversation with the reasonable man I had created: you have thus imitated the
demon, to which you have served as a compliant minister, and who has been
expelled from heaven, because he affected thoughts above his condition. And in
the same way I inflict upon you a punishment that will change your nature. You
will crawl on the earth, and you will feed (101) dust. So, you will never be
able to rise to the sky, rush you will always remain in this state of
humiliation, and only of all the animals, you will feed you of the dust. More:
I will put enmity between you and the woman; between your posterity and his.
For little pleased to see you crawling on the earth, I will make woman your
irreconcilable enemy, so that war will always subsist between your posterity
and his. At last she will crush your head, and you will insidiously wound her
in the heel. Yes, I will give him the strength to walk on your head, and you
will shake in vain under his feet.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to crawl under our feet, and he gives us the power to walk on his head. Is not
this what these words of Jesus Christ mean: Flee with snakes and scorpions? And

The woman's seed is all mankind; the serpent's seed is the source of original

do you ever “watch his head,” i.e. the first rise of thoughts, by bringing them

after a virtuous existence, as I have often said; we can therefore hear this
punishment to the letter. However, it remains to be seen how one can literally
explain these words: "You will be turned towards your husband and he will
rule over you. Indeed, it is natural to believe that a woman, even before sin,
was made to be submissive to man and to be turned to him by virtue of his
subordination. But it may well be admitted that this is a question of condition
rather than attachment, so that slavery, which later put one man to the service
of another, would be a punishment of sin. The Apostle no doubt says,
"Subject one to another by charity" (Gal.5: 43); But he would never
have said, "Dominate one another. The spouses may therefore submit to one
another by charity; but the Apostle does not allow the woman to dominate (I Tim
II, 12). It is a right which the judgment of the Lord has consecrated for man;
the woman has been condemned by her fault rather than by nature to find a
master in her husband; however, she must remain submissive, on pain of further
deterioration and increase her fault. <b>[Literal

For the woman taught the man once, and made him guilty of disobedience, and
wrought our ruin. Therefore because she made a bad use of her power over the
man, or rather her equality with him, God made her subject to her husband.
“Your desire shall be to your husband?” This had not been said to her before.
But how was Adam not deceived? If he was not deceived, he did not then
transgress? Attend carefully. The woman said, “The serpent beguiled me.” But
the man did not say, The woman deceived me, but, “she gave me of the tree, and
I did eat.” Now it is not the same thing to be deceived by a fellow-creature,
one of the same kind, as by an inferior and subordinate animal. This is truly
to be deceived. Compared therefore with the woman, he is spoken of as “not
deceived.” For she was beguiled by an inferior and subject, he by an equal.

of the woman, and that she “did eat, and gave it to her husband”:<span>  </span>so that he transgressed, not captivated by

the days of your life</i>.' (Gen 3:17) The two sentences seem to have a certain
similarity, yet in that similarity there is a great difference. There is a
difference in the way a person eats of the earth, as the serpent is related to
have done and the manner in which this is recorded of the man: 'In sadness
shall you eat.' That very phrase 'in sadness' makes the precise difference.
Note how important this difference is. It is for my benefit that I should eat
the earth in sadness rather than with delight, that is to say, that I should
appear to feel a certain sadness in my bodily acts and senses rather than
experience pleasure in sin. Many, in fact, because of their manifold iniquities
have no awareness of sin. But he who says: ' I chastise my body and bring it
into subjection,' [ 1 Cor 9:27 ] feels sadness because of regret for the sins
to which we are subject. He himself did not have such serious faults for which
he ought to feel sorrow. Hence he teaches us that that kind of sorrow is of
value which has, not this world, but God, as its end. It is right, he says,
that you become sorrowful, so as to feel repentance in the face of God: ' For
the sorrow that is according to God produces salvation, whereas the sorrow that
is according to the world produces death.' [ 2 Cor 7:9,10 ] Take note of those
who in the Old Testament were sorrowful in the midst of their bodily labors and
who attained grace, while those who found delight in such pleasures continued
to be punished. Hence the Hebrews, who groaned in the works of Egypt, [ Exod
2:23 ] attained the grace of the just and those ' who ate bread with mourning
and fear,' (Tob 2:5) were supplied with spiritual good. The Egyptians, on the
other hand, who, in their service to a detestable king, carried out such works
with joy, received no favor. (Exod 16:14-18) <b>[On Paradise]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

traits of kindness and providence towards us: but to appreciate them properly,
it is necessary to deepen each word. And God said to Adam, You have heard the
voice of your wife, and have eaten the only fruit of which I commanded you not
to eat; so, listening to his voice and eating this fruit, you preferred his
insinuations to my command, and you did not want to abstain from the only fruit
of which I had ordered not to eat, for my defense was but you have not

women! that they do not suffer from similar insinuations, and that they do not
allow themselves to do so! For if Adam could not justify himself by rejecting
his sin against woman, it would be of little use to a husband to say: I have
committed this fault out of complaisance for my wife. The woman was placed
under the power of man, and the master was made to obey him. Feet should not
control the head. And yet we too often see that whoever by his rank should be the
head, lowers himself to become the feet, and that which should be the feet,
attributes to himself the functions of the head. It is this confusion which the
great Apostle, the Doctor of the nations, foresaw when he exclaimed:
"Woman, do you know if you will save your husband? and you, husband, do
you know if you will save your wife? (1 Corinthians 7:15.) However, it is up to
man to reject all bad counsel that the woman would allow herself to give him;
and this one must never forget the punishment of which Eve was punished for
having suggested to Adam this fatal disobedience. She must still, far from
imitating Eve, and reproduce her criminal insinuations, learn her misery, and
never give her husband any advice which would not be salutary and useful to
both. But back to our subject.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

commandment, and neither the fear nor the threats of the chastisements that
followed your sin could hold you back, and because you made the enormous
mistake of touching the only fruit that I had excepted, by abandoning you the
use of all the others, the earth is cursed in your work. Here we recognize the
divine goodness in the different way in which he punishes the serpent, an
unreasonable animal, and man, to be endowed with reason. He said to the first,
You are cursed on the earth; and the second: the earth is cursed in your work.

earth is cursed in your work; and to teach us the effects of this curse, he
adds: and you will only eat fruit, during all the days of your life, with a
great work. Do you not see this chastisement go through all ages, and after
having been useful to the first man, still learn from his descendants what is the
origin of their misfortunes? But let us listen to the following words which
better specify the kind of this curse, and the cause of this painful work. And
God says, the earth will produce you thorns and thistles only. These will be
like the monuments of my curse; and you will not make the earth fruitful except
through care and toil. So all your life will flow in sadness and work, so that
they will be a brake that represses the arrogance of your pride, and brings you
back to the thought of your nothingness; you will no longer be tempted to rock
yourself with guilty illusions, for you will feed on the grass of the earth,
and you will eat bread from the sweat of your brow.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

these words, let us observe how the sin of man has changed for him all the
first conditions of life. For it is as if God were saying to him: I had
prepared for you, creating you, a life free from pain, work, fatigue and worry.
You would have enjoyed perfect happiness, and without knowing any of the sad
subjugations of the body, you would have fully tasted all the delights of life.
But you did not know how to appreciate this happy state, and here I curse the
earth. From now on, if you do not sow it and if you do not cultivate it, it
will not give you, as before, its various productions; I will even join these
labors, and these painful labors, with diseases and continual fatigues, so that
you will not succeed in anything except at the price of your sweats, and so

return to dust. Yes, that will be your destiny, until the end of your days, and
until you return to the earth from which you were fired. For it is from the mud
of the earth that the body that I gave you in my goodness was formed, and it is
in this same mud that it will be solved. You are dust, and you will return to
dust. In vain to make you avoid all these evils, I said: Do not eat this fruit,
and the day you eat it, you will certainly die; I did not want your death, and
I did not neglect anything I could do. (104) But you have thrown yourself into

will solve in a few words, and that will end this interview. God says to our
first parents: The day you eat forbidden fruit, you will certainly die. But it
is unmistakable that after their sin and their disobedience, they lived a great
many years. This difficulty is only one for those who read the scripture
superficially; for an attentive reader explains it easily, and easily discovers
the meaning of this passage. Doubtless Adam and Eve lived many years, and yet
the day they heard this saying: You are earth, and you will return to the
earth, a sentence of death was pronounced to them, so that it can be said that
from that moment they died. Thus the meaning of this passage: The day when you
will eat fruit, forbidden, you will certainly die, is that from that moment
they know that they were subject to death. Hey! do not we see that in the courts
the convicted murderer is sent back to prison, and that he stays there long
enough? However, it is already regarded as dead, because a capital punishment
has been rendered against him. And since the day when the Lord pronounced a
death sentence against our first parents, they were subject to this judgment,
although the execution was postponed for many years. <b>[Homilies on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

passage just read. <i>And Adam gave his wife
the name of Eve, which means life, because she is the mother of all living</i>.
Observe here the care taken by the sacred writer to transmit these details to
us. Thus we learn that Adam gave a name to his wife, and that he called her
Eve, that is life, because she is the mother of all living. It is indeed the
stem of the human race and the root and principle of all generations. But after
telling us how Adam gave a name to his wife, Moses again tells us of the
goodness of God, who did not abandon his creatures in the shameful nakedness in
which they had fallen. And the Lord God, he said, gave Adam and his wife coats
of skin, and clothed them. The Lord then acts as a good father behaves to a
prodigal son. This son of a family was endowed with a good naturalness and had
been brought up with care. He enjoyed in the paternal house a rich abundance,
wore silk clothes, and had at his disposal an opulent heritage. But now the
very excess of prosperity hurls him into evil; and then his father cuts off all
these various advantages, keeps him more closely under his control, and
replaces his sumptuous clothes with a simple and common habit which hides only
his nakedness. So Adam and Eve went unworthy of that glorious glory that
covered them and freed them from all the needs of the body. God took away from
them this brilliance and the possession of all the goods they enjoyed before
that time. dreadful fall. However, he had compassion on so great a misfortune,
and seeing them ashamed of a nakedness which they could neither cover nor hide,
he made tunics of skin and clothed them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">So where are the
artifices of the devil? As soon as we listen to his suggestions, he seduces us
with the love of some passing pleasure, and draws us into the abyss of sin.
Then he abandons us, all covered with shame and confusion, to the pity and the
eyes of all. But the Lord, who is always interested in the salvation of our
souls, did not turn away his eyes from the sad state in which our first parents
were reduced, and he gave them a garment whose simplicity alone was a memory of
their fall. And the Lord God made Adam and his wife with tunics of skin, and
clothed them. Observe here, I ask you, with what condescension the Scripture is
proportioned to our weakness. But, I said it, and I repeat it, one must always
give it a sense worthy of God. Thus this word: God made tunics, must be taken
in this sense that he commanded that these tunics existed; and he wanted our
first parents to cover them, so that this garment would constantly remind them
of their disobedience.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Listen, O rich ones! O
you who pride yourself on the work of silkworms, and who adorn you with the
most beautiful fabrics! listen to this lesson of modesty that the Lord gave us
from the first days of creation. Man had deserved death by his sin, and he
needed a garment to hide his nakedness; and now God only puts on him a tunic of
skin. He wanted to teach us to flee a soft and voluptuous life, and to embrace
preferably a hard and austere life. But perhaps the rich, repelled by this
severe morality, will tell me what! do you want us to dress with animal skins?
I do not say that; and our first parents themselves have not always worn this
kind of clothing, for divine goodness never ceases to be generous and
beneficent. Thus, from the day Adam and Eve were subjected to the needs of
nature, and lost the sweet and angelic existence in which they were created,
the Lord allowed them to weave the wool to make clothing. It was proper,
indeed, that man, being reasonable, should be clothed, and that he should not
live like an animal in shame and nakedness. Our clothes thus remind us of the
possessions we have lost, and the chastisement which, by their disobedience,
Adam and Eve, have attracted to all mankind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this frenzied luxury which rejects the use of wool, to wear nothing but silk,
and which even drives extravagance to embellish it with gold embroidery. It is
mainly women who indulge in these vanities; and I say to them: why do you parry
your body? and why do you (107) pride yourself on this pompous paraphernalia?
So you forget that the clothes are a continuation of the punishment inflicted
on our first parents. So the Apostle tells us: Having enough to feed ourselves
and cover ourselves with, we must be happy. (I Tim.6, 8.) Thus we must limit
our solicitude to the bare necessities; and it is enough for our body to be
covered without worrying about the beauty or variety of the clothes. <b>[Homilies on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WHY DID THE LORD GOD SAY ABOUT MAN AFTER THE SIN, "BEHOLD, ADAM IS BECOME
AS ONE OF US"? — Answer. He said "of us" in the plural because
of the holy Trinity, just as he said in man's creation, "Let us make man
to our image" (Gen. 1:26). Here he used the words of one deterring, to
inspire fear in others so that they should not sin; or he used the meaning of
one upbraiding, because not only had man not become what he wanted to become,
but he had even failed to retain what he was when he was made. [Question 81]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

God spoke these words, whatever means he employed; from then on we must see in
the plural an allusion to the Trinity, analogous to that found in this passage:
"Let us do man," or in this other: "We will come to him and live
in him. As the Lord says of himself and his Father (Jn. 14:23). Thus the
promise of the serpent has fallen on the head of the proud; that is where his
aspirations end. "You will be like gods," said the serpent. Here Adam
has become like one of us, "answers God. These divine words are less an
insult, than a terrible warning intended to repress the pride of all men, in
whose interest this story has been composed. Can we see-in fact, in these
words: "He has become like one of us, knowing good and evil," another
goal than to inspire a salutary terror, since, far from becoming what he had

(Gen. III, 22, 23.) Here again the Lord uses expressions proportioned to our
weakness: And the Lord God says: Behold Adam become like one of us, knowing
good and evil. What simplicity of language! but let us understand it in a sense
worthy of God. He reminds us, therefore, of how the devil, by the organ of the
serpent, deceived our first parents. He said to them, "If you eat this
fruit, you will be like gods; and they ate it in the foolish hope of being
equal to divinity. This is why God, wishing to make them feel again the blemish

devil had said to Eve, by the serpent's organ, "Your eyes will be opened,
and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil. So the Lord added, "And
now let us fear that he should lift up his hand, and take from the tree of life,
and eat and live forever. Here again the divine mercy manifests itself; but we
must deepen each of these words to lose nothing, and discover all the hidden
riches. When God made a command to Adam, he allowed him the use of all the
fruits, except for one, threatening him with death, if he dared to touch it.
But in commanding and threatening him, he says nothing about the tree of life.
Adam, created immortal, could, in my opinion, and as far as I understand this
passage, eat the fruit of this tree, as of all the others; and so he could have

why this tree is called the tree of life, I would say that human reason is
incapable of understanding all the works of God. We only know that it pleased
the Lord that in the earthly paradise man had as a matter of the virtue of
obedience and the sin of disobedience. That's why he planted these two trees,
one of life and the other of death, so to speak. For it was because he had
eaten the fruit of the latter against the command of God, that man was
subjected to death. But from the moment that he touched the forbidden fruit,
sin entered the world, and man became subject to death, and to all the
infirmities of nature. Yet this death was in the divine counsels a grace even
more than a punishment; so the Lord would not allow Adam to inhabit the earthly
paradise. He drove him out of it, proving to him, by this very rigor, that he
acted only out of kindness and in his interest. But this doctrine requires a
deeper examination of this passage.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the Lord, let us fear that Adam advances his hand, and takes also the fruit of
the tree of life, and that he does not eat and live forever. It is as if he had
said: An excess of intemperance has led man to transgress my command, and his
sin has subjected him to death. So today, if he dared to touch the fruit of the
tree of life, he would acquire immortality and never stop sinning. That is why
it is to him that I chase him from the earthly paradise; and I will give it
rather a mark of goodness than anger and revenge. Thus spoke the Lord; and it
is true to say that his chastisements, as well as his benefits, show his mercy.
So this hard exile became for Adam a salutary lesson. For if God had not
foreseen that impunity would make men more guilty, he would not have driven
Adam out of earthly paradise. (108) But it was to prevent the progress of vice
in them and to close the way to a mischief that could not stop, that he chastised
Adam in a thought of mercy; and this is what he does every day with regard to
sinners.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">He therefore commanded,
out of benevolence and goodness, that man was driven out of the earthly
paradise. And the Lord God, says the Scripture, put Adam out of the garden of
delight, to plow the land from which he had been drawn. Notice here the
accuracy of the sacred writer. He tells us that the Lord God put Adam out of
the garden of delights, to plow the land from which he had been drawn. The
divine judgment then receives its execution, and the man, driven from the
garden of delights, was forced to work the land. Nor is it without reason that
Scripture adds: from whence he had been fired. For this work was to be for him
a continual lesson of humility, reminding him that his body had been formed of
the mud of the earth. So it is expressly said: That he should work the land
from which he was drawn. It is still like the consequence of this other word of
the Lord: You will eat your bread by the sweat of your brow, that Adam then
received the order to work the land from which he had been drawn.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Scripture then tells us
how far from the earthly paradise God establishes it, since it adds that the
Lord God drove out Adam, and made him live in front of the garden of delights.
But here, as in all his covers, God shows himself to be full of mercy, even
when he chastises us. So it is out of kindness and mercy that he casts Adam out
of earthly paradise; and if he then establishes it in the presence of this same
residence, it is so that each day he may conceive a new regret for his former
state, and a new grief for his present misfortunes. No doubt this view was very
sad and bitter to him, and yet he found there a useful lesson; for it made him
wiser and more vigilant, and prevented him from sinning. It is indeed all too
common for man to abuse the goods he enjoys, and to correct himself only when
he has lost them. For experience reveals to him his fault, and his misfortune
makes him appreciate the happiness from which he has fallen and feel the evils
that surround him. It was therefore on God's part a sign of providence and
goodness to establish Adam in the face of earthly paradise, since the sight of
this place was to sustain salutary remorse in him. Finally, to prevent him from
becoming too attached to life, he would try to return to the garden of delights
and eat the fruit of the tree of life, the Lord, according to the story of the
Scripture, narrative proportioned to our weakness, the Lord placed a cherub
with a flaming sword that was still moving, to keep the path of the tree of
life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The negligence of our
first parents in observing the divine commandment caused the Lord to guard the
entrance to paradise so carefully. And it is fair to observe that if his
goodness and mercy had already appeared when he banished Adam, they did not
burst any less when he placed a cherub with a flaming sword that kept moving to
keep the entrance of the garden of delights. It is not without reason also that
it is said of this sword that he was constantly agitating. For we understand by
this that all the roads that could lead to this garden were closed, and that
this blazing sword defended all approaches. But what memories he remembered,
and what terror he inspired to Adam! <b>[Homilies

is raised than that which is sown; and nothing else is sown than that which
decays in the ground; and it is nothing else than the flesh which is decayed in
the ground. For this was the substance which God's decree demolished,
"Earth you are, and to earth shall you return;" Genesis 3:19 because
it was taken out of the earth. And it was from this circumstance that the
apostle borrowed his phrase of the flesh being "sown," since it returns
to the ground, and the ground is the grand depository for seeds which are meant
to be deposited in it, and again sought out of it. And therefore he confirms
the passage afresh, by putting on it the impress (of his own inspired
authority), saying, "For so it is written;" 1 Corinthians 15:45 that
you may not suppose that the "being sown" means anything else than
"you shall return to the ground, out of which you were taken;" nor
that the phrase "for so it is written" refers to any other thing that

amusing us in speaking plurally, if He is One only and singular. Or was it to
the angels that He spoke, as the Jews interpret the passage, because these also
acknowledge not the Son? Or was it because He was at once the Father, the Son,
and the Spirit, that He spoke to Himself in plural terms, making Himself plural
on that very account? Nay, it was because He had already His Son close at His
side, as a second Person, His own Word, and a third Person also, the Spirit in
the Word, that He purposely adopted the plural phrase, "Let us make;"
and, "in our image;" and, "become as one of us." For with
whom did He make man? and to whom did He make him like? (The answer must be),
the Son on the one hand, who was one day to put on human nature; and the Spirit
on the other, who was to sanctify man. With these did He then speak, in the
Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses. [Against Praxeas 12]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Adam was by reason of his condition under law subject to death, yet was hope
preserved to him by the Lord's saying, "Behold, Adam is become as one of
us;" that is, in consequence of the future taking of the man into the
divine nature. Then what follows? "And now, lest he put forth his hand,
and take also of the tree of life, (and eat), and live for ever."
Inserting thus the particle of present time, "And now," He shows that
He had made for a time, and at present, a prolongation of man's life. Therefore
He did not actually curse Adam and Eve, for they were candidates for restoration,
and they had been relieved by confession. <b>[Against

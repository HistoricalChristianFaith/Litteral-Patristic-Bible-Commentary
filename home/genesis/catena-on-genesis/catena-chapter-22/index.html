God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I
am. 2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,
and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon
one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 3 And Abraham rose up early in
the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and
Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
unto the place of which God had told him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham
lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 5 And Abraham said unto his
young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and
worship, and come again to you, 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and
a knife; and they went both of them together. 7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham
his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said,
Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 8 And
Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so
they went both of them together. 9 And they came to the place which God had
told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 10 And Abraham
stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 11 And the angel
of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he
said, Here am I. 12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do
thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. 13 And Abraham lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns:
and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
the stead of his son. 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh:
as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</i></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Abraham. It is often asked how this can be true when James says in his letter
that God does not tempt anyone (Jas. 1:13). The answer is that the language of
Scripture often uses the word “tempt” with the meaning of “prove.” Instead, the
temptation spoken of by James is understood only as referring to that by which
one falls into the nets of sin. That is why the Apostle says: lest the tempter
should tempt you (1 Thess. 3:5). For it is written elsewhere: The Lord your God
tempts you to know if you love him (Deut. 13:3). Naturally, this expression
says: to know, as if it were said: “to make you know”, because the power of
love itself is hidden from man, if God does not make it known through a test of
his. [Question 57]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WORDS: I KNOW NOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD. — On these words: I know now that you fear
God. — an angel said from Heaven to Abraham: “Do not put your hand on the
child, and do nothing to him.” For I know that you fear God. This issue
resolves, like the previous one, by an analogy of expressions; For these words:
“I know now that you fear God” mean: now I make you known. This way of speaking
is clearly understood in the following text: “And Abraham called this place:
the Lord saw;” And it is said today: The Lord appeared on the mountain. He saw,
put for: He appeared (Gen. 22:14), has the same meaning as: he did see; The
cause is set for the effect; A cold numb, for: a cold that numbs. [Question 58]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">(Verse 12) WAS IT FOR THE
SAKE OF THE ANGEL, OR OUT OF RESPECT FOR GOD, THAT ABRAHAM WAS PREPARED NOT TO
SPARE HIS SON? — and for My sake you have not spared your beloved son. Is it
that Abraham did not spare his son by an angel or God? The solution is that
under the name of an angel it is to be understood that it was our Lord Jesus
Christ, who is undoubtedly God, and the prophet expressly calls him Angel of
Great Counsel (Is. 9:6), or that God was in the angel and the angel spoke in
name of God, as he usually does through the prophets. This latter sense appears
to be drawn more clearly in the following words of the text: “And the Angel of
the Lord called again Abraham from the top of heaven, saying: I sworn by
myself, says the Lord (Gen. 22:15-16).” It is difficult indeed to find that
here Christ engages God the Father as his Lord, in this time frame who preceded
the Incarnation. With regard to the form of slave that he has taken, this
expression seems not to be lacking in modesty. Indeed to prophesy this event it
is said in a psalm: “The Lord said to me: you are my son (Ps. 2:7).” But it is
difficult to discover in the Gospel itself, that Christ calls God the Father
his Lord, because this would be true, though he calls him God, in this passage
where they say: ” I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and to
your God. (Jn. 20:17);” As to these words of Scripture: “The Lord said to my
lord,” it is in the name of the one who speaks that they are uttered: “The Lord
said to my lord (Ps. 109:1),” that is, the Father told the Son. Thus these
other words: “The Lord made rain… from the Lord (Gen. 19:24; Lk. 17:29),” are

high, and the Hebrew says MORIA, luminous, according to Aquila, and the vision,
according to Symmachus. This mountain, say the Hebrews, is the one where the
temple was later founded on the Jebusite plateau of Orna, as it is written in
the Chronicles: "The second month and the second day of this month, they began
the erecting the temple on Mount Moria." (2 Chron. 3: 1) It is translated
as illuminating and luminous, because it is DABIR, that is, the oracle of God,

verse, saying sabech means a goat which, with its horns straight out, is
standing eret to graze the leaves of the tree. Then Aquila interpreted it as
suchneōna, which we can express as 'a thorn bush' or 'a thorn hedge' and, to
explain the actual force of the word, 'a very dense thicket entwined in
itself'. From this, Symmachus too is led to the same opinion and says: And
after this there appeared a ram caught by its horns in a net. But the
Septuagint and Theodotion seem to certain people to have a better
interpretation, at least in this place: they presented the word sabech as it
stands and say: by its horns in the thicket sabech. For suchneōn or 'net',
which Aquila and Symmachus put, is written with the letter sin; but here the
letter samech is used, from which it is clear that the word sabech is not an
explanation of very dense woods and thicket entwined in itself in the manner of
a net, but represents the name of the thicket which is pronounced in this way
in the Hebrew. But by searching carefully I have found that suchneōn is often
written with the letter samech.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

22:1-2)</font></a> A considerable gain is shown to us in today's reading, an ineffable
treasure concealed in such short words. Such is the character of divine
oracles: great riches are found there, not in the multitude of words, but in
the very brevity of expressions. Well, let's look at today's text, let's focus
on reading today. Thus we shall understand, better and better, and the perfect
virtue of the patriarch, and what is excellent in the clemency of God. After
that God tempted Abraham. What do these words mean: After that, did God tempt
Abraham? Observe, I pray you, as from now on, divine Scripture proposes to
discover the virtue of the just; she will tell us how Abraham was tempted by
God. But first, she wants us to know when the patriarch received the order that
commanded him to sacrifice Isaac; she wants you to understand the perfect
obedience of the patriarch, in what circumstances the patriarch has shown that
nothing is better than the command of God. What do these words mean: After
that? Because after the birth of Isaac, seeing Ishmael with Isaac, as we told
you yesterday, she could not endure this sight, and she said to Abraham,
"Hunt this maid with her son, for the son of this servant will not be heir
with my son. (Gen. 21:10) And as this word seemed harsh to the patriarch, God
willing to console him, said to him: Listen to Sarah, your wife, and do what
she has told you. You must not find hard what has been said to you concerning
your son and your servant: It is from Isaac that the race which is to bear your
name will come out. (Ibid. 12) will make him the leader of a great people,
because he is your race. And all the promises, made to him by God, were reduced
to the prediction that the children of Isaac would multiply so as to form a
great people. The righteous thus lived in this happy hope; After so many trials
so painful, after so many pains, having received his reward, finally enjoying
perfect security, seeing the heir who was to succeed him, he lived tranquilly,
happily, consoled. But he who knows the secrets of hearts, wanted to discover
the virtue of this just, the perfection of his love for God. And that is why,
after so many promises, after the last promise, all recent, whose memory was so
present to the spirit of Abraham; at the moment Isaac was already tall, in the
prime of life; at the moment when his father's love was growing; after this
promise, after saying, "The name of Isaac will come out of your name, and
he shall be your successor. After that, God tempted Abraham. What is it? It was
not because God did not know Abraham that he tempted him; he did not want to
test it; but God wanted, and that the men of the time of Abraham, and all those
who would follow each other, from this time to our days, learn, by the example
of the patriarch, to show the same love, the same obedience to precepts of the
Lord. And, saith the text, he saith unto him, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham
answered him, Here am I. What do these two words mean, Abraham, Abraham? Great
proof of the benevolence of the Lord for the patriarch. He showed him besides,
by the manner of calling him, that he had to communicate to him an important
order. So, to make him more attentive, he calls him twice, and he says to him:
Abraham, Abraham. And Abraham said to him, Here am I. And God said to him, Take
Isaac your beloved son, whom ye cherish, Isaac, and go up, and offer him a
burnt offering in one of the mountains that I will show you. (Gen. 22:2) It was
heavy to bear the weight of such an order; this is what surpasses human
strength: Take your beloved son, whom you cherish, Isaac. See how these words
light, activate the fire of the stake, the furnace of love, which the righteous
felt for his Isaac: Take your darling son, whom you cherish, Isaac. Each of
these words, alone, was enough to tear the soul of the righteous. God does not
just say, Isaac, but he adds your son; that against all odds you have begotten;
that you may have had in your old age; darling: your beloved child, whom you
cherish so tenderly, Isaac whom you expect, as your heir; I promised you that
your race would come out, which would multiply so much, that it would number in
number the multitude of stars, and the grains of sand, along the shore of the
sea. Well, it is itself: Take it, and go up, and offer it as a burnt offering
on one of the mountains that I will show you. It is astonishing how the
righteous could bear to hear these words: Well, it is himself, says God, your
much desired son; offer it as a sacrifice on one of the mountains. What does
the righteous do then his mind is not troubled; his thought is not confounded;
he does not hesitate for a single instant before a command which must have
struck him with stupor; he does not think, reason: What does that mean? He who,
against all odds, generously gives me posterity; who, listening only to his own
goodness, has vivified that which was dead, the sterility of Sarah; now that
the child has been fed on his milk, has grown up, is in the prime of life, here
he commands me to kill him, to offer him as a sacrifice when there are few
moments yet, He said to me, "Out of him will come forth the race that is
to bear your name; he now gives me contrary orders. And how will these promises
be fulfilled? How can it be that by cutting the root, one sees the branches
spreading; that by cutting down the tree, one draws fruit; that by desiccating
the source, rivers are made to spring forth? According to human reason, such
things are impossible; but everything is possible at the will of God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The right man, moreover,
did not make any of these reflections. Like a wise servant, suppressing all
human reasoning, he only took care of one thing, to accomplish, to fulfill the
command. And as a stranger to human nature, convinced that divine precepts must
prevail over every affection, every love, he hastened to fulfill the orders of
God. Abraham, says the text, got up before daybreak, prepared his donkey, took
with him two young servants, and Isaac his son, and having cut off the wood
that was to be used for the burnt offering, he went to the where God had told
him to surrender. There was the third day. (Gen. 22:3) See the clemency of the
Lord; like this long space to be crossed, it serves him to test the virtue of
the just man. Meditate, consider, in this long period of three days, what the
just man had to bear, thinking in himself, that he was ordered to kill, with
his own hands, this beloved son; to reveal this order to no one; and be
astonished at the admiration of so much piety and wisdom. As he knew the full
extent of this command, he did not communicate it to anyone, neither to the
servants, nor to Isaac himself; he was alone, sustaining in himself this
battle, as solid as the diamond, and he remained invincible, unshakeable in his
thoughts, without succumbing to countless excuses, full of love, full of zeal,
to obey the only sign of God . When he came to the place, looking up, saith the
text, Abraham saw the place afar off, and said unto his servants, Wait here
with the ass. (Gen. 22:4-5) See again here the perfect wisdom of the just man;
he wants to hide, even before his servants, always showing that it is with
ardor, with eagerness, with a jealous zeal, that he wishes to accomplish what
is pleasing to God. He knew well what was strange, unheard-of, the action he
had to accomplish himself; that no one before him had done anything like it. He
hides the action from his servants: He leaves them with the donkey: Wait here,
we will only go that far, my son and I, and after worshiping, we will come back
to you. (Gen. 22:5) He spoke thus, in ignorance of what was about to happen,
but it is certain that he made a prophecy, without knowing it perhaps. He spoke
to his slaves, perhaps to deceive them, to make them stay there; but later, the
patriarch was there with the child. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; he took the fire and the knife in his
hands, and they both walked together. (Gen. 22:6) O force of soul! O solidity
of spirit! And he put, says the text, on Isaac the wood of the sacrifice; and
he took the sword and the fire, and they went together. From what eyes did he
look at the child carrying the wood on which he was going? at the time to
immolate it? How could his hand carry fire and sword? His hand carried the
visible fire, but the inner fire inflamed his soul, devoured his heart,
persuaded him that his love for God would triumph, and inspired him this
thought, that he who already, in a manner superior to human nature, had made
father, could still operate now things that surpass the human reason. Consider
henceforth, I beseech you, more than this sensible fire, the internal fire
which gradually became more and more ardent, and inflamed the soul of the just.
Now Isaac said to Abraham his father, My father. (Gen. 22:7) This word alone was
enough to tear the bowels of the righteous man. Abraham answered him, What do
you want, my son? You call father the one who just now will not have a son; and
I call my son, the one who is about to be put on the altar, whom I will slit
with my own hands. Then the child said, "Behold, you are carrying fire,
and I, the wood, where is the victim to be slain? Where is the sheep for the
burnt offering? Consider here, I beg you, the torture of the just man; how did
he endure hearing these words? How was he able to respond to his child? How was
he not confused? How could he hide, not to reveal immediately, to his child,
what would happen? On the contrary, with a strong thought, a manly soul: The
Lord will provide the victim for the burnt offering, my son. (Gen. 22:8) See
here, again, without knowing it, prophesy what must happen. His answer seemed
made to deceive Isaac. It was presently, however, what was needed to satisfy
it; but what a lively and poignant pain he did not suffer, that father who
sought the words in his thought, who considered the beauty of his child, the
external beauty, the interior grace too, the beauty of his soul, his obedience,
worthy object of love, all this in this flower of youth! And they both came
together to the place of which God had spoken to him. (Gen. 22:9) They came,
says the text, to the top of the mountain which the Lord had indicated to him.
And there, Abraham set up an altar. Here I am struck again by an admiration
which amazes me, to see the courage of the just; how he had the strength to
build the altar, how he had enough energy, how he did not faint in this
terrible fight. On the contrary, he built the altar, and on the altar he put
the wood. He then bound Isaac, his son, to the altar, and Abraham stretched out
his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. (Gen. 22:10)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Let's not go here
lightly, my good. loved, pay attention to the word. Consider, meditate; how did
not his soul fly from his body; how, with his own hands, was he able to bind
and on the wood to place his beloved child, so worthy of love, his only son?
And Abraham, said the text, stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slay
his son. O piety! O courage! O persistence of love! O victorious reason of
human nature! He took, said the text, the knife, to immolate his son. Who
should excite our admiration here, strike us with stupor? The courage of the
patriarch, or the obedience of the child? He does not fight to escape, he does
not complain, he lets himself go, he obeys his father, he is a peaceful lamb
that is put on the altar, and the child waits, softly resigned, his hand from
his father. But once this soul, wholly to God, has shown the consumption of all
virtues without any failure, the goodness of the Lord is revealed and proves
that he did not want the child's death; that he rather wanted to manifest the
virtue of the just man. Just the crown, for the zeal of his will; sacrifice is
consumed in the thought of the patriarch. God is pleased with him, and now
declares to him his special affection. And the angel of the Lord, saith the
text, cried out from heaven, Abraham, Abraham! (Gen. 22:11) As he saw the
righteous all ready, on the point of completing the sacrifice, determined to
fulfill the Lord's command, from heaven, he shouted at him</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Abraham, Abraham, and it
is good to call him twice, to prevent the speed of the just man. And the voice
that is heard, holds the hand of the righteous who already slaughters the
child. And Abraham said, Here am I. And the angel said, Put not your hand on
the child, and do not do it. I. know now that you. fear God, because to obey
me, you have not spared your only son. (Gen. 22:12<b>)</b> Do not put your hand, says the text, on the child. I did not give
the command for the order to be fulfilled; I do not want your son to be slain
with your hands, but I want to make your obedience manifest before all men; so
do not do anything to him. It is enough for your will, and for this good will I
crown you, and I proclaim your glory. For now I know that you fear the Lord.
See, here, how discourse adapts to our infirmity. What! Is it true to say that
God until this moment was ignorant of the righteous man's righteousness, that
only from that moment on did he begin to know it, he, the Lord of all things?
the creatures? No; the text does not mean that it is from this moment only that
God knows the virtue of Abraham; but what does the text mean? It is now, he
says, that you have manifested to all, that you fear God sincerely from the
bottom of your heart. I did not need to know better my servant; but the action
you have just done will be, and for the men of today, and for the generations
to come, a teaching. For from that moment you have made known to all, that you
fear the Lord, and that you hasten to fulfill his commandments. Since you have
not spared your beloved son; because of me, that son who is so dear to you,
that you love so ardently, you have not spared him; because of me, because of
my commandment; you preferred my order to your son. Well, now I give you back
your son, because it is to reward you, that I promised you that your race would
extend through the centuries. Receive therefore the crown of your obedience,
and go away, for it is to the will that I bestow the crown; it is to the soul
that I bestow the rich rewards. You must realize what you said; and to your
servants and to Isaac; you promised them: After worshiping, we will come back.
Here you are going to accomplish it; When the child asked you, Where is the
sheep for the burnt offering? The Lord will provide the victim for the burnt
offering, you answered. Well! turn, he says, your eyes behind you, see the
victim you have predicted, whom you will sacrifice in the place of the child.
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind him a ram, which had taken hold
of his horns in the bush, and took it, and offered it for a sacrifice, instead
of Isaac his son. (Gen. 22:13) I have seen your piety, he says, well! what you
said to the child, I spared you. And taking it, said the text, he offered it as
a sacrifice instead of Isaac, his son. Have you understood the clemency of God?
The sacrifice was consummated, the patriarch manifested his piety; he brought
back the crown conquered by his good will; in bringing back Isaac, he has
returned a thousand times crowned.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now, this whole story was
the figure of the cross. This is why Christ said to the Jews: Abraham, your
father, has eagerly desired to see my day, he has seen it and has been filled
with joy. (Jn. 8:56) How did he see him, who lived so many years ago? He has
seen his face, he has seen the shadow; for just as here the ram was offered in
place of Isaac, so the spiritual Lamb was offered instead of the world. It was
necessary, indeed, a figure to portray the truth in advance. See, indeed, I
conjure you, my beloved, how the whole history of Christ is here figured in
advance. Only son on one side, only son of the other; darling son, on one side,
own son; darling son, on the other side, own son too; for this is my beloved
Son, in whom I have put all my affection. (Matt. 3:17) One was offered by his
father as a sacrifice; and the other, his father delivered him; This is what
the voice of Paul shouts to us: He who has not spared his own Son, but
delivered him to death for us all, will he not give us all things with him
also? (Rom. 8:32) So far we have only one figure; but then it is the truth,
which shows itself far superior to the figure; for the spiritual Lamb has been
offered for the whole world; he has purified the whole earth; he delivered men
from error, and brought them back to the truth; he has changed the earth to
make it heaven. It is not that he has changed the nature of the elements, but
that he has brought the heavenly virtues to the men who live on the earth. By
this, lamb, the worship of demons has been wiped out; by this lamb, it has
happened that men no longer adore stones and pieces of wood; that beings
endowed with reason no longer bow to insensible objects; that every error has
been banished, that the light of truth has enlightened the world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Do you understand the
excellence of the truth? Do you understand what is the shadow on the one hand,
on the other hand, the truth? And Abraham, says the text, called this place a
name which means the Lord sees. This is why it is still said today: The Lord
was seen on the mountain. (Gen. 22:14) See the piety of the righteous man; as
always he gives to the places names taken from the events which have been
accomplished there. He wishes to recall the visit that God made to him, to
engrave it, so to speak, on a column of brass; in the name he gives to the place.
From there he called this place a name that signifies the Lord sees. <b>[Homilies on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Before the knowledge of God was poured out on the earth, men could not make men
believe anything new and unheard of until then by confirming the promise by an
oath made in the name of him whose acquaintance they did not yet know
sufficient. But when this knowledge had spread, it was forbidden to swear in
the name of him in whom it was not permitted to suspect even the lie. That is
why the Savior no longer wanted his servants to swear an oath, he only
commanded them to behave always in such a way as to add faith to their words.
The oath is demanded only by the disloyalty or faithlessness of a deceitful
heart, as men are accustomed to deceive, one imagines that the fear of God will
inspire them with more respect for the truth, or that it will be enough for the
one who will be deceived and who, by the same, acquires the right to complain. <b>[Questions on the Old and New Testaments,

received the promises. And, in offering his son, he worshipped the Son of God.
And, being restrained from sacrificing Isaac, he saw the Messiah in the ram,
which was offered up instead as a sacrifice to God. The patriarch was tried,
through Isaac, not however that he was sacrificed, but He who was pointed out
in Isaiah; ‘He shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers he shall be speechless (Is. 53:7);’ but He took away the sin of
the world. And on this account Abraham was restrained from laying his hand on
the lad, lest the Jews, taking occasion from the sacrifice of Isaac, should
reject the prophetic declarations concerning our Savior, even all of them, but
more especially those uttered by the Psalmist; ‘Sacrifice and offering You
would not; a body You have prepared Me (Ps. 40:6);’ and should refer all such

of Melcha his wife, Aran's daughter; from whose stock Job descended, as it is
written in the introduction to his book: There was a man in the land of Us
whose name was Job. Certain people, therefore, are mistaken in thinking that
Job was of Esau's family: for what is contained in the conclusion of his book,
namely, that it was translated from the Syrian language; that he was fourth in
descent from Esau; and the rest of the things which are included, are not
contained in the Hebrew books. The second son born from Melcha was Buz, whom
the Septuagint have preferred to transcribe as Bauz. Now from this man's family
comes Balaam the soothsayer (so the Hebrews hand on the tradition) who in the
Book of Job is called Eliu. At first he was a holy man and a prophet of God;
but later, because of his disobedience and lust for rewards, in that he was
eager to curse Israel, he was dubbed with the description 'soothsayer'. And he
is spoken of in the same book: And Eliu the son of Barachiel the Buzite was
angry. Evidently, he descends from the stock of this Buz. Camuel is the father
of Damascus. For what is written here in the place of Syria is called Aran; and
by that same name it is read in Isaiah. And Chased is the fourth son, from whom
the Chasdim, that is, the Chaideans, were later named. <b>[Hebrew Questions on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

says he, by myself, in order to give you perfect confidence, that my words will

of faith for those to whom it is addressed. This is why the Lord pronounces
these words, conforming to human habits: I swear by myself that since you have
done this action, and that, to obey me, you have not spared your beloved son.
Consider, I conjure you, the clemency of the Lord. You have not spared, to obey
me, your beloved son. And yet he brings him back alive. Do not consider the
fact, my beloved, but the will, but the intention which made accomplish without
reasoning, without hesitation the order received. As to the will, the patriarch
had bloodied his hand; he had thrust the sword into the child's throat; he had
offered; consumed the sacrifice. The Lord looks upon the sacrifice as
consummated, and praises the righteous; And he said, To obey me, you have not
spared your beloved son. You, on your side, have not spared it by obedience;
but I, on my side, save it because of your obedience. And, to reward you for
this obedience: I will bless you, and, multiplying myself, I will multiply you.
See, the blessing is at its height; that is, I will multiply your race. He whom
your will has slain will spread your race, which will multiply to the point of
matching the stars of heaven and the sand: And all the nations of the earth
will be blessed in your race, because you have obeyed my voice. All these

Strengthened by these teachings, we, too, can show the obedience of this

Answer. He rested from the making and creation of new creatures, not from his
rule over the creatures made; and so God should be considered to have been then
a creator in the six-day-long creation, and to be now a ruler over the whole
world's creatures. <i>(Bed. in Pent., PL 91,

divide the number seven into one and six, these will be the first two perfect
numbers. Unity is perfect in itself in nature and power, while the number six
is the first perfect one in work and action, and is completed by its own parts,
because one, two, and three make six. So by the rest on the seventh day is
signified the fact that God, before the creation of the world, is perfect in
himself in nature and power, and eternally has rest in himself, while the
creatures, having received the action of creation from him, have through him a
certain perfection in their own natures and have rest in the work of obedience,

resting in their Maker.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

THE APPEARANCE OR SHAPE OF THE ARK TO HAVE BEEN LIKE? — Answer. It had, it
seems, four corners rising from the bottom, which gradually drew more and more
narrowly together as they approached the top, where the ark ended in the space
of one cubit. For it is related that in the bottom there were three hundred
cubits in length and fifty in breadth, and thirty in height, but ending in a
narrow top, of one cubit in length and in breadth. And, truly, no other shape
would have been as proper and suitable to be given to the ark as this was: with
the narrow top, as if with a sort of roof, it scattered the rainfalls, while it
stood in the bottom with the stability of the square so that neither the push
of the winds nor the violence of the waves nor the agitation of the animals
within could cause it to tilt or sink.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 105]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND IT TO HAVE BEEN TWO-CHAMBERED AND THREE-CHAMBERED? —
Answer. Two-chambered in the lower parts and three-chambered in the upper
parts, so that we perceive the dwellings in it were divided into five: its
lowest parts were destined to ordure and refuse, so that the animals, and more
especially the people, might not be troubled by the stench of excrements. The
chamber above and contiguous to this was destined to keep the animals' food.
These are the uses into which the lower parts, which are called two-chambered,
are said to have been divided. As for the upper parts, which are called
three-chambered, the first of them was destined as a dwelling for wild beasts,
fiercer animals, or serpents. After this, higher, were suitable rooms for
milder animals, and stables; and above it all, on high, was placed the dwelling
of men, because it was only natural that, just as man surpasses all animals in
honor and wisdom, he should be spatially placed above them too. And so it is
understood that there were five sets of quarters in the ark: the first for
ordure, the second for stores, the third for wild animals, the fourth for tame
ones, and the fifth for men.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><i><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">(Bed. Hexm. II, PL

THINGS TO HAVE BEEN WITH FISH OR BIRDS THAT CAN LIVE IN OR ON WATER? WERE THEY
IN THE ARK OR NOT? AND WHAT ABOUT VERY MINUTE INSECTS LIKE BUGS AND FLIES AND
THE LIKE? — Answer. Saint Augustine, in The City of God, book XV (chapter 27
paragraph 4) solves this problem as follows: "There is a customary inquiry
about the very minute creatures, not only such as mice and lizards, but also locusts,
beetles, flies, fleas, and so forth, whether there were not in the ark a larger
number of them than was determined by God in His command. First, those persons
who are moved by this difficulty are to be reminded that the words "every
creeping thing of the earth" only indicate that it was not needful to
preserve in the ark the animals that can live in the water, whether the fishes
that live submerged in it, or the sea-birds that swim on its surface. Then,
when it is said "male and female," no doubt reference is made to the
repairing of the races, and consequently there was no need for those creatures
being in the ark which are born without the union of the sexes from inanimate
things, or from their corruption; or if they were in the ark, they might be
there as they commonly are in houses, not in any determinate numbers; or if it
was necessary that there should be a definite number of all those animals that
cannot naturally live in the water, that so the most sacred mystery which was
being enacted might be bodied forth and perfectly figured in actual realities,
still this was not the care of Noah or his sons, but of God. For Noah did not
catch the animals and put them into the ark, but gave them entrance as they
came seeking it. For this is the force of the words, "They shall come unto
thee,"—not, that is to say, by man's effort, but by God's will."</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 115]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

construction of this city, that is, Babylon, is mentioned in the history of the

Trinity with the distinction of persons, and the unity of work in the divine

same syllables and letters of identical force, albeit put together differently,
in the various languages of the nations, and often even the same nouns or verbs
with one meaning in one language, and another meaning in another. Where we say
in the Psalm in virga ferrea ("with a rod of iron") (Ps. 2:9), the

ABRAHAM'S BROTHER, "ARAN DIED BEFORE THARE HIS FATHER IN UR OF THE
CHALDEES"? —Answer. "Ur" means "fire", and the
Chaldees worship fire as a god. Thare, according to the Hebrews, was thrown
into a fire with his sons by the Chaldees because he refused to adore fire, and
Aran was killed in that fire. This is what is meant now: "He died in the
sight of Thare his father", as Jerome relates in his book of Hebrew Questions
(Patr. tom. XXIII, col. 957), saying, "The Hebrews' tradition is true
which says that Thare and his sons went forth from the fire of the Chaldees and
that Abraham, surrounded with Babylonian fire, because he refused to adore it,
was saved by God's help. And the days of his life and the time of his age are
counted from that moment from which he confessed God, rejecting the idols of
the Chaldees." Thus a very obscure problem concerning Abraham is solved.
For we read that Thare begot Abraham when he was seventy [variant: 75] years
old and lived a hundred and thirty-five years after begetting Abraham, and that
all the days of Thare were two hundred and five years. We also read in Genesis,
"Abraham was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran"
(Gen. 12:4), that is, after the death of his father Thare. Therefore, from the
year of Abraham's birth to the year that he went forth from Haran, there are a
hundred and thirty-five years, but those years are not counted which passed
before he went out of the fire of the Chaldees, saved by God's protection. This
is what Jerome says.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

months and would spend six months using various perfumes in the care of women,
and only then would she go in to the king (Es. 2:12). Thus it is possible that
after Pharaoh took a liking to Sara, while her entrance to the king was being

IS THAT MELCHISEDECH KING OF SALEM, WHO THE APOSTLE SAYS IS WITHOUT FATHER AND
WITHOUT MOTHER? — Answer. The reason why the apostle said Melchisedech was
without father and without mother is that the holy Scripture does not tell his
genealogy. The Hebrews say that this Melchisedech is Sem, Noah's son, under a
different name, and, reckoning the days of his life, they show that he lived
until the time of Isaac. They also say that all firstborns used to be priests
and immolate sacrifices to God until the time of Aaron and the rites of the
law, and that this was the birthright that Esau sold his brother Jacob. It was
also right, they say, for Melchisedech to receive tithes from the triumphs of
his descendant. Moreover, they affirm that Salem is the same city that was
later called Jerusalem. This city, according to them, was even first called
Jebus, then Salem, then Jerusalem. This Melchisedech, according to the apostle,
symbolically represents Christ, because Christ is without mother in heaven and
without father on earth, offering to God, for us, on earth, the bread of his
body and the wine of his blood; to whom it is said, "Thou art a priest for
ever, according to the order of Melchisedech" (Heb. 5:6; Ps. 109:4).</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 164]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

had not yet been promulgated. Also, he had received from God the promise that
his seed would be multiplied, but he did not yet know from what wife, because
he was told only later that he would get a son from Sara. His wish thus to procreate
was a pious one, because his wish for sexual intercourse was not a lustful one.
Even Sara, being unable to have a child from herself, wished to have one from
her servant. Both [variant: She] agreed for this to be done, because both

WHAT WAS ABRAHAM TO UNDERSTAND BY THAT MYSTICAL SIGN CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF
HIS RACE? AND WHY DID HE HAVE TO TAKE THREE-YEAR-OLD ANIMALS? AND WHY DID HE
DIVIDE THE ANIMALS BUT NOT THE BIRDS? — Answer. The three-year-old animals
symbolize the three time divisions through which the people grew up to the
highest summit of honor. From the time of patriarch Abraham, through the
promises, to the time of Moses, the people was brought into a connection with
God. From the time of legislator Moses, it was glorified with the receiving of
the law from God, miraculous occurrences, triumphs, and the entering of the
Land of Promise. From the time of David, it was elevated with kingly honor and
the building of the temple and city of Jerusalem. The ram symbolizes kingly and
priestly dignity, the cow symbolizes the nation in bondage under the letter of
the law, and the goat indicates that that same nation is sinful. The birds, on
the other hand, prefigured spiritual people and God's elect. So the division of
the animals means that there are always schisms among carnal people, whereas
the fact that he did not divide the birds denotes the peace and unity among the
spiritual. The fact that fear fell upon Abraham towards the evening symbolizes
the terror in the day of judgement, which will separate the spiritual from the
carnal, setting the ones on the right and the others on the left (Matt. 25). As
for the birds fluttering over the carcasses, they are demons who seek to sit on
carnal people, and whom a devoted teacher ought to drive away through sedulous
warnings.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question

IS MEANT BY WHAT WAS SAID TO ABRAHAM, "KNOW THOU BEFOREHAND THAT THY SEED
SHALL BE A STRANGER IN A LAND NOT THEIR OWN, AND THEY SHALL BRING THEM UNDER
BONDAGE, AND AFFLICT THEM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS"? HOW WERE THOSE FOUR HUNDRED
YEARS OF BONDAGE CALCULATED? — Answer. It should not be taken to mean that
God's people was in that terribly hard bondage for four hundred years. It is
written, "in Isaac shall thy seed be called" (Gen. 21:12). From the
year of Isaac's birth to the year of the departure from Egypt are counted four
hundred and five years. So, when, from four hundred and thirty, you subtract the
twenty-five years that are from the promise to Isaac's birth, it is not
surprising if the Scripture decided to call the four hundred and five remaining
years four hundred, with a round sum, given that the Scripture often designates
periods of time without counting what little is above or below the sum of a
number's perfection. Then, "they shall reduce them to bondage and harm
them" should not be taken to refer to the four hundred years as if they
had kept them in bondage for so many years, but the four hundred years should
be taken to refer to "thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their
own", because, whether in the land of Canaan or in Egypt, that seed was a
stranger, until they took by inheritance the land according to God's promise,
which happened after they were freed from Egypt. Therefore a hyperbaton is here
understood: the logical word order is: "Thou shalt know that thy seed
shall be a stranger in a land not their own for four hundred years", and
it is understood that "and they shall reduce them to bondage and harm
them", was interposed without referring to the four hundred years. For it
was in the endmost part of this sum of years, namely, after Joseph's death,
that it came to pass that God's people went through hard bondage in Egypt.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 168]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

fourth generation. Take the genealogy of Levi: Levi begot Kohath, Kohath begot
Amram, Amram begot Aaron, Aaron begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Phinehas. Kohath
entered Egypt with his father Levi[; Eleazar returned from Egypt with his
father Aaron]. From Kohath to Eleazar are counted four generations. As for the
children of Israel leaving the land of Egypt in the fifth generation according
to Exodus, it is the sequence of the tribe of Judah that is counted there.
Judah begot Pharez, Pharez begot Hesron, Hesron begot Aram, Aram begot
Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, Nahshon begot Salmon. Pharez entered Egypt
with his father [Judah]; Nahshon is mentioned as the leader of Judah in the
desert, and his son Salmon entered the Land of Promise. Count from Pharez to

because the Lord had heard her humility ("Ismael" translates to
"the hearing of the Lord"). He shall be a wild man: his hand will be

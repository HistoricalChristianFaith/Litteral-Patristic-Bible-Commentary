understood that the word age has various meanings, for it denotes many things.
The life of each man is called an age. Again, a period of a thousand years is
called an age. Again, the whole course of the present life is called an age:
also the future life, the immortal life after the resurrection , is spoken of
as an age. Again, the word age is used to denote, not time nor yet a part of
time as measured by the movement and course of the sun, that is to say,
composed of days and nights, but the sort of temporal motion and interval that
is co-extensive with eternity. For age is to things eternal just what time is
to things temporal.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

are spoken of, that is, from the creation of the heaven and earth till the
general consummation and resurrection of men. For there is a partial consummation,
viz., the death of each man: but there is also a general and complete
consummation, when the general resurrection of men will come to pass. And the
eighth age is the age to come.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Before the world was
formed, when there was as yet no sun dividing day from night, there was not an
age such as could be measured , but there was the sort of temporal motion and
interval that is co-extensive with eternity. And in this sense there is but one
age, and God is spoken of as αἰνιος and προαιώνιος, for the age or æon itself
is His creation. For God, Who alone is without beginning, is Himself the
Creator of all things, whether age or any other existing thing. And when I say
God, it is evident that I mean the Father and His Only begotten Son, our Lord,
Jesus Christ, and His all-holy Spirit, our one God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But we speak also of ages
of ages, inasmuch as the seven ages of the present world include many ages in
the sense of lives of men, and the one age embraces all the ages, and the
present and the future are spoken of as age of age. Further, everlasting (i.e.
αἰ&amp; 240·νιος) life and everlasting punishment prove that the age or æon to
come is unending. For time will not be counted by days and nights even after
the resurrection, but there will rather be one day with no evening, wherein the
Sun of Justice will shine brightly on the just, but for the sinful there will
be night profound and limitless. In what way then will the period of one
thousand years be counted which, according to Origen , is required for the
complete restoration? Of all the ages, therefore, the sole creator is God Who
has also created the universe and Who was before the ages.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

good and more than good, did not find satisfaction in self-contemplation, but
in His exceeding goodness wished certain things to come into existence which
would enjoy His benefits and share in His goodness, He brought all things out
of nothing into being and created them, both what is invisible and what is

holy, and sacred, and gifted theologian, Dionysius the Areopagite , says, All
theology, that is to say, the holy Scripture, has nine different names for the
heavenly essences. These essences that divine master in sacred things divides
into three groups, each containing three. And the first group, he says, consists
of those who are in God's presence and are said to be directly and immediately
one with Him, viz., the Seraphim with their six wings, the many-eyed Cherubim
and those that sit in the holiest thrones. The second group is that of the
Dominions, and the Powers, and the Authorities; and the third, and last, is
that of the Rulers and Archangels and Angels.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Gregory the Theologian, say that these were before the creation of other
things. He thinks that the angelic and heavenly powers were first and that
thought was their function. Others, again, hold that they were created after
the first heaven was made. But all are agreed that it was before the foundation
of man. For myself, I am in harmony with the theologian. For it was fitting that
the mental essence should be the first created, and then that which can be
perceived, and finally man himself, in whose being both parts are united.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the angels are creators of any kind of essence whatever are the mouth of their

angelic powers was set over the earthly realm, and into whose hands God
committed the guardianship of the earth, was not made wicked in nature but was
good, and made for good ends, and received from his Creator no trace whatever
of evil in himself. But he did not sustain the brightness and the honour which
the Creator had bestowed on him, and of his free choice was changed from what
was in harmony to what was at variance with his nature, and became roused
against God Who created him, and determined to rise in rebellion against Him :
and he was the first to depart from good and become evil. For evil is nothing
else than absence of goodness, just as darkness also is absence of light. For
goodness is the light of the mind, and, similarly, evil is the darkness of the
mind. Light, therefore, being the work of the Creator and being made good (for
God saw all that He made, and behold they were exceeding good Genesis 1:31)
produced darkness at His free-will. But along with him an innumerable host of
angels subject to him were torn away and followed him and shared in his fall.
Wherefore, being of the same nature as the angels, they became wicked, turning
away at their own free choice from good to evil. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

reveals the future to the angels and commands them to prophesy, and so what
they say comes to pass. But the demons also make predictions, sometimes because

Scripture speaks of heaven, and heaven of heaven , and heavens of heavens , and
the blessed Paul says that he was snatched away to the third heaven 2
Corinthians 12:2, we say that in the cosmogony of the universe we accept the
creation of a heaven which the foreign philosophers, appropriating the views of
Moses, call a starless sphere. But further, God called the firmament also
heaven Genesis 1:8, which He commanded to be in the midst of the waters,
setting it to divide the waters that are above the firmament from the waters
that are below the firmament. And its nature, according to the divine Basilius
, who is versed in the mysteries of divine Scripture, is delicate as smoke.
Others, however, hold that it is watery in nature, since it is set in the midst
of the waters: others say it is composed of the four elements: and lastly,
others speak of it as a fifth body, distinct from the four elements. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Further, some have
thought that the heaven encircles the universe and has the form of a sphere,
and that everywhere it is the highest point, and that the centre of the space
enclosed by it is the lowest part: and, further, that those bodies that are
light and airy are allotted by the Creator the upper region: while those that are
heavy and tend to descend occupy the lower region, which is the middle. The
element, then, that is lightest and most inclined to soar upwards is fire, and
hence they hold that its position is immediately after the heaven, and they
call it ether, and after it comes the lower air. But earth and water, which are
heavier and have more of a downward tendency, are suspended in the centre.
Therefore, taking them in the reverse order, we have in the lowest situation
earth and water: but water is lighter than earth, and hence is more easily set
in motion: above these on all hands, like a covering, is the circle of air, and
all round the air is the circle of ether, and outside air is the circle of the
heaven.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Further, they say that
the heaven moves in a circle and so compresses all that is within it, that they
remain firm and not liable to fall asunder.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">They say also that there
are seven zones of the heaven , one higher than the other. And its nature, they
say, is of extreme fineness, like that of smoke, and each zone contains one of
the planets. For there are said to be seven planets: Sol, Luna, Jupiter,
Mercury, Mars, Venus and Saturn. But sometimes Venus is called Lucifer and
sometimes Vesper. These are called planets because their movements are the
reverse of those of the heaven. For while the heaven and all other stars move
from east to west, these alone move from west to east. And this can easily be
seen in the case of the moon, which moves each evening a little backwards.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">All, therefore, who hold
that the heaven is in the form of a sphere, say that it is equally removed and
distant from the earth at all points, whether above, or sideways, or below. And
by 'below' and 'sideways' I mean all that comes within the range of our senses.
For it follows from what has been said, that the heaven occupies the whole of
the upper region and the earth the whole of the lower. They say, besides, that
the heaven encircles the earth in the manner of a sphere, and bears along with
it in its most rapid revolutions sun, moon and stars, and that when the sun is
over the earth it becomes day there, and when it is under the earth it is
night. And, again, when the sun goes under the earth it is night here, but day
yonder.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Others have pictured the
heaven as a hemisphere. This idea is suggested by these words of David, the
singer of God, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain , by which word he
clearly means a tent: and by these from the blessed Isaiah, Who has established
the heavens like a vault Isaiah 40:22: and also because when the sun, moon, and
stars set they make a circuit round the earth from west to north, and so reach
once more the east. Still, whether it is this way or that, all things have been
made and established by the divine command, and have the divine will and counsel
for a foundation that cannot be moved. For He Himself spoke and they were made:
He Himself commanded and they were created. He has also established them for
ever and ever: He has made a decree which will not pass. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

then, is the first heaven which is above the firmament. So here we have two
heavens, for God called the firmament also Heaven. Genesis 1:8 And it is
customary in the divine Scripture to speak of the air also as heavens, because
we see it above us. Bless Him, it says, all you birds of the heaven, meaning of
the air. For it is the air and not the heaven that is the region in which birds
fly. So here we have three heavens, as the divine Apostle said. 2 Corinthians
12:2 But if you should wish to look upon the seven zones as seven heavens there
is no injury done to the word of truth. For it is usual in the Hebrew tongue to
speak of heaven in the plural, that is, as heavens, and when a Hebrew wishes to
say heaven of heaven, he usually says heavens of heavens, and this clearly means
heaven of heaven , which is above the firmament, and the waters which are above
the heavens, whether it is the air and the firmament, or the seven zones of the
firmament, or the firmament itself which are spoken of in the plural as heavens
according to the Hebrew custom.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

are brought into existence are subject to corruption according to the law of
their nature , and so even the heavens themselves are corruptible. But by the
grace of God they are maintained and preserved. Only the Deity, however, is by
nature without beginning and without end. Wherefore it has been said, They will
perish, but You endure : nevertheless, the heavens will not be utterly
destroyed. For they will wax old and be wound round as a covering, and will be
changed, and there will be a new heaven and a new earth Revelation 21:1 .</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that the heavens or the luminaries are endowed with life. For they are
inanimate and insensible. So that when the divine Scripture says, Let the
heavens rejoice and the earth be glad , it is the angels in heaven and the men
on earth that are invited to rejoice. For the Scripture is familiar with the
figure of personification, and is wont to speak of inanimate things as though
they were animate: for example , The sea saw it and fled: Jordan was driven
back. And again, What ailed you, O thou sea, that you fled, you, O Jordan, that
you was driven back ? Mountains, too, and hills are asked the reason of their
leaping in the same way as we are wont to say, the city was gathered together,
when we do not mean the buildings, but the inhabitants of the city: again, the
heavens declare the glory of God , does not mean that they send forth a voice
that can be heard by bodily ears, but that from their own greatness they bring
before our minds the power of the Creator: and when we contemplate their beauty
we praise the Maker as the Master-Craftsman. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

elements, light and with a greater tendency to ascend than the others. It has
the power of burning and also of giving light, and it was made by the Creator
on the first day. For the divine Scripture says, And God said, Let there be
light, and there was light. Genesis 1:3 Fire is not a different thing from what
light is, as some maintain. Others again hold that this fire of the universe is
above the air and call it ether. In the beginning, then, that is to say on the
first day, God created light, the ornament and glory of the whole visible
creation. For take away light and all things remain in undistinguishable
darkness, incapable of displaying their native beauty. And God called the light
day, but the darkness<span>  </span>He called night.
Genesis 1:5 Further, darkness is not any essence, but an accident: for it is
simply absence of light. The air, indeed, has not light in its essence. It was,
then, this very absence of light from the air that God called darkness: and it
is not the essence of air that is darkness, but the absence of light which
clearly is rather an accident than an essence. And, indeed, it was not night,
but day, that was first named, so that day is first and after that comes night.
Night, therefore, follows day. And from the beginning of day till the next day
is one complete period of day and night. For the Scripture says, And the

first three days the light was poured forth and reduced at the divine command,
both day and night came to pass. But on the fourth day God created the great
luminary, that is, the sun, to have rule and authority over the day: for it is
by it that day is made: for it is day when the sun is above the earth, and the
duration of a day is the course of the sun over the earth from its rising till
its setting. And He also created the lesser luminaries, that is, the moon and
the stars, to have rule and authority over the night, and to give light by
night. For it is night when the sun is under the earth, and the duration of
night is the course of the sun under the earth from its rising till its
setting. The moon, then, and the stars were set to lighten the night: not that
they are in the daytime under the earth, for even by day stars are in the
heaven over the earth but the sun conceals both the stars and the moon by the
greater brilliance of its light and prevents them from being seen.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">On these luminaries the
Creator bestowed the first-created light: not because He was in need of other
light, but that that light might not remain idle. For a luminary is not merely
light, but a vessel for containing light. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

seven planets among these luminaries, and these move in a direction opposite to
that of the heaven: hence the name planets. For, while they say that the heaven
moves from east to west, the planets move from west to east; but the heaven
bears the seven planets along with it by its swifter motion. Now these are the
names of the seven planets: Luna, Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

Creator appointed for them to run is unceasing and remains fixed as He
established them. For the divine David says, The moon and the stars which You
established , and by the word 'established,' he referred to the fixity and
unchangeableness of the order and series granted to them by God. For He
appointed them for seasons, and signs, and days and years. It is through the
Sun that the four seasons are brought about. And the first of these is spring:
for in it God created all things , and even down to the present time its
presence is evidenced by the bursting of the flowers into bud, and this is the
equinoctial period, since day and night each consist of twelve hours. It is
caused by the sun rising in the middle, and is mild and increases the blood,
and is warm and moist, and holds a position midway between winter and summer,
being warmer and drier than winter, but colder and moister than summer. This
season lasts from March 21st till June 24th. Next, when the rising of the sun
moves towards more northerly parts, the season of summer succeeds, which has a
place midway between spring and autumn, combining the warmth of spring with the
dryness of autumn: for it is dry and warm, and increases the yellow bile. In it
falls the longest day, which has fifteen hours, and the shortest night of all,
having only nine hours. This season lasts from June 24th till September 25th.
Then when the sun again returns to the middle, autumn takes the place of
summer. It has a medium amount of cold and heat, dryness and moisture, and
holds a place midway between summer and winter, combining the dryness of summer
with the cold of winter. For it is cold and dry, and increases the black bile.
This season, again, is equinoctial, both day and night consisting of twelve
hours, and it lasts from September 25th till December 25th. And when the rising
of the sun sinks to its smallest and lowest point, i.e. the south, winter is
reached, with its cold and moisture. It occupies a place midway between autumn
and spring, combining the cold of autumn and the moisture of spring. In it
falls the shortest day, which has only nine hours, and the longest night, which
has fifteen: and it lasts from December 25th till March 21st. For the Creator
made this wise provision that we should not pass from the extreme of cold, or
heat, or dryness, or moisture, to the opposite extreme, and thus incur grievous
maladies. For reason itself teaches us the danger of sudden changes.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that makes the seasons, and through them the year: it likewise makes the days
and nights, the days when it rises and is above the earth, and the nights when
it sets below the earth: and it bestows on the other luminaries, both moon and
stars, their power of giving forth light.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the twelve signs each month, since it occupies a lower position and travels
through the signs at a quicker rate. For if you draw one circle within another,
the inner one will be found to be the lesser: and so it is that owing to the
moon occupying a lower position its course is shorter and is sooner completed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now the Greeks declare
that all our affairs are controlled by the rising and setting and collision of
these stars, viz., the sun and moon: for it is with these matters that
astrology has to do. But we hold that we get from them signs of rain and
drought, cold and heat, moisture and dryness, and of the various winds, and so
forth , but no sign whatever as to our actions. For we have been created with
free wills by our Creator and are masters over our own actions. Indeed, if all
our actions depend on the courses of the stars, all we do is done of necessity
: and necessity precludes either virtue or vice. But if we possess neither
virtue nor vice, we do not deserve praise or punishment, and God, too, will
turn out to be unjust, since He gives good things to some and afflicts others.
Nay, He will no longer continue to guide or provide for His own creatures, if
all things are carried and swept along in the grip of necessity. And the
faculty of reason will be superfluous to us: for if we are not masters of any
of our actions, deliberation is quite superfluous. Reason, indeed, is granted
to us solely that we might take counsel, and hence all reason implies freedom
of will.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">And, therefore, we hold
that the stars are not the causes of the things that occur, nor of the origin
of things that come to pass, nor of the destruction of those things that
perish. They are rather signs of showers and changes of air. But, perhaps, some
one may say that though they are not the causes of wars, yet they are signs of
them. And, in truth, the quality of the air which is produced by sun, and moon,
and stars, produces in various ways different temperaments, and habits, and
dispositions. But the habits are among the things that we have in our own
hands, for it is reason that rules, and directs, and changes them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It often happens, also,
that comets arise. These are signs of the death of kings , and they are not any
of the stars that were made in the beginning, but are formed at the same time
by divine command and again dissolved. And so not even that star which the Magi
saw at the birth of the Friend and Saviour of man, our Lord, Who became flesh
for our sake, is of the number of those that were made in the beginning. And
this is evidently the case because sometimes its course was from east to west,
and sometimes from north to south; at one moment it was hidden, and at the next
it was revealed: which is quite out of harmony with the order and nature of the
stars.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It must be understood,
then, that the moon derives its light from the sun; not that God was unable to
grant it light of its own, but in order that rhythm and order may be
unimpressed upon nature, one part ruling, the other being ruled, and that we
might thus be taught to live in community and to share our possessions with one
another, and to be under subjection, first to our Maker and Creator, our God and
Master, and then also to the rulers set in authority over us by Him: and not to
question why this man is ruler and not I myself, but to welcome all that comes
from God in a gracious and reasonable spirit.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The sun and the moon,
moreover, suffer eclipse, and this demonstrates the folly of those who worship
the creature in place of the Creator Romans 1:25, and teaches us how changeable
and alterable all things are. For all things are changeable save God, and
whatever is changeable is liable to corruption in accordance with the laws of
its own nature.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now the cause of the
eclipse of the sun is that the body of the moon is interposed like a
partition-wall and casts a shadow, and prevents the light from being shed down
on us : and the extent of the eclipse is proportional to the size of the moon's
body that is found to conceal the sun. But do not marvel that the moon's body
is the smaller. For many declare that the sun is many times larger even than
the earth, and the holy Fathers say that it is equal to the earth: yet often a
small cloud, or even a small hill or a wall quite conceals it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The eclipse of the moon,
on the other hand, is due to the shadow the earth casts on it when it is a
fifteen days' moon and the sun and moon happen to be at the opposite poles of
the highest circle, the sun being under the earth and the moon above the earth.
For the earth casts a shadow and the sun's light is prevented from illuminating
the moon, and therefore it is then eclipsed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">It should be understood
that the moon was made full by the Creator, that is, a fifteen days' moon: for
it was fitting that it should be made complete. But on the fourth day, as we
said, the sun was created. Therefore the moon was eleven days in advance of the
sun, because from the fourth to the fifteenth day there are eleven days. Hence
it happens that in each year the twelve months of the moon contain eleven days
fewer than the twelve months of the sun. For the twelve months of the sun
contain three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days, and so because the
quarter becomes a whole, in four years an extra day is completed, which is
called bis-sextile. And that year has three hundred and sixty-six days. The
years of the moon, on the other hand, have three hundred and fifty-four days.
For the moon wanes from the time of its origin, or renewal, till it is fourteen
and three-quarter days' old, and proceeds to wane till the twenty-ninth and a
half day, when it is completely void of light. And then when it is once more
connected with the sun it is reproduced and renewed, a memorial of our
resurrection. Thus in each year the moon gives away eleven days to the sun, and
so in three years the intercalary month of the Hebrews arises, and that year
comes to consist of thirteen months, owing to the addition of these eleven
days. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

sun and moon and stars are compound and liable to corruption according to the
laws of their various natures. But of their nature we are ignorant. Some,
indeed, say that fire when deprived of matter is invisible, and thus, that when
it is quenched it vanishes altogether. Others, again, say that when it is
quenched it is transformed into air. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Genesis 1:2 For the deep is nothing else than a huge quantity of water whose
limit man cannot comprehend. In the beginning, indeed, the water lay all over
the surface of the earth. And first God created the firmament to divide the
water above the firmament from the water below the firmament. For in the midst
of the sea of waters the firmament was established at the Master's decree. And
out of it God bade the firmament arise, and it arose. Now for what reason was
it that God placed water above the firmament? It was because of the intense
burning heat of the sun and ether. For immediately under the firmament is
spread out the ether , and the sun and moon and stars are in the firmament, and

the heat. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Next, God bade the waters
be gathered together into one mass. Genesis 1:9 But when the Scripture speaks
of one mass it evidently does not mean that they were gathered together into
one place: for immediately it goes on to say, And the gatherings of the waters
He called seas Genesis 1:10: but the words signify that the waters were
separated off in a body from the earth into distinct groups. Thus the waters
were gathered together into their special collections and the dry land was
brought to view. And hence arose the two seas that surround Egypt, for it lies
between two seas. These collections contain various seas and mountains, and
islands, and promontories, and harbours, and surround various bays and beaches,
and coastlands. For the word beach is used when the nature of the tract is
sandy, while coastland signifies that it is rocky and deep close into shore,
getting deep all on a sudden. In like manner arose also the sea that lies where
the sun rises, the name of which is the Indian Sea: also the northern sea
called the Caspian. The lakes also were formed in the same manner.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The ocean, then, is like
a river encircling the whole earth, and I think it is concerning it that the
divine Scripture says, A river went out of Paradise. Genesis 2:10 The water of
the ocean is sweet and potable. It is it that furnishes the seas with water
which, because it stays a long time in the seas and stands unmoved, becomes
bitter: for the sun and the waterspouts draw up always the finer parts. Thus it
is that clouds are formed and showers take place, because the filtration makes
the water sweet.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

first divisions, that is to say, into four rivers. The name of the first is
Pheison, which is the Indian Ganges; the name of the second is Geon, which is
the Nile flowing from Ethiopia down to Egypt: the name of the third is Tigris,
and the name of the fourth is Euphrates. There are also very many other mighty
rivers of which some empty themselves into the sea and others are used up in
the earth. Thus the whole earth is bored through and mined, and has, so to
speak, certain veins through which it sends up in springs the water it has
received from the sea. The water of the spring thus depends for its character
on the quality of the earth. For the sea water is filtered and strained through
the earth and thus becomes sweet. But if the place from which the spring arises
is bitter or briny, so also is the water that is sent up. Moreover, it often
happens that water which has been closely pent up bursts through with violence,
and thus it becomes warm. And this is why they send forth waters that are
naturally warm.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

hollow places are made in the earth, and so into these the waters are gathered.
And this is how mountains are formed. God, then, bade the first water produce
living breath, since it was to be by water and the Holy Spirit that moved upon
the waters in the beginning Genesis 1:2, that man was to be renewed. For this
is what the divine Basilius said: Therefore it produced living creatures, small
and big; whales and dragons, fish that swim in the waters, and feathered fowl.
The birds form a link between water and earth and air: for they have their
origin in the water, they live on the earth and they fly in the air. Water,
then, is the most beautiful element and rich in usefulness, and purifies from
all filth, and not only from the filth of the body but from that of the soul,
if it should have received the grace of the Spirit. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

four elements, dry, cold, heavy, motionless, brought into being by God, out of
nothing on the first day. For in the beginning, he said, God created the heaven
and the earth Genesis 1:1: but the seat and foundation of the earth no man has
been able to declare. Some, indeed, hold that its seat is the waters: thus the
divine David says, To Him Who established the earth on the waters. Others place
it in the air. Again some other says, He Who hangs the earth on nothing. Job
26:7 And, again, David, the singer of God, says, as though the representative
of God, I bear up the pillars of it , meaning by “pillars” the force that
sustains it. Further, the expression, He has founded it upon the seas , shows
clearly that the earth is on all hands surrounded with water. But whether we
grant that it is established on itself, or on air or on water, or on nothing,
we must not turn aside from reverent thought, but must admit that all things
are sustained and preserved by the power of the Creator.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In the beginning, then,
as the Holy Scripture says Genesis 1:2, it was hidden beneath the waters, and
was unwrought, that is to say, not beautified. But at God's bidding, places to
hold the waters appeared, and then the mountains came into existence, and at
the divine command the earth received its own proper adornment, and was dressed
in all manner of herbs and plants, and on these, by the divine decree, was
bestowed the power of growth and nourishment, and of producing seed to generate
their like. Moreover, at the bidding of the Creator it produced also all manner
of kinds of living creatures, creeping things, and wild beasts, and cattle.
All, indeed, are for the seasonable use of man: but of them some are for food,
such as stags, sheep, deer, and such like: others for service such as camels,
oxen, horses, asses, and such like: and others for enjoyment, such as apes, and
among birds, jays and parrots, and such like. Again, among plants and herbs
some are fruit bearing, others edible, others fragrant and flowery, given to us
for our enjoyment, for example, the rose and such like, and others for the
healing of disease. For there is not a single animal or plant in which the
Creator has not implanted some form of energy capable of being used to satisfy
man's needs. For He Who knew all things before they were, saw that in the
future man would go forward in the strength of his own will, and would be
subject to corruption, and, therefore, He created all things for his seasonable
use, alike those in the firmament, and those on the earth, and those in the
waters.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

transgression all things were under his power. For God set him as ruler over
all things on the earth and in the waters. Even the serpent was accustomed to
man, and approached him more readily than it did other living creatures, and
held intercourse with him with delightful motions. And hence it was through it
that the devil, the prince of evil, made his most wicked suggestion to our
first parents. Genesis 3:1 Moreover, the earth of its own accord used to yield
fruits, for the benefit of the animals that were obedient to man, and there was
neither rain nor tempest on the earth. But after the transgression, when he was
compared with the unintelligent cattle and became like to them , after he had
contrived that in him irrational desire should have rule over reasoning mind
and had become disobedient to the Master's command, the subject creation rose
up against him whom the Creator had appointed to be ruler: and it was appointed
for him that he should till with sweat the earth from which he had been taken.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

are not without their uses, for, by the terror they cause, they bring man to
the knowledge of his Creator and lead him to call upon His name. And, further,
at the transgression the thorn sprung out of the earth in accordance with the

that it might lead us to remember the transgression on account of which the
earth was condemned to bring forth for us thorns and prickles. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now when God was about to
fashion man out of the visible and invisible creation in His own image and
likeness to reign as king and ruler over all the earth and all that it
contains, He first made for him, so to speak, a kingdom in which he should live
a life of happiness and prosperity. And this is the divine paradise , planted
in Eden by the hands of God, a very storehouse of joy and gladness of heart
(for “Eden” means luxuriousness ). Its site is higher in the East than all the
earth: it is temperate and the air that surrounds it is the rarest and purest:
evergreen plants are its pride, sweet fragrances abound, it is flooded with
light, and in sensuous freshness and beauty it transcends imagination: in truth
the place is divine, a meet home for him who was created in God's image: no creature
lacking reason made its dwelling there but man alone, the work of God's own
hands.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In its midst God planted
the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Genesis 2:9 The tree of knowledge
was for trial, and proof, and exercise of man's obedience and disobedience: and
hence it was named the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, or else it was
because to those who partook of it was given power to know their own nature.
Now this is a good thing for those who are mature, but an evil thing for the
immature and those whose appetites are too strong , being like solid food to
tender babes still in need of milk. For our Creator, God, did not intend us to
be burdened with care and troubled about many things, nor to take thought
about, or make provision for, our own life. But this at length was Adam's fate:
for he tasted and knew that he was naked and made a girdle round about him: for
he took fig-leaves and girded himself about. But before they took of the fruit,
They were both naked, Adam and Eve, and were not ashamed. Genesis 2:25 For God
meant that we should be thus free from passion, and this is indeed the mark of
a mind absolutely void of passion. Yea, He meant us further to be free from
care and to have but one work to perform, to sing as do the angels, without
ceasing or intermission, the praises of the Creator, and to delight in
contemplation of Him and to cast all our care on Him. This is what the Prophet
David proclaimed to us when He said, Cast your burden on the Lord, and He will
sustain you. And, again, in the Gospels, Christ taught His disciples saying,
Take no thought for your life what you shall eat, nor for your body what you
shall put on. Matthew 6:25 And further, Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and
His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. And to Martha
He said, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things: but
one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be
taken away from her Luke 10:41-42, meaning, clearly, sitting at His feet and
listening to His words.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The tree of life, on the
other hand, was a tree having the energy that is the cause of life, or to be
eaten only by those who deserve to live and are not subject to death. Some,
indeed, have pictured Paradise as a realm of sense , and others as a realm of
mind. But it seems to me, that, just as man is a creature, in whom we find both
sense and mind blended together, in like manner also man's most holy temple
combines the properties of sense and mind, and has this twofold expression:
for, as we said, the life in the body is spent in the most divine and lovely
region, while the life in the soul is passed in a place far more sublime and of
more surpassing beauty, where God makes His home, and where He wraps man about
as with a glorious garment, and robes him in His grace, and delights and
sustains him like an angel with the sweetest of all fruits, the contemplation
of Himself. Verily it has been fitly named the tree of life. For since the life
is not cut short by death, the sweetness of the divine participation is
imparted to those who share it. And this is, in truth, what God meant by every
tree, saying, Of every tree in Paradise you may freely eat. Genesis 2:16 For
the 'every' is just Himself in Whom and through Whom the universe is
maintained. But the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was for the
distinguishing between the many divisions of contemplation, and this is just
the knowledge of one's own nature, which, indeed, is a good thing for those who
are mature and advanced in divine contemplation (being of itself a proclamation
of the magnificence of God), and have no fear of falling , because they have
through time come to have the habit of such contemplation, but it is an evil
thing to those still young and with stronger appetites, who by reason of their
insecure hold on the better part, and because as yet they are not firmly
established in the seat of the one and only good, are apt to be torn and
dragged away from this to the care of their own body.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Thus, to my thinking, the
divine Paradise is twofold, and the God-inspired Fathers handed down a true
message, whether they taught this doctrine or that. Indeed, it is possible to
understand by every tree the knowledge of the divine power derived from created
things. In the words of the divine Apostle, For the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made. Romans 1:20 But of all these thoughts and speculations the
sublimest is that dealing with ourselves, that is, with our own composition. As
the divine David says, The knowledge of You from me , that is from my
constitution, was made a wonder. But for the reasons we have already mentioned,
such knowledge was dangerous for Adam who had been so lately created. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The tree of life too may
be understood as that more divine thought that has its origin in the world of
sense, and the ascent through that to the originating and constructive cause of
all. And this was the name He gave to every tree, implying fullness and indivisibility,
and conveying only participation in what is good. But by the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, we are to understand that sensible and pleasurable
food which, sweet though it seems, in reality brings him who partakes of it
into communion with evil. For God says, Of every tree in Paradise you may
freely eat. Genesis 2:16 It is, me-thinks, as if God said, Through all My
creations you are to ascend to Me your creator, and of all the fruits you may
pluck one, that is, Myself who art the true life: let every thing bear for you
the fruit of life, and let participation in Me be the support of your own
being. For in this way you will be immortal. But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof
you shall surely die. For sensible food is by nature for the replenishing of
that which gradually wastes away and it passes into the drought and perishes:
and he cannot remain incorruptible who partakes of sensible food.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">In this way, then, God
brought into existence mental essence , by which I mean, angels and all the
heavenly orders. For these clearly have a mental and incorporeal nature:
“incorporeal” I mean in comparison with the denseness of matter. For the Deity
alone in reality is immaterial and incorporeal. But further He created in the
same way sensible essence , that is heaven and earth and the intermediate
region; and so He created both the kind of being that is of His own nature (for
the nature that has to do with reason is related to God, and apprehensible by
mind alone), and the kind which, inasmuch as it clearly falls under the
province of the senses, is separated from Him by the greatest interval. And it
was also fit that there should be a mixture of both kinds of being, as a token
of still greater wisdom and of the opulence of the Divine expenditure as
regards natures, as Gregorius, the expounder of God's being and ways, puts it,
and to be a sort of connecting link between the visible and invisible natures.
And by the word “fit” I mean, simply that it was an evidence of the Creator's
will, for that will is the law and ordinance most meet, and no one will say to
his Maker, “Why have You so fashioned me?” For the potter is able at his will
to make vessels of various patterns out of his clay Romans 9:21, as a proof of
his own wisdom.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Now this being the case,
He creates with His own hands man of a visible nature and an invisible, after
His own image and likeness: on the one hand man's body He formed of earth, and
on the other his reasoning and thinking soul He bestowed upon him by His own
inbreathing, and this is what we mean by “after His image.” For the phrase
“after His image” clearly refers to the side of his nature which consists of
mind and free will, whereas “after His likeness” means likeness in virtue so
far as that is possible.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Further, body and soul
were formed at one and the same time , not first the one and then the other, as

evil, upright, virtuous, free from pain and care, glorified with every virtue,
adorned with all that is good, like a sort of second microcosm within the great
world , another angel capable of worship, compound, surveying the visible
creation and initiated into the mysteries of the realm of thought, king over
the things of earth, but subject to a higher king, of the earth and of the
heaven, temporal and eternal, belonging to the realm of sight and to the realm
of thought, midway between greatness and lowliness, spirit and flesh: for he is
spirit by grace, but flesh by overweening pride: spirit that he may abide and
glorify his Benefactor, and flesh that he may suffer, and suffering may be
admonished and disciplined when he prides himself in his greatness : here, that
is, in the present life, his life is ordered as an animal's, but elsewhere,
that is, in the age to come, he is changed and — to complete the mystery—
becomes deified by merely inclining himself towards God; becoming deified, in
the way of participating in the divine glory and not in that of a change into
the divine being. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

nature sinless, and endowed him with free will. By sinless, I mean not that sin
could find no place in him (for that is the case with Deity alone), but that
sin is the result of the free volition he enjoys rather than an integral part
of his nature ; that is to say, he has the power to continue and go forward in
the path of goodness, by co-operating with the divine grace, and likewise to
turn from good and take to wickedness, for God has conceded this by conferring
freedom of will upon him. For there is no virtue in what is the result of mere
force. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

alien to it; (for as the eye to the body, so is the mind to the soul); further
it enjoys freedom and volition and energy, and is mutable, that is, it is given
to change, because it is created. All these qualities according to nature it

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Marg. That man has
community alike with inanimate things and animate creatures, whe ther they are
devoid of or possess the faculty of reason.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Man, it is to be noted,
has community with things inanimate, and participates in the life of
unreasoning creatures, and shares in the mental processes of those endowed with
reason. For the bond of union between man and inanimate things is the body and
its composition out of the four elements: and the bond between man and plants
consists, in addition to these things, of their powers of nourishment and
growth and seeding, that is, generation: and finally, over and above these
links man is connected with unreasoning animals by appetite, that is anger and
desire, and sense and impulsive movement.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">There are then five
senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. Further, impulsive movement
consists in change from place to place, and in the movements of the body as a
whole and in the emission of voice and the drawing of breath. For we have it in
our power to perform or refrain from performing these actions.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Lastly, man's reason
unites him to incorporeal and intelligent natures, for he applies his reason
and mind and judgment to everything, and pursues after virtues, and eagerly
follows after piety, which is the crown of the virtues. And so man is a
microcosm.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Moreover, it should be
known that division and flux and change are peculiar to the body alone. By
change, I mean change in quality, that is in heat and cold and so forth: by
flux, I mean change in the way of depletion , for dry things and wet things and
spirit suffer depletion, and require repletion: so that hunger and thirst are natural
affections. Again, division is the separation of the humours, one from another,
and the partition into form and matter. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But piety and thought are
the peculiar properties of the soul. And the virtues are common to soul and
body, although they are referred to the soul as if the soul were making use of
the body.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The reasoning part, it
should be understood, naturally bears rule over that which is void of reason.
For the faculties of the soul are divided into that which has reason, and that
which is without reason. Again, of that which is without reason there are two
divisions: that which does not listen to reason, that is to say, is disobedient
to reason, and that which listens and obeys reason. That which does not listen
or obey reason is the vital or pulsating faculty, and the spermatic or
generative faculty, and the vegetative or nutritive faculty: to this belong
also the faculties of growth and bodily formation. For these are not under the
dominion of reason but under that of nature. That which listens to and obeys
reason, on the other hand is divided into anger and desire. And the unreasoning
part of the soul is called in common the pathetic and the appetitive. Further,
it is to be understood, that impulsive movement likewise belongs to the part
that is obedient to reason.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The part which does not
pay heed to reason includes the nutritive and generative and pulsating
faculties: and the name “vegetative ” is applied to the faculties of increase
and nutriment and generation, and the name “vital” to the faculty of pulsation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Of the faculty of
nutrition, then, there are four forces: an attractive force which attracts
nourishment: a retentive force by which nourishment is retained and not
suffered to be immediately excreted: an alternative force by which the food is
resolved into the humours: and an excretive force, by which the excess of food
is excreted into the draught and cast forth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">The forces again ,
inherent in a living creature are, it should be noted, partly psychical, partly
vegetative, partly vital. The psychical forces are concerned with free
volition, that is to say, impulsive movement and sensation. Impulsive movement
includes change of place and movement of the body as a whole, and phonation and
respiration. For it is in our power to perform or refrain from performing these
acts. The vegetative and vital forces, however, are quite outside the province
of will. The vegetative, moreover, include the faculties of nourishment and
growth, and generation, and the vital power is the faculty of pulsation. For
these go on energising whether we will it or not.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Lastly, we must observe
that of actual things, some are good, and some are bad. A good thing in
anticipation constitutes desire: while a good thing in realisation constitutes
pleasure. Similarly an evil thing in anticipation begets fear, and in
realisation it begets pain. And when we speak of good in this connection we are
to be understood to mean both real and apparent good: and, similarly, we mean
real and apparent evil.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

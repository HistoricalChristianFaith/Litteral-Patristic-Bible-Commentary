Manichaeans, two books on Genesis, in which I expounded the words of the divine
Scripture in an allegorical sense, I did not dare to explain to the letter so
great secrets of the things of nature, it is to say, in what way they could
take the things that are said there in true historical sense; that is why I
wanted to try now what my strength was in this laborious and difficult matter,
but this attempt to re-expose the Sacred Scriptures in a literal sense failed
under the weight of such an enormous burden. And even though I had not finished
a book, I stopped working, because I saw that I could not stand it. When making
the retraction of my tracts, it came to my hands this same as it was,
incomplete; the one he had certainly not made public and who had determined to
break it; since later I wrote twelve that they take by title: On the Genesis to
letter. And although in them it appears rather that they ask many more things
than they are, however they can not be compared to this one. Certainly, after
having corrected it, I wanted to keep it, so that it would be, I believe, a
non-useless index of my beginnings in the investigation and exposition of the
divine word. I wanted your title to be incomplete Book of Genesis to the
letter. I found it written up to the words "the Father is only Father, the
Son is only Son, because, when the likeness of the Father is said, although it
is revealed that there is no dissimilarity between the two, nevertheless the
Father is not alone it has similarity ». Then (before adding to numbers 16 and
62) I repeated the words of the divine Scripture that again had to be
considered and treated: And God said: Let us make man in our image and
likeness. So far I had written this incomplete book. The two numbers that follow
I thought it convenient to add them when making your review; However, not with
this I completed it, but even with this addition I left it incomplete. If I had
completed it, I would at least have written of all the works and words of God
that pertain to the sixth day. It seemed superfluous to note in this book the
things that displease me or defend those that, not being well understood by
others, despise them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

natural things, which we judge to be made by God, omnipotent Artificer, must be
treated not affirming, but seeking what is true; and mainly in the books that
the divine Authority entrusts to us, in which the temerity of affirming an
insecure and doubtful opinion, hardly avoids the sin of sacrilege; however, the
uncertainty of finding such secrets should not exceed the terms of the Catholic
faith. But as many heretics are accustomed to exposing the divine Scriptures,
adapting them to their opinions, which are against the faith of Catholic
doctrine, before presenting this book, the Catholic faith must be briefly
proposed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Almighty Father made and ordained every creature through his Only Begotten Son,
that is, through his wisdom and co-eternal and coeternal power with Him, in
unity of the Holy Spirit also consubstantial and co-eternal with Him. The
doctrine Catholic teaches us to believe that this Trinity is one God, and that
He created and formed, as they are, all things that exist, in such a way that
every creature, whether intellectual and corporal, or to put it more briefly
according to the words of the divine Scripture, visible or invisible, was not
formed of the nature of God, but made out of nothing, by God; and there is nothing
in it that belongs to the Trinity, except that the Trinity created it and it
was created; therefore, it is not lawful to say that the universal creature is

same faith that all things, made by God, are extremely good, that natural evils
do not exist, but that everything that is called evil or sin or penalty of sin;
that sin would not exist if we did not direct the evil consent of the free
will, and from which we can freely abstain, to those things that justice
forbids; that is to say, that sin is not in things, but in the misuse of them.
Therefore, the use of things is legitimate when the soul remains in the law of
the Lord and surrenders to the one God with perfect love, and administers all
things delivered to her without levity and without sensuality, that is,
according to the mandate of God; in this way the soul, without difficulty and
without work, will govern with great ease and joy. The penalty, then, of sin,
is that the soul is tormented by creatures, since they no longer serve him as
he does not serve God either; before, when she obeyed God, all creatures obeyed
her. Therefore, fire is not an evil, because it is a creature of God, although,
nevertheless, it burns our weakness in virtue and punishment of sin. Also
natural or proper sins are those who before necessarily helping us the mercy of
God necessarily commit after having fallen into this misery by the sin of free
will.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

faith that man was renewed through Our Lord Jesus Christ, when the ineffable
and immutable wisdom of God deigned to take the whole man and be born of the
Virgin Mary by virtue of the Holy Spirit and be crucified and buried. and to
rise and rise to the heavens, what has already happened; and come to judge the
living and the dead at the end of the world, and to raise the flesh of the
dead, which is announced as a thing to come. He also confesses that the Holy
Spirit is given to those who believe in Him, who was instituted by Him, our mother,
the Church, who is called Catholic because it is spread throughout the world
and is universally perfect and in no way surrenders. Finally, he teaches that
he first remits and forgives sins to penitents, and then promises the kingdom
of heaven and eternal life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

written: in the beginning God made heaven and earth, he may ask himself if it
should be understood only according to the historical sense, or also if it
means something figuratively; also in what way it agrees with the Gospel, and,
finally, why this book begins like this. According to the historical sense it
is asked what meaning it has in the beginning, namely: whether we should
understand it as the beginning of time or the Principle, that is, the Wisdom of
God, because also the Son of God called himself Principle when He was
interrogated: Who are you? and he answered: the Principle that spoke to you1.
There is, then, a Principle without a principle, and a Principle with another Principle.
Principle without principle is only the Father and by this we believe that all
things exist because of a single Principle; but the Son is in such a way
Principle that by generation comes from the Father. The same first intellectual
creature can also call it a principle, since it is the head of all those that
God made. And because with all property the head is called the beginning, for
this reason the Apostle did not say at that graduation that the woman was the
head of some; but the man said it was the head of the woman. and the head of
the male Christ, and the head of Christ the God, 2 and thus the creature is
united to the Creator.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">7. Was it said at the
beginning because it was the first thing that was done? Or is it that the first
heaven and earth could not be made among the creatures, if the angels and all
the intellectual powers were made in the first place? Because it is necessary
that we believe that the angels are creatures of God and that they were made by
Him, because also the angels listed the prophet among the creatures of God in
Psalm 148, when he said: He commanded and they were made. He commanded it and
they were created3; But if the angels were created before everything else, it
may be asked: were they created in time or before time or at the beginning of
time? If they were created in time, time existed before the angels were
created; and since time is also a creature, we see ourselves in the precision
of admitting that before the angels something began to exist; and if we say
that they were created at the beginning of time in such a way that at the same
moment that time began to exist, we will say that what some claim is false is
that time began when heaven and earth were made.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">8. But if the angels were
created before time, it must be investigated in what sense and why it was said
in the following verses: and God said to make the luminaries in the firmament
of heaven so that they illuminate the earth and divide the day and the night
and signal the times, the days and the years; because, according to this, it
may seem that then began the times when the sky and the luminaries of heaven
began to move in their determined orbits. If this is true, in what way could
the days be before time existed, if the time had its origin at the beginning of
the luminaries, which is said to have been done on the fourth day? Or is it
that this distribution of days, according to the custom of speaking of human
weakness, was ordered according to the norm or requirement of narrating and
insinuating with simplicity the sublime things to the humble, for which it
happens that the same discourse The speaker can not exist if they do not occupy
some words at the beginning, others the middle and others the end? Or perhaps
it was said that the luminaries were created in these times that men measure by
the movement of bodies with intervals of duration? But these times would not
exist, if there were no movement of bodies, but they are well known by men. If
we admit this we see ourselves in the precision of asking whether out of the
movement of bodies there can be time in a movement of disembodied creature,
such as the soul or the mind; it moves in his thoughts and by this movement in
it one thing is first and another final; which can not be understood without a
time interval. If we admit this kind of time, it can also be understood that
time was made before heaven and earth existed, if angels were created before
heaven and earth, since there already existed a creature that constituted time
with incorporeal movements, and clearly it will be understood that with it time
existed, as in the soul, which is accustomed to notice the bodily movements
through the senses of the body; but perhaps this does not happen in the higher
and very eminent creatures. Whatever may be of this, since it is a very occult
thing and impenetrable to human conjectures, the only certain thing that must
be maintained as of faith, although it exceeds the lights of our intelligence,
is that every creature has a beginning, and that time is a creature and therefore
consists of principle and is not coeternal to the Creator.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">9. It can also be
understood that perhaps the sky and the earth were named, comprising the
universal creation; in such a way that this sky was called visible and ethereal
sky, and that invisible creature of excelentísimo to put; and earth to the
lower part of the world with all the animals that inhabit it. Or was it called
heaven to every sublime and invisible creature, and earth to all the visible,
in such a way that what was said could be understood: in the beginning God made
heaven and earth by the universal creation? Perhaps properly and in comparison
with the invisible creature is called earth to all the visible, and sky to the
invisible, understanding the soul in the visible even though she is invisible,
since by losing herself in the love of visible things and being enriched with
the possession of them, it was called earth as it is written: why are you
proud, earth and ashes?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">10. It may be asked if by
chance heaven and earth were called all things already distinct and ordered, or
the name of heaven and earth was given principally to that report which is the
subject of all things, which was formed, commanded by God ineffably, in these
natures that we see formed and beautiful; for although we read what is written:
that you made the world of material matter5, however, we can not say that the
same matter, in whatever form and form it exists, was not made by Him, from the
moment we believe and confess that He comes from everything; and this is the
world called this separation and ordering of each of the things formed and
different, and is called heaven and earth to the same matter report, as if it
said that it was the seed of heaven and earth; heaven and earth that being as
mixed and disordered were fit to receive the forms from the Creator, God. It is
enough with what we have investigated so far on what is written: in the
beginning God made heaven and earth, since it is not advisable to recklessly
affirm anything about these points.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

therefore, invisible and in disarray, and the darkness occupied the abyss and
the Spirit of God was carried on the waters. The heretics who oppose the Old
Testament often criticize this passage when they say: how did God in the
beginning do heaven and earth, if the earth already existed? They do not
understand that this was added, in order to explain in what state was the land
named above when saying: God made heaven and earth. Thus, in the beginning God
made heaven and earth, it must be understood that this earth made by God was
invisible and reportable until by the same Lord it was divided, and removing it
from the confusion constituted it in an orderly state of visible things . Or
perhaps it is better understood saying that it is remembered again in this
execution, the same matter of things that it previously designated with the
name of heaven and earth, so that by saying in the beginning God made heaven
and earth he understands that what he called heaven and earth was a certain
material matter from which the world would be made, which consists, ordered the
elements and received the form, of two great parts, namely, of heaven and
earth; and so this intelligence of matter could be made known to any
intelligence, however rude, by calling it an invisible and unformed earth or
without order and beauty, and saying that the darkness was over the abyss, that
is, over the immense depth, which It was once again named, because it could not
be understood by any intelligence because of its very information.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">12. And the darkness was
over the abyss. Was the abyss placed below and the darkness above, as if there
were already different places? Or would it be said, since it is still about the
materiality of matter, which in Greek is called chaos, that the darkness was
over the abyss since light existed? If it had existed, it would certainly be on
top, because it is more eminent, and would illuminate all the things that are
placed beneath it. Indeed, the one who carefully investigates what darkness is
does not find more than a lack of light. Then he said the darkness was over the
abyss as if it had been said there was no light over the abyss. Therefore, this
matter, which by the subsequent work of God is already distinguished by the
formation of things, was called an invisible and reportless earth and depth
lacking in light, which was previously designated with the name of heaven and
earth, as if it were, as has been said, the seed of heaven and earth. Or
perhaps he wanted, when he said heaven and earth, to give us first to know the
universality of things, and then to insinuate the matter, to announce to us the
work of the formation of the beings of the world.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">13. And the Spirit of God
was carried on the waters. Up to the present Scripture had not said that God had
made the water, and yet, in no way can we believe that the water was not made
by God and that it did not exist before He made something ordered, because He
is of who, by whom and in whom are all things, as the Apostle affirms6; Then
God made the water, and to believe otherwise is a big mistake. Why was not it
said that God had already made the water? Was it because he wanted to call
water the same matter that he called the name of heaven and earth, and also
that of invisible and unformed earth, and abyss? Why, then, could it not be
called water, if it could be called earth, being that until then it was not
water, different and formed, neither earth, nor anything else? Perhaps it was
first called heaven and earth, then invisible and unformed earth, and, finally,
with all property water; in such a way that in the first place the matter of
that universal creation was designated, under the name of heaven and earth,
because it was made out of nothing; and in second term with the name of
disordered earth and abyss, to insinuate the informidad, because between all
the elements the earth is the grossest and the least noble of all; and thirdly
with the name of water, in order to indicate the subject to the action of the
artificer, since water is more formable than the earth, and thus by the ease of
being worked and by allowing itself to be transformed more easily, by in the
hands of the artificer, it was more properly called water than land.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">14. Air is certainly more
subtle than water. Ether with foundation is believed or judged to be more
subtle than air, but air or ether would be called more improperly matter,
because it is judged that these elements are more endowed with the power of
action, and land and water of passion; but if this is still a secret, I judge
very clearly that the wind moves water and many other earthly things; but the
wind is the movement of the air and like its own restlessness. But it being
evident that the air moves the water, however, the cause by which it is moved
to be wind is hidden; Who will doubt then that the water to be moved receives
with more property the name of matter, than the air that moves? Being moved is
the same as receiving an action, and moving is doing something; from this it
follows that the things that the earth begets are irrigated with water, so that
they can be born and reach their perfect development; in such a way that it
almost seems that water is transformed into things that are born, for which
reason water is more rightly called, since it implies being subject to the work
of the architect (because of its adaptability and convertibility in the bodies
that are born), that air, in which only mobility can be noticed, lacking other
qualities for which it would more accurately represent matter. Then the
complete meaning is: in the beginning God made heaven and earth, that is,
matter, which could receive the perfect form of heaven and earth, whose
material was invisible and disordered earth, that is, report and immense abyss
without light. Being subject to the action of modeling and the work of the
artificer, it was also called water, by its own obedience to the operant.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">15. Giving all these
meanings to matter, the end of it is implied in the first place, that is, what
it was made for; in the second term the same information, and lately the
servitude and submission to the architect. Thus, by indicating to us that the
matter had been made, he first called it heaven and earth; then, invisible and
reportless earth and darkness over the abyss, that is to say, lack of light,
for which reason it was called invisible earth; and, finally, he calls it
water, subject to the spirit and apt to receive the forms and figures
determined and visible. For this reason the Spirit of God was carried on the
water, so that we understand that the Spirit was the one who worked; and the
waters, that is, the fabricable material, the place where it worked. When we
say, then, that these three names, matter of the world, matter report,
manufacturable matter, are denominations of a single thing, we imply that the
first of them fits very well the sky and earth, the second the dark ,
confusion, depth, darkness; and to the third the one of adaptability on which
the Spirit of the artificer was brought to work.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">16. And the Spirit of God
was carried on the water. It was not borne in the way water supports oil; or
earth to water, that is, as if it held him. If we are to take from the visible
things examples to understand this, we will say that the Spirit of God was thus
borne, as this light of the sun or the light of the moon, which illuminates the
earth, is borne by the terrestrial bodies, not being contained or enclosed in
them, but if the sky contains it, it is borne by them; we must also avoid
believing that the Spirit of God was carried over matter occupying places. He
was carried by a certain active and operative power in order that whatever he
had to endure was made and manufactured; in such a way that the will of the
craftsman on the wood or on any other material destined to make something of
it, is endured, or also as the members of the body bear the will that mobilizes
them to act. This resemblance, nevertheless, being as it is of greater
excellence than any body, hardly takes place and almost does not serve at all
to clarify to us the excelentísimo power of the Spirit of God, to whose virtue
the matter of the world is subject to act in her; but we do not find a clearer
and more appropriate similarity to evidence the subject matter than these
things, which can in any case be understood by men. Therefore, in these
intellectual investigations, we must take into account that precept of
Scripture: those who bless God exalt him as much as you can, because he is
still higher. This was written so that we understand in this passage by the
Spirit of God the Holy Spirit, whom we worship in the ineffable and immutable
Trinity.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">17. Spirit of God can
also be understood in another sense; judging him as a vital creature, in which
this visible world with all its bodies was contained and moved, to which
Almighty God granted a certain power that would serve him to work in those
things that were produced. This spirit with property would be called Spirit of
God, being as it is more excellent than any ethereal body, since every
invisible creature surpasses all that is corporal and visible. Are not things
created by God from God? Certainly so, for when speaking of the earth it was
said: God is the earth and all the things that it contains8; and speaking of
the universal set of beings, it is said: O Lord, you love souls, you are all
things! 9 Then the word spirit can be understood in this way that I said, if we
believe that what was said in the God made heaven and earth principle, only
refers to the visible or material creature; and so, then, it was carried on the
matter of visible things, at the beginning of its creation, the invisible
spirit, which was also a creature, that is, it was not God, but nature made and
formed by God. But if we believe that the matter announced under that word of
"water" includes the universal creation, namely, the intellectual,
animal and bodily creature, in no way can Spirit of God be understood in this
place, but by that Immutable Spirit and Holy that was carried on the matter of
all things, which God made and perfected.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">18. A third opinion can
be originated from this word spirit: to judge that under the name of spirit the
air element is expressed, so that the four elements of which this visible world
is composed, namely, heaven, earth, will be named here water and air; not
because they existed apart and ordered, but because in the confusion still
report of that matter, were, however, predetermined to be created from it,
whose confusion and information was given the name of abyss and darkness. But
whatever is true of these sentences, it must be believed that God is the author
and creator of all the things that have appeared, both visible and invisible,
not in terms of the vices they may have against nature, but insofar as it
belongs to the same natures, for there is absolutely no creature that has not received
from God the principle of being and the perfection of its own kind and
substance.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

there be light and light was made. We should not believe that by saying God let
the light be said by a voice emitted by the lungs, teeth and tongue, but
ineffably it was said let there be light. Carnales would be such thoughts, and
to understand carnally, is a death10. We can ask (excluding this impiety,
namely, that the Word of God, the only begotten Son is the voice that is uttered,
like our verb), if this was said it was said by the Only Begotten Son, or the
Only Begotten Son is that which was said, because the Word of God, by whom all
things were created, is called Verbo. The Word of God by whom all things were
made, neither began to be, nor will it cease to be: begotten without beginning,
coeternal to the Father. Therefore, if that which was said let there be light,
it began to be said and finished to be said, we understand that this word was
said by the Son before she herself is the Son, however, this was also ineffably
said. Do not slip into the soul some carnal idea and torment the holy and
spiritual thought; it is a reckless and dangerous opinion to understand, in the
proper sense, that in the nature of God something begins and ceases to exist;
tolerable opinion in children and carnal, not to remain in it, but to be like
the beginning of a resurgence to the fullness of truth. Everything that is said
of God, which begins or ends, in no way is to be understood what happens in the
nature of God, but in his creature, which is subject to him in a wonderful way.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

there be light. Is it the light that hurts these carnal eyes or some other
hidden one that we are not allowed to contemplate with the eyes of the body?
And if it is hidden, will it be bodily and will it perhaps expand in the
highest parts of the world? Or is it disembodied, as is the soul, to which
belongs the examination of what is to be avoided and what is should it be
desired by the bodily senses, of which the souls of the beasts are also
lacking? Or is it the most excellent that manifests itself in reasoning and
that is the beginning of everything that has been created? Whatever light is
meant in this word we must believe that it has been made and created, and that
it is not that light by which the same Wisdom of God shines, which is not
created but begotten by Him. Do not believe that God was without light until He
created this one that we are dealing with now; because of this, as the same
words show, it is commanded to be done, for they say: and God said: let there
be light, and the light was made, One is the light begotten by God and another
made by Him; the birth of God is the same Wisdom of God, the one made by Him is
any other changeable whether corporeal or incorporeal.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

absolutely impossible is that man can understand if there is any other light
outside of heaven, which, however, diffuses and spills through space and
encompasses the world. But as we are allowed here to understand a disembodied
light, if we say that this book does not speak only of the visible creature,
but of universal creation, why dwell on this controversy? Perhaps what men
seek, when they ask when the angels were made, have meaning in this light, in a
way that is certainly concise, but also very convenient and very rational.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the part of God before an unheard-of and strange good, but as an indication of
the approval of the work. Because what more properly is said about God, insofar
as it can be expressed by men, that when these three words are written, it was
said, it was done, it pleased him, it is understood that in that word that was
written, he said, the domain is insinuated of God; and in which it was
consigned, it was done, its power declared; and in which he stamped himself,
did he like to show his kindness? Since these ineffable things had to be
communicated through man to men, so they must also express themselves so that
they could take advantage of everyone.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

light of darkness. Here the clarity with which these things of the divine works
were executed is clearly manifested, because there is no man to whom it occurs
to him that in such a way the light was mixed with the darkness, and,
therefore, it was necessary to separate them. after. For the same reason that
light was made, the division between light and darkness was followed. Because
what company can there be between them? 12 Then God separated the light from
the darkness when he made the light. The absence of this is called darkness.
The difference between light and darkness is the same as between the one who is
clothed and naked, or between what is full and empty, and other things like
that.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">24. We have already said
how many ways the word light can be understood, and also that the privations of
it can be called darkness. One is the light that is seen with the eyes of the
body, which is also corporeal, as for example that of the sun, that of the
moon, that of the stars and some other, if it exists, of the same gender.
Opposed to this kind of light are the darknesses, which are where this is not
found. There is a light by which we perceive life and it helps us to distinguish
the things that are transmitted by the body to the judgment and criterion of
the soul, such as white or black, melodious or hoarse, of pleasant or smelly
smell, sweet or bitter, hot or cold, and others of the same species. One is the
light that is perceived by the eyes and the other that makes us feel for them.
It resides in bodies; This, although it perceives through the body the things
that it feels, resides in the soul. The darkness, contrary to this, is the
insensibility or, to put it better, the lack of the sensitive faculty, that is,
they are not feeling, although the things that could be felt were introduced
into the sense, if that being were to be given. , this light or this sensitive
faculty, for which you feel. This sensitivity is not lacking when the body has
no senses, as happens in the blind and deaf, since in their souls there is this
light that we are dealing with now; what they only lack are the body's senses.
Nor is this sensitivity lacking, just as the sound is lacking in silence when the
voice is not heard; this light is found in the soul, and only the soul lacks
the means of the body, not what the feeling produces; then although for these
reasons he does not feel, he does not lack light for that reason. When the soul
of this power lacks, it is no longer usually called this being, soul, but only
life, as it is that which the trees, the vines and any other kind of plants
manifest; unless we may come to believe that these plants have such a life, for
not a few heretics disparaging to the extreme, grant them not only sensitivity
through the body, that is, sight, hearing, the distinction between fire and the
heat, but also the understanding; and they say they know our reason and
distinguish our thoughts. But dealing with these things is another matter. Then
the insensibility is the darkness of this light, and these take place when any
living being lacks the faculty of feeling. Thus, it is granted that this
faculty is properly called light, which grants that we can call light the
faculty by which things are perceived. When we say "it is evident that
this is pleasant, that this is sweet, that this is cold", and so of the
other sensations that we perceive by the senses of the body, then the light by
which we perceive these things is certainly inside the soul, although through
the senses of the body are introduced into it the things that in this way feel.
The third kind of light that exists in creatures can be said to be the one
through which we reason; the darkness opposite to this light is the irracionabilidad,
as they are the souls of the beasts.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">25. The primordial
meaning that the Scripture wishes to convey about light, whether it is the
etheric, whether of the sensory of which the beasts participate, or of the
rational one that is common to angels and man, it is that it was created by God
in the nature of things; that God divided the light of darkness by the mere
fact of having created the light; that it is also important not to forget that
light is one thing and deprivation of light is another; that God ordained light
and darkness. However, it was not said that God created darkness, because He
made beings, but not the lack of being, which belongs to nothingness. Hence, by
the Artificer God all things were made, which we also understand were arranged
in order by Him, when it was said: and God separated the light from the
darkness, not that regulating and administering God all things, not they had
their order the same privations. As in the song some moderate intervals of
silence intervene, and although they are privations of voice, nevertheless,
they are admirably ordered by those who know how to sing, giving the whole song
a certain melody; and as the shadows make the most important of them stand out
in the painting, and they do not please for their beauty, but for the order in
which they are placed, so God is not the author of our vices, but he orders
them when he places the sinners in their own place and forces them to suffer
the penalties deserved by them, applying to the effect the Gospel passage: the
sheep will be placed on the right and the kids on the left13. Then certain
things God creates and orders them, others just order them. God does and
commands the righteous; to sinners, in how much they are sinners, God does not
do them, he orders them only, since he places the first on the right, and the
left on the second; by commanding these to go to eternal fire he does so taking
into account the merits. Thus, He makes and orders the natures and forms of
things and only orders, does not do, the privations of the forms and defects of
the natures; therefore, let there be light and light was made, but it was not
said to do darkness and darkness was made. Of these two things he did, then,
one, the other not: but he ordered both to separate God from the light of
darkness. In short, doing it, everything is beautiful; By ordering Him,
everything is beautiful.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

light day and the darkness night. Since the words, light and day, names of the
same thing, and the words darkness and night, names of another, it was agreed
to call each thing with these two names, so that the thing to which the name
was imposed could also be called by another name, without being able to mean
anything else. And so it was said: God called the light day so that
indifferently it could also be said backwards, God called day light and night
darkness. But what will we answer to the one who asks us? Did the name of day
prevail or the name of light prevail? These two words, as soon as they are
pronounced with a human voice in order to signify something, are names. In the
same way you can ask about the other two, that is, did the name of night or of
darkness have darkness been given? According to what Sacred Scripture narrates,
it is clear that in the light the name of day was given and darkness was
imposed the name of night, because by saying he did. God the light and divided
the light of darkness, it was not yet a matter of assigning names; later, then,
the names day and night were used. But being as they are without doubt the
words light and darkness, also mean things, the same as day and night; It is
evident that you can not enunciate otherwise a thing that has received a
denomination, if not by some name. Or is it that this denomination is to be
taken as if it were the same division that God made? Not all light is day nor
all darkness is night, for it is designated by the names of oía and de noche to
light and darkness, which are ordered and divided among themselves with certain
alternations. Every word is used to designate a thing, for which the name that
designates the object is called as denotante or sign. Denote, then, that is,
point and continually help to discern. Perhaps the same having divided the
light and the darkness, is the same as calling the light day and the darkness
night, so that having ordered these things is having called them. Or is it that
these words want to suggest to us what he called light and what darkness, as if
he said God made light and divided the light of darkness; and in the light he
called it day and the darkness he called night, so that you do not believe that
it is another light that is not the day nor of other darknesses that are not
the night? Because if all light could be understood by day and all the darkness
under the name of roche, then perhaps there would have been no need to say: and
God called day and night darkness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

day and night it is. If you want to understand this day that begins with the
birth of the sun and ends with its hiding, and from this night that extends
from sunset to the birth of the sun, I can not find how this could have been,
before the luminaries of heaven. Or is it that perhaps these spaces of hours
and times, without alteration of glare and shadow, could already be called that?
But and in what way then does it agree with that rational or irrational light,
if in these words is understood this change that by the names of day and night
is meant? Or is it that, not according to what happens, but according to what
can happen, these things are insinuated because error and a certain incapacity
of sense can take over reason?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

made and the morning was made, one day. It is not called here day in the same
way as when it was said and called God in the light of day, but in the same way
that we say, for example, of thirty days the month consists, in these days we
also include the nights, but previously it was said day to separate it from the
night. Thus, as that work of creation implied what was done during the light of
day, it is rightly said that the afternoon was made and the morning was done,
which they completed one day; One day was completed from the beginning of one
day until the beginning of the other, that is, from the morning of one day to
the morning of the next day, to whose days, as I said, added the nights, we
called days. But how was the evening made and how was the morning done? Did God
need so much space to make light and separate it from darkness as it stretches
out in the light of day, that is, not counting the night? And if God needs time
to execute something, then how do you understand what is written: to you is
subject, when you want, the power? 14 Or is it that all things are finished in
God, as Are they in reason and in art, not with extension of time, but in the
same virtue by which it makes things stable, those that we contemplate but not
permanent? It is not credible that as in our conversation, where some words
come first and then the others follow each other, happens in art, which, working
steadily in conversation, makes a speech beautiful. Then, although there is no
need of time for God to work (to whom the power is subject, when he wants),
however, the temporal natures temporarily execute their movements. Therefore
perhaps it was said: and the larde was made and the morning was made one day,
first as it understands the reason that it could or should have been done in
this way, but not in the way it is done in time intervals. Who said: he who
abideth eternally created all things at once, 15 contemplated, in the same
inspiration, the work in his mind, but very comfortably ordered in that book
the narration of the things done by God in intervals of time, in order that the
true disposition of created things, which could not be comprehended with a
permanent gaze by the souls of less scope, exposed in this way of speaking,
would see it as with the carnal eyes.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

firmament be made in the midst of the water and divide the water and the water,
and so it was done; And God made the firmament and divided the water that was
under the firmament of the water that was above the firmament, were the waters
that were above the firmament equal to those visible that were below the
firmament? Or is it that in that water seems to be signified the one that
carried the Spirit of God and, therefore, we must understand that it was the
same matter of the world, in such a way that the inferior is the corporal
matter and the superior the animal, since it was divided because the sky was
interposed? Let's not forget that it calls firmamento to this that later it
calls heaven. Among the bodies there is no better than the celestial body,
because although some are the celestial bodies and others the terrestrial ones,
nevertheless, the best ones are the celestial ones; and everything that goes
beyond the nature of the celestial bodies I do not know how it can be called a
body. So perhaps it is a certain virtue or power subject to reason, by which is
known God and the truth whose nature, because it is formable through virtue and
prudence, with whose vigor is inhibited and moderates the fluctuation of it ,
appears as material; and, therefore, rightly it is called water by God,
exceeding the sphere of corporeal heaven, not by its bodily magnitude, but by
virtue of its disembodied nature. But by reason of having been called the
firmament heaven, it is not an absurdity to understand that everything that is
below the etheric sky, in which all things are calm and stable, is more
dissoluble and changeable. There were those who believed that these visible and
cold waters completely enveloped the surface of the sky and, therefore, also to
this kind of corporeal matter formed before receiving distinction and species
by what was called firmament. They put as proof the delay of one of the seven
wandering stars (which is greater than the others, and it is called by the
Greeks fainon (the brilliant one) and it takes thirty years to turn around its
orbit), saying that it is slow march because it is closer to the cold waters,
which are above the sky. I do not know how this opinion can be defended by
those who ingeniously sought such reasons. Nothing, then, recklessly has to be
affirmed in these things, but all of them must be treated with moderation and
caution.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

have to add again, and did God make the firmament and divide the water that was
under the firmament and the water that was above the firmament? Why in saying
up, and God said let there be light and light was made, did not add, and God
made light; but here after saying, and God said; let it be done, and so it was
done, it was added, and did God? Is it that there it manifests that it was not
convenient to understand that that light was bodily light, so that it would not
appear that God (and when I say here God understood the Trinity) did it through
some creature? When it comes to this firmament of heaven, because it is bodily,
it is believed perhaps that it has received beauty and form by means of the
incorporeal creature, in such a way that the incorporeal nature was rationally
imprinted by the Truth what it would physically imprint. to make the firmament
of heaven, and for this reason it was written: and God said, let it be done,
and so it was done. Perhaps, I repeat, the firmament was first made in the same
rational nature, by which the form was later printed to the body.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

afterward he adds: and God divided the light from the darkness and called the
light day and the darkness night. Here (on the second day), after he narrated
the event, the quo was already finished, and after calling heaven heaven, it is
said: And God saw that it was good. If the mode of expression was not changed
to avoid disturbing the reader, we are forced to understand it in the sense
that God did all things at the same time. Why, when speaking of light, first he
saw that it was good, and then he named it, and here when he spoke of the
firmament he named it first and then saw that it was good? Surely this
difference shows that in the operation of God there are no time intervals,
although these are found in the same works. According to these intervals of
time, one thing is done first and another after and without them the narration
of the facts can not be exposed, although without them God could have done
these things. And the afternoon was done and the morning was done, the second

waters that are under the sky come together in their single aggregate and the
arid appear And so it was done. Here, probably, we can believe, as we judge,
that the water previously mentioned was the same matter of the world; because
if the universe was completely covered with water, where or in what place could
it be assembled? But if I had called with the name of water some material
confusion of water, this meeting of now is to be understood as the same
formation, so that it would be such a kind of water as we see now. Also that
which was added, arid appears, can be understood by the formation of the earth,
so that the earth would then acquire this form with which we see it now,
because it was said that it was invisible and reportable, when the matter still
lacked form . Therefore, God said: congréguese the water that is under the sky,
that is, take body matter so that this water is what we perceive now. In a
single set, here under the name of unity, the same power or energy of the form
is proposed to us, since to form certainly is to gather something into a whole,
and the highest unit is the beginning of all form. And the arid appears, that
is, receives the earth visible, determined and without confusion; rightly the
water gathers for the arid to appear, that is, the sea is forbidden to
fluctuate so that the one that was hidden may be manifested. And so it was
done, perhaps this was first done in the reasons of the intellectual nature, so
that what was said later, and the water was gathered in a single set and the
arid was discovered, it does not appear to have been added superfluously, when
it had already been said and so it was done, but so that we understood that
after the rational and disembodied operation, the corporeal one was also

earth be the herb of food that bears seed according to its kind and likeness,
and fruitful tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself after its
likeness. After the earth and the sea were formed, and after they received the
names and were found good by God, what I have often repeated that should not be
understood at intervals of time so that there is no delay to the ineffable
power of God operative , was not added immediately after, as in the two
previous days, the afternoon was made and the morning was done and they
completed the third day, but another work was added: germinate the ground food
grass that carries seed according to its kind and likeness, and fruit tree that
begets fruit whose seed is in itself according to its likeness. This was not
said of that light, nor of the firmament, nor of the waters, nor of the arid,
for the light has no children to succeed it, nor is the sky born from another
heaven, or the earth and the sea beget other lands or seas that replace these;
then here, where the likeness of those who are born perpetuates the likeness of
those who die, it should be said that they bear seed according to their gender
and whose seed is in itself according to their likeness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

thus on the earth, which adhere to it by the roots, by it they are sustained,
and from it in a certain way they separate; for this reason I judge that in the
narrative the ordinary course of nature is observed, because on the same day
that the earth appeared these things were created, and yet God said again that
the earth should germinate: and it was also repeated, and so it was done; and
then, according to the rule that we previously expounded, then it was said: and
so it was done, the same execution was added, saying: and the earth produced
grass of food, which bears seed according to its kind, and fruit tree that
begets fruit, and his seed in him is according to his likeness. And again he
says: and God saw that it was good. Thus, in one and the same day these things
come together and are separated from each other by the repeated words of God.
This I believe was not done when dealing with the land and the sea, because in
a special way the nature of these things that are born and die and were
propagated by the succession of seed must be discerned. Or will it be because
the earth and the sea could have been made at the same time, not only in the
reason of the spiritual creature, where all things were made at the same time,
but also in their own bodily nature, but the trees and all class of terrestrial
roots, they could not have been born without preceeding the earth, in which
they would germinate; and, therefore, God's command was to be repeated so that
created things could point to intervals of time, not to be done on another day,
since the plants take root in the earth through the roots and thus continue to
adhere to her all her life? But it can also be asked: why did God not name the
plants? Did he overlook it because so many of them did not allow it? We will
study this question better later when we consider other works to which God did

luminaries be made in the firmament of heaven so that they may shine on the
earth and divide the day and the night, and be in signs and times, and in days
and years and shine in the firmament of heaven and shine on the earth On the
fourth day the luminaries were made, of which it is said to be in days. What do
you want to indicate these past three days without luminaries, or why these
stars were placed to mark the days, if the days could also exist without them?
Was it perhaps because the movement of these luminaries can be distinguished
more clearly that prolongation of time and intervals of duration? Or is it that
this enumeration of days and nights lends itself better to distinguish between
that nature that has not been made and those that were, in such a way as to be
called tomorrow by the form of things formed and later by the privation of such
shape? Because if we look at God by whom they are made, they are beautiful and
hernious; but if we look at what they are, they can be diminished, because they
were made out of nothing; if they do not annihilate, they do not owe it to
their matter, which comes from nothing, but to the supreme Being that keeps
them in their gender and order.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

luminaries be made in the firmament of heaven so that they may shine. Was this
said about the stars that are fixed or also those that move? The two luminaries,
the largest and the smallest, are counted among the stars that wander. How,
then, were all the stars created in the firmament of heaven, when in particular
each one of these that move has its own zone or circle? Or was it said because
we read in the divine Scripture that there are many heavens and a sky, and
therefore in this place, when the firmament is called heaven, it is to be
understood that it speaks of all this ethereal realm that contains all the
stars, below which reigns the serenity of pure and tranquil air, as under such
serenity Is this turbulent and stormy air stirred? So that they shine on the
earth and divide day and night. Had not God already divided the light and the
darkness, and had called the light day and the darkness night, where it appears
to have already divided the day and the night before? What do you want, then,
to tell us now with what is said of the luminaries, and divide the day and the
night? Is this division now made by luminaries so that it is known by men who
use only their fleshly eyes to contemplate these things? Thus, God would have
made this division before moving the stars in their orbits, so that it could
not be understood except by very few, by those who were endowed with healthy
spirit and clear reason. Or perhaps God made another division between another
kind of day and another kind of night, that is, between the form that imprinted
that universal reportable mass, and the information that still remained to be
formed? Different this day and different tonight, whose alternative is noticed
moving the sky, and that can not occur if it is not with the sunrise and
sunset.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

times, and in days and years. It seems to me that what he said are in signs,
they fully clarify the following words, and in time, so that thus one thing
would not be taken by sign and another by time; because these times of which he
now speaks and which are distinguished by their intervals, point out that on
them there is immutable eternity, so that they are a sign of it, that is, time
appears as a vestige of eternity. Also when he adds and in days and years he
declares that he deals with the times when the days are completed by the return
of the fixed stars; and the years are evident when the sun crosses the sidereal
circle, because the years are less evident, if we count them when each of the
planets crosses its orbit. He did not say "and be a sign of months",
because perhaps the month is the year of the moon; just as the twelve moons of
the year are the year of the star that the Greeks call gaezonta, the same as
thirty solar years make up the year of the star called fainon; and perhaps this
way also when the stars had returned to occupy the same position, the great
year is completed of which not a few said many things. Or perhaps he said in
signs, to show by them the true way to navigators; and in times, as to indicate
the time of spring, summer, autumn and winter, since these seasons also vary
and keep their place and order with the circular movement of the stars? They
serve as a signal in days and years, we must understand it as it is already

the luminaries in the firmament of heaven to illuminate the earth. Why do we
believe that this was repeated? Is it the same that was said about the plants,
that they carry seeds and that they are seeds according to their gender and
similarity? And, therefore, here too, but in a different way, was it said of
the luminaries, do and be, that is to say, do yourselves and not beget but be

luminaries, the luminary greater beginning of the day, and the lesser luminary
beginning of the night, and the stars. What the beginning of the day and night
means, we will see immediately. What was added and the stars is ambiguous
whether they belong or not at the beginning of the night. Some say that here it
is implied that the full moon was first made because she gets up at the
beginning of the night, that is, immediately after the sun sets. But it is
absurd to start counting from the sixteenth and fifteenth fair of the moon, not
from the first. And no one should say that the moon must have been perfect, for
it is perfect, that is, full every day, but its perfection is only seen by men
when it is opposite to the sun on the other side; when it is placed next to it,
as it is under it, it seems that it is without light; but then it is also full
because it is illuminated by the other part, although it can not be seen by
those who are under it, that is, by those who inhabit the earth; this can not
be demonstrated with few reasons, but with clever speeches and with the help of
certain visible drawings.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

two luminaries in the firmament of heaven so that they would shine on the
earth. How is it that it was previously said to be done in the firmament, and
why now it says, did God the luminaries and placed them in the firmament, as if
they had first been made out of it, and then they were placed in it, so that
Had he already told them to do it there? Was it meant to mean once and for all
that God does not work as men usually do, but that men were narrated as much as
possible? For men it is one thing to do and another to place, but for God both
things are the same, for acting puts and places work.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

and night and divide day and night. What he now expounds saying "preside
over the day and the night" was already said by saying that they were the
beginning of the day and the night. Then that principle must be understood by
presidency, because in the day there is nothing, among the things we see, more
excellent than the sun, and in the night nothing more than the moon and the
stars. Then we are not disturbed by that ambiguity anymore, and we believe that
the stars were placed so that they also belong to the initiation of the night,
that is, they have the presidency of it. And God saw that it was good. The same
order is observed as before. Let us also remember that God did not name these
things, so that it could be said: and God called the luminous stars, because

distinguished by the birth and sunset, this day is not the fourth, but perhaps
the first, since we judge that at that time the sun was born when it was made,
and that it was hidden while the other stars They were created. But whoever

out of the water reptiles of alive and volatile souls that fly on the earth
under the firmament of the sky, and thus it was done. Those animals that swim
are called reptiles because they do not walk with feet. Or were they called so
because there are others who crawl under water on the earth? Or maybe because
there are winged ones in the waters like fish, that have scales and others that
do not read them, but are adorned with wings? It can be doubted if in this
place they should be counted among the birds. There is a small problem here:
why do you attribute to the waters, and not to the air, the animals that are
perfect volatile? We can not understand that here we are dealing only with
waterfowl, such as the sea crow, the duck and others, because if I had only talked
about these, I would not have stopped talking about the other birds, among
which very many are so far away from the water that they do not even drink;
perhaps it called water to this air contiguous to the earth, since it testifies
to be humid, by the dew that in the calm nights falls in the earth and because
it also turns into clouds; and the clouds are water, as all those who walk on
the mountains among the clouds, or through the flat field in the fog.
Certainly, in this air it is said that birds fly; in that other higher and
purer, which without a doubt is called air, can not fly, since it is so subtle
that it does not bear the weight of them. In it the clouds can not condense,
nor the tempest be unleashed; because the wind is totally absent, as seen on
the top of Mount Olympus, which they say exceeds in height this humid air. As
those who, by custom, climbed the aforementioned mountain on the solemnities of
their sacrifices, it happened to write certain letters in the dust and after a
year they found them intact and intact.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">45. For this reason, with
just reason, it can be believed that in the divine Scriptures the space that is
up to this point is called the firmament of heaven, and that the most tranquil
and serene air belongs to the firmament. Under this name of firmament such
serenity and a great part of things can be understood. For which reason I also
judge that the following is said in many places of the psalms: and your truth
even to the clouds, 16 because nothing is more firm and serene than the truth;
but the clouds form below this very tranquil region of the air. Although what
has been said is figuratively taken, however, these things have been written as
having a certain resemblance to what they represent; in such a way that there
seems in reality to exist a certain image of the truth in this most unalterable
and pure bodily creature, which extends from the highest part of the sky to the
clouds, that is, to the caliginous, stormy and humid air; then rightly they are
attributed to the waters, the birds, that fly over the earth under the
firmament of the sky, because water is rightly called this air. By this it is
to be understood that nothing was spoken of the air; that is, what mode or when
it was made, because this low air bears the name of water, and that high, the
firmament. And so, no element was overlooked.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">46. ​​But perhaps one
will say: if by what was said congréguese the water we understand that the
water was made of that matter report, and that this congregation God called
sea, how do we understand that this air was made there, Well, it's not called
the sea, although it can be called water? It seems to me that when arid
appears, not only is the formation of the earth insinuated, but also that of
this dense air, because through this air the earth is illuminated to make
itself visible to us; then in the same and only word that was said to appear
are included all the operations, without which the earth could not be
manifested, that is, its form, its liberation from water, and being aerated,
because through the air the light is transmitted to the earth from the top of
the world. Or perhaps, in what was written: congréguese water, rather
emphasizes the formation of air, because when it condenses this air seems to
form water. So, perhaps, to the condensation in a dense mass, so that the sea
would form from it, he called it a congregation of water, so that what is not
gathered, that is, that is not condensed and flows over the land, be the water
that can hold the birds, but with these two names, subtle water and dense air.
But if you ask why this air was made, it is not said there. Or is it perhaps
true that some say that the aqueous evaporation of the sea and the earth forms
these much denser auras, than the superior and pure air, and so conditions them
so that they can withstand the flight of the birds? Such auras are more subtle
than the waters with which we wash our bodies, so that in comparison to them,
we perceive them as dry and aerial. But as we had already talked about the land
and the sea, what need was there to mention its evaporations, that is, the
waters where the birds fly, once it has been understood that the pure and
tranquil air is assigned to the sky?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">47. Nor was it stated how
the rivers and springs were made. Those who with great diligence investigate
and discuss these things and say that with the superficial movement of air the
vapor of fresh water is invisibly extracted from the sea, and from these
evaporations, which we can not feel, the clouds form; moistened the earth with
the rains, the water seeps drop by drop gathering in the most hidden caverns;
and after the earth transpires as much water as it has gathered, it lets it
pass through different conduits, sprouting in small or large springs, apt to
form the rivers. From which fact they want to indicate the steam collected from
the boiling seawater in a serpentine, whose vapor constitutes fresh water for
those who drink it. It is evident to almost all men that, as the scarcity of
rain makes itself felt, the sources diminish their flow. Also the divine
history testifies: Elías requested the rain in time of dryness and while he
prayed he sent to his servant directed the sight towards the sea; and when from
that part there appeared a tiny little cloud, then he announced to the King,
who was uneasy, that the rain was imminent, with which, even when he was
marching from there to run, he got wet. David also says: O Lord, you who draw
water from the sea and pour it on the surface of the earth18. Therefore, having
been named the sea, there was no need to speak of the remaining waters, either
of those that produce the dew and lend by their subtlety to the birds their
breezes, or of the waters of the rivers and springs, if the first ones are
produced by evaporation and the last ones by reciprocal rains, to which it
first absorbs the earth and then makes them sprout.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

waters of living souls: Why was it added alive? Can there be souls who do not
live? Or is it that they wanted to highlight this more ostensible life, which
animals have that they feel, but which plants lack? And produce birds that fly
over the earth below the firmament of heaven. If the birds do not fly in that
pure air, where no cloud forms, it is evident that he belongs to the firmament,
because it was said that the birds will fly above the earth beneath the sky.
And so it was done, the same order is observed here as in the past works and,
therefore, it is added the same as in the others, except in that of light,
which was made the first of all.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

great fishes and all the souls of the creeping creatures, to whom he produced
the water according to their kind, and all volatile according to their kind.
Let us remember the time that, according to its genre, it speaks of the
creatures that substitute each other for the seminal propagation, as already
discussed when talking about herbs and trees. And all volatile wings, why did
you add wings? Can a volatile exist without them? Given that such a species may
exist, God really created it, although it is not known where it was made. No
being can fly without wings, because bats, locusts, flies and if there is any
other animal of this kind that lacks feathers, nevertheless it does not lack
wings. It was added wings so that we understood that birds were not only talked
about, since the fish also have wings and fly over the earth in the middle of
the water. For this reason birds were not said, but volatile in general, and
volatile of wings. And God saw that it was good. This is to be understood as
stated in the other places where the same was said.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">50. And God blessed them,
saying, Increase and multiply and fill the waters of the sea, and the volatiles
multiply, upon the earth. God wanted the blessing to have the force of
fecundity, which manifests itself in the succession of the offspring, so that
because of this blessing, since they were created weak and mortal, others being
born, they perpetuated their gender. But having as they do also the plants in
the birth resemblance with the expired animals, I ask: why did not these bless
them? Is it because they lack meaning which is closer to reason? Perhaps it is
not without reason that God uses the second person in the blessing, and he does
so to induce the generation of these animals, as if in a certain way they
understood by saying, "Grow and multiply and fill the waters of the
sea." However, he does not continue speaking until the end of the blessing
in the second person, but he continues saying: and the volatiles multiply on earth.
He did not say, then, multiply on earth. Perhaps for this very reason it is
evident that the faculty of sense in animals is not so close to reason that
they could perfectly understand the invitation to generate, as can be
understood by those who pass and use reason.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">51. And so it was done.
Here you must completely awaken from your ignorance any rude and understand
what days it is. For having given God to the animals determined gestation
times, those who keep within a certain order an admirable firmness so that during
predetermined number of days each, according to their gender, carry in their
womb what they have conceived or incubate the eggs positions, whose law imposed
on nature is preserved by the wisdom of God, which embraces all things firmly
from one end of the world to the other and orders them with gentleness19. I
ask: in what way in a single day could you conceive and conceive in the uterus,
incubate and nourish what was born and populate the waters and multiply on the
earth? Why was it added before the earth appeared and it was done, but it is
because without a doubt when it was said the afternoon indicates the matter
report, and when it says it was done the morning indicates the form that was
printed on the subject in the same God's work, because with the morning, when
the work is finished, the day ends. God did not say the afternoon or the
morning, because all this is a very brief account of things already done,
understood in the words afternoon and tomorrow, meaning the first word the
material report, and the second the form; of those that had already been said
that God had made them. Moreover, when we pay attention to something imperfect,
that is, when we go from shape to formless matter and from it to nothingness,
if we believe that the imperfect in this name is insinuated by night or by
night, I would not say that it was done, but only ordained by God, as it says
above: God divided light and darkness. Therefore, when the afternoon was said,
the word "report" was designated by the word "afternoon",
which, despite having been made out of nothing, nevertheless exists and is
capable of forms and beauty. It can also be taken under the name of darkness
absolute nothingness, which God does not do because nothing is, and which made
everything that He deigned to do Omnipotent for his ineffable goodness, because
out of nothing he did all things.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

made and the morning was made the fifth day. Now after he said, and this was
done, he did not add, as usual, the enumeration of the execution of the works,
as if they were again made, since he had already enumerated them before. Not
even for that blessing that he gave to generate the offspring was some other
new creature, fine that through it the already made were conserved by the
succession. And for this reason he did not say "and God saw that it was
good", because already the same The creature had been pleasing to him and,
therefore, only had to be preserved in the seeds. Nothing, then, was repeated,
unless what was said and so it was done. After this he immediately speaks of
the afternoon and the morning, in whose names we explain that the work executed
by God of the material matter and of the form given to it was signified. This
is what I understand, although perhaps something better and more excellent
discover the scholars.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

earth produce a living soul, according to its kind, of four-footed animals, and
of snakes, and of beasts of the earth after their kind, and so it was done. In
the way above, we must consider and understand why it was added alive, having
said soul; and what it means according to its gender; and how is understood the
customary conclusion by which it is said, and thus it was done. Although the
Latin language under the name of beast generally includes all irrational
animals, here, however, species must be distinguished so that we understand all
the animals of charge by quadrupeds, by snakes all the living creatures that
crawl, by beasts or wild beasts all the unruly quadrupeds and animals all

For what did he say now we do, but who was said in the other formations? All
things were made for Him and without Him nothing was done20. But why do we
judge it to have been said in a different way, and do another, but it is
because there He did it at the Father's command and now together they did it?
Or perhaps it was spoken in this way because all the things that the Father
does are done through the Son and, consequently, it was said here that we do it
so that he himself, for whom the divine books were written, would see in this
way himself that all those things that the Son does speaking the Father, also
the Father makes them, so that what was said in the other creatures separately
(indicating the Father), and was made (pointing to the Son), here is He states
that the narration of the work and its work were not made separately, but that
both took place at the same time when it was said here: Let us do.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">57. And God said: Let us
make man in our image and likeness. Every image is similar to that of who is
image, but, nevertheless, not everything that is similar to something, is also
an image of it. This is seen in the mirror and in the painting; the represented
in them are images, and therefore, similar; but if one of the other is not
born, neither can be said to be the image of the other; there is, then, an
image when there is expression of something. Why, then, when it was said to the
image was it added and likeness, as if there could be an unlike image? Suffice
it to say "to image." Or is it that one thing is similar and another
similarity, as one thing is chaste and another is chastity, one strong and the
other different strength, so that all who are strong are strong and all who are
chaste Are they because of chastity, and so all who are similar are by
similarity? In the same way that where chastity is, by it all chaste things are
chaste, where similarity is, by it all things that are similar are similar; for
that reason it is not said with all property that our image is our similarity;
nevertheless, it is said with complete accuracy that he is similar to us.
Chastity, then, is chaste without the participation of anyone, but by the
participation of it are chaste things that are chaste; the same happens with
God, in whom is the same Wisdom, which, without the participation of anything
or anyone, is Wise, but with whose participation every soul is wise. Wherefore
also the likeness of God (the Son) by whom all things were made, is properly
called likeness, because it is similar not by participation of some other
likeness, but rather it is the first likeness, by whose participation they are
alike. all the things that God did for her.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">58. Then perhaps the
exposition will be that the addition, likeness, after saying the image, was
added to show that the one that was called image is not similar to God, as if
it participated in some other similarity, but that she herself is the
similarity, of which all the things that are said to be similar participate; as
she herself is chastity, for whose participation the souls are chaste; and
wisdom, by whose participation the souls are wise; and beauty, by whose
participation all things that are beautiful are beautiful. If, then, he only
named the similarity it would not indicate that it was by Him begotten; and if
he only made mention of the image, he would certainly make known that by him he
was begotten, but he would not manifest that in such a way he was similar, that
not only was he, but that he was the same likeness. Just as there is nothing
more chaste than chastity itself, and nothing is more wise than wisdom itself,
and nothing more beautiful than beauty itself, so nothing can be said or
thought or exist more similar than the same resemblance; whereby it is
understood that in such a way is similarity to the Father his Semejanza, that
fills his nature fully and perfectly.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">59. If we consider that
all nature, whether it is perceived by the senses or by reason, retains the
seal of the unit due to the similarity between the parties, we are allowed to
ponder in some way, although it transcends in eminent way human thoughts, to
what extent the likeness of God, by which all things were made, has virtue, to
imprint the form of creatures. Certainly by the Wisdom of God rational souls
are called wise, and this name does not extend beyond beings endowed with
reason, because to no animal, much less to trees, or fire, or air, or water, or
to the earth, we can call them wise, although as soon as they are, all these
things exist by the Wisdom of God. But, nevertheless, we say that the stones
are similar to each other the same as the animals, and also the men, and the
angels. Well, of each of the things, because they have their parts similar to
each other, we say that they have determined their being, and this makes the
earth is land and the water is water and would stop being water if any of its
parts is not similar to the other parts of it; likewise any part of the air, if
it were unlike the rest, could in no way be air; in the same way the particle
of fire and light, because it is not unlike the other parts, reaches to be what
it is. The same can be seen and understood in each of the stones, or in any of
the trees, or in all the animated bodies; for in no way would they exist with
the other beings of their kind, nor each of them in itself, if they did not
have similar parts to each other. A body is more beautiful, the more similar
the parts are to each other. Finally, not only the friendship of some souls
with others is based on similar customs, but also in each soul the happy life
indicates the similar actions and virtues, without which the permanence can not
exist. Of all these things we can say that they are similar, but not that they
are the same similarity. Therefore, although the universe is made up of things
similar to each other, so that each one by this similarity is itself what it
is, and together they constitute the universe, which God created and governs,
however, by the most excellent similarity immutable and uncontaminable of Him,
who created all things, were made such, that they are beautiful by like parts
of each other. But not all have been made in the likeness of Her, but only the
rational substance; therefore, all things by It were made, but in His likeness
only the soul.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">60. Thus, the rational
substance was made without interposition of any nature by the same Likeness of
God and like Her; since the human mind to any thing unites if it is not to the
Truth itself, which is called Image and Likeness and Wisdom of the Father,
which does not perceive it if it is not pure and blissful; then with all
rectitude, according to what man has of principal and internal, that is to say,
according to the mind, it is taken to make man in our image and likeness, since
precisely the whole man must be appreciated for that which exists in man as
principal, what separates him from the beasts. The other things that are in
man, although they are beautiful in their kind, are common to him with the
beasts and that is why in man they should be esteemed little, unless the
upright figure of the human body, raised to look at the sky, have also some courage
to believe that the same body was made in the likeness of God, so that as the
likeness does not depart from the Father, so the body of man is not in
opposition to heaven, as are the bodies of the other animals, since inclined to
the earth lie on the belly. This property and likeness should not be taken in a
rigorous sense, because our body is very different from heaven; but in that
Resemblance, which is the Son, nothing can have unlike Him to Whom it is
similar. All things that are similar, also by some part are unlike each other,
but the same resemblance is by no means unlike itself. The Father, then, is
Father, and the Son is nothing other than Son, but when it is said to be the
Likeness of the Father, even though it is revealed that there is no dissimilarity
between the two, nevertheless, it is not only the Father who is It has
similarity.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">61. And God said: Let us
make man in our image and likeness. With the above, we have more brings enough;
and according to this, these words of the divine Scripture, in which we read to
have said God we wounded the man in our image and likeness, express that we can
understand that the likeness of God according to which man was made is the same
Word of God, that is, e! Unigénito Son; but not that man is the same image and
likeness to the Father. E «, then, the man image of God as the Apostle clearly
demonstrates saying: man should not cover his head being as it is the image and
glory of God21. But this image, made in the image of God, is not equal and
coeternal to the one of whom it is an image, nor would it become so, although
it never would have sinned. The sense that we should rather choose in these
words, let us make man in our image and likeness, is that we do not understand
them as spoken in the singular, but in the plural, because man was not made in
the image of only the Father or of only the Son or only of the Holy Spirit, but
in the image of this Trinity; whose Trinity is thus Trinity that is one God,
and in such a way is one God who is Trinity. Therefore, the Father does not say
by the Son, let us make man in your image or in my image, but plurally he says
in our image and likeness; and who will dare to separate the Holy Spirit from
this plurality? This plurality is not three gods, but only one God; that is why
it is to be understood that later the Scripture introduced the singular saying:
And God made man in the image of God, so that it would not be taken as if God
the Father made man in the image of God, that is, of his Son, otherwise, how
true is what was said, in our image, if man was made only in the image of the
Son? Because what God said is true, in our image, that is why it was said thus:
God made man in the image of God, as if saying in his image that it is the same
Trinity.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">62. Many believe that the
similar word is not repeated here, that is, God was not said and made man in
the image and "likeness" of God, because at that time he was only
made in the image; but the likeness of Him was reserved for after the
resurrection of the dead; they say as if there could be an image in which there
is no resemblance, if it is not completely similar, no doubt there is no image
either. However, in order that it does not seem that we treat this matter
solely according to the reason, we will adduce the authority of the apostle
James, who, speaking of the language of man, says: with it we will bless God
and with it we will curse men, those who they were made to "likeness"
of God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

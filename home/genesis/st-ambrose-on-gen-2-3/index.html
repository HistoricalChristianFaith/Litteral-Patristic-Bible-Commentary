<div>ON APPROACHING THIS SUBJECT I seem to be possessed by an unusual eagerness in my quest to clarify the facts about <span>Paradise</span>, its place, and its nature to those who are desirous of this knowledge. This is all the more remarkable since the Apostle did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body, yet he says that he <i>'was caught up to the third heaven.' </i>[ 2 Cor. 12:2 ] And again he says: <i>'I know such a man-whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows-that he was caught up into <span>paradise</span> and heard secret words that man may not repeat. Of such a man I will boast; but of myself I will glory in nothing save in my infirmities. For if I do wish to boast, I shall not be foolish; for I am speaking the truth.' </i>[ 2 Cor. 12:3-6 ] If <span>Paradise</span>, then, is of such a nature that Paul alone, or one like Paul, could scarcely see it while alive, and still was unable to remember whether he saw it in the body or out of the body, and, moreover, heard words that he was forbidden to reveal--if this be true, how will it be 
<hr />
<tt>Page 288</tt><br /><br />possible for us to declare the position of <span>Paradise</span> which we have not been able to see and, even if we had succeeded in seeing it, we would be forbidden to share this information with others? And, again, since Paul shrank from exalting himself by reason of the sublimity of the revelation, how much more ought we to strive not to be too anxious to disclose that which leads to danger by its very revelation! The subject of <span>Paradise</span> should not, therefore, be treated lightly. With these words let us set aside the question of what was hidden to Paul. 
<p><a name="div12"></a><a name="glossGen2:8"></a>Nevertheless, we can find out who was the Creator of this <span>Paradise</span>. We read in Genesis that <i>'God planted a <span>garden</span> to the east and he put there the man he had formed.' </i>[ Gen 2:8 ] Who had the power to create <span>Paradise</span>, if not almighty God, who <i>'spoke and they were made' </i>[ Ps 32:9 ] and who was never in want of the thing which He wished to bring into being? He planted, therefore, that <span>Paradise</span> of which He says in His <span>wisdom</span>: <i>'Every plant which my Father has not planted will be rooted up.' </i>[ Matt.15:13 ] This is a goodly plantation for angels and saints. The saints are said to lie beneath the <span>fig tree</span> and the vine. [ Mich 6:6 ] In this respect they are the type of the angels [ Mark 12:25 ] in that time of peace which is to come. 
<p><a name="div13"></a>Hence, <span>Paradise</span> has many trees that are fruit.bearing, with plenty of sap, and vigor. Of these it is said: <i>'All the trees of the woods shall rejoice.' </i>[ Ps 95:12 ] The woods flourish ever with the green shoots of merit, just like that <i>'tree which is planted near the running waters, whose leaf shall not fall off,' </i>[ Ps 1:3 ] because its fruit is plenteous. Here, then, is <span>Paradise</span>. 
<p>
<hr />
<tt>Page 289</tt><br /><br /><a name="div14"></a>The place where it is planted is called delight; wherefore holy David says: <i>'Thou shalt not make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure,' </i>[ Ps 35:9 ] for you have read that <i>'a river rose in Eden watering the <span>garden</span>.' </i>[ Gen 2:10 ] These woods, therefore, which were planted in <span>Paradise</span> are watered by the outpouring of the waters of that spirit concerning which He says elsewhere: <i>'The stream of the river maketh the city of God joyful.' </i>[ Ps 45:5 ] Here is that city of Jerusalem which above is free, [ Gal 4:26 ] in which the different merits of the saints come to fruition. 
<p><a name="div15"></a>In this <span>garden</span>, therefore, God put the man He had formed. Take note that He placed man there not in respect to the image of God, but in respect to the body of man. The incorporeal does not exist in a place. He placed man in <span>Paradise</span>, just as He placed the sun in heaven, awaiting lordship over the heavens, just as the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God. [ Rom 8:9 ] 
<p><a name="div16"></a>Hence, if <span>Paradise</span> is a place where shrubs have opportunity to blossom, then <span>Paradise</span> has a certain vital force which receives and multiplies seeds in which each and every virtue is planted, and where flourishes the tree of life which is called <span>Wisdom</span>. Of this, Solomon says that <span>Wisdom</span> arose not of the earth but of the Father: <i>'For she is the brightness of eternal light' and 'the emanation of the glory of the almighty God.' </i>[ Wisd 7:25-26 ] 
<p>
<hr />
<tt>Page 290</tt><br /><br /><a name="div02"></a><a name="div17"></a><a name="glossGen2:9"></a>There was a tree of the knowledge of good and evil in <span>Paradise</span>. This was so because <i>'God made to grow a tree pleasant to sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the <span>garden</span> and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.' </i>[ Gen 2:9 ] We shall see later whether this tree, like the others, was pleasant to sight and good for food. The question will be more fittingly discussed at the point where, on tasting the fruit of this tree, we find that man was deceived. Meantime, we should no[t] reproach ourselves for not being able to know precisely the reasons behind these facts. We should not form a hasty judgment in respect to this product of creation, if it presents to our intellect what seems to us--like the creation of serpents and certain poisonous creatures-difficult and incomprehensible. In fact, we are unable, owing to human weakness, yet to know and understand the reason for the creation of each and every object. Let us, therefore, not criticise in holy Scripture something which we cannot comprehend. There are very many things which must not be subjected to the judgment of our intellect. Rather, these should be surveyed from the lofty heights of Divine Providence and from the intentions of God Himself. 
<p><a name="div18"></a>Without prejudice, then, to what we shall say hereafter, set it down as a first principle that the subject of this tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to you a displeasing one. After men had tasted of this tree, they realized that they were naked. [ Gen 3:7 ] Nevertheless, I will state for your benefit that as a consummation of God's creation this tree grew in <span>Paradise</span> and that it was permitted by God, in order that we might be able to know the preeminence of good. How could we learn to know that there was a difference between good and evil, if there existed no 
<hr />
<tt>Page 291</tt><br /><br />knowledge of good and evil? We could not have come to realize that evil was evil, unless there was knowledge of good, and that there could not be knowledge of good, unless there was actual good. Again, we could not have know[n] what in itself was good, unless there was knowledge of evil. Take an example from the nature of the human body. There exists as a matter of fact a certain bitter and poisonous substance which has been discovered to have a general salutary effect on the health of men. Hence, what we regard as evil frequently turns out to be not in every respect evil, but to be advantageous for general use. Just as poison exists in a part of the body but has a beneficial effect on the body as a whole, so God established the knowledge in part of what is good and evil, in order that the whole might be benefitted. 
<p><a name="div19"></a>Hence it follows that the serpent in <span>Paradise</span> was certainly not brought into being without the will of God. In the figure of the serpent we see the Devil. That the Devil existed even in <span>Paradise</span> we are informed by the Prophet Ezekiel, who in discussing the Prince of Tyre says: <i>'Thou wast in the pleasures of the <span>paradise</span> of God.' </i>[ Ezek 28:13 ] We maintain that the Prince of Tyre stands for the Devil. Shall we, therefore, accuse God because we cannot comprehend the treasures-with the exception of those which He has deigned to reveal-of His majesty and <span>wisdom</span> which lie hidden and concealed in Christ? Yet He did reveal to us the fact that the wickedness of the Devil is fruitful for man's salvation. This would not be the Devil's intention, but the Lord makes the wickedness of him who stands in opposition to us contribute something to our salvation. The wickedness of the Devil has caused the virtue and patience of one holy man to shine in a clearer light. The justice of Job was so disciplined and 
<hr />
<tt>Page 292</tt><br /><br />exercised by the wickedness of his opponent that eventually he gained the crown of victory over his adversary, the Devil. No one is crowned <i>'unless he has competed according to the rules.' </i>[ 2 Tim 2:5 ] Joseph's chastity, too, would never have been recorded for us, if it did not happen that a woman, the wife of his master and friend, incited and goaded by the Devil's allurements, had not played with his affections. [ Gen 39:17 ] This woman finally endeavored to bring about his death. This event added more to the fame of a man who by his continence faced death in defense of chastity. Do you desire to know God's plan? Here is an instance. Through the instrumentality of the Devil there was once an occasion when a just man prepared to perpetrate manslaughter. The situation was one that involved the murder of one's own son. Yet, for all that, the Lord tempted Abraham in this wise. He demanded that Abraham sacrifice his son to Him. By reason of this temptation he was able to prove himself faithful to the Lord, since compliance to his vow and not pity for his beloved son brought about repeal of the order. [ Gen 22:1 ] There was, therefore, in <span>Paradise</span> a tree of knowledge of good and evil which appeared to the eye to be beautiful and to the taste to be edible. It was not actually good to eat, for its fruit appeared to have a harmful effect on man. What is injurious to individuals may nevertheless have a beneficial effect on men as a whole. The Devil, for example, did harm to Judas, [ Luke 22:3 ] but he bestowed the wreath of victory on all the other Apostles, inasmuch as they were able to face and overcome the force of his temptation. 
<p><a name="div110"></a>Accordingly, let it not be a subject of reprehension or doubt that the Devil existed in <span>Paradise</span>. As a matter of fact 
<hr />
<tt>Page 293</tt><br /><br />he was powerless to bar from the saints the way of their ascent. As one who had the right of possession, he did not evict the just from their habitation. It may be that he turned away from the occupancy of that high estate some who were in fact slothful and vicious. There is a recorded event that arouses to a much greater degree our regard and our admiration. This is the fact that the Devil was excluded from the prayers of the saints as the result of an event which was to take place: <i>'I was watching Satan fall as lightning from heaven.' </i>[ Luke 10:18 ] Let us, therefore, not fear one who is so weak that he is destined to fall from heaven. He actually received the power to tempt us but not the competency to subvert us, except when our weak and unassisted will falters because it is powerless to summon aid. For that reason we need to know what was the nature of the deceit inflicted on the first man. We ought to know, too, the method and manner of the Devil's procedure and what in man he thought was subject to temptation, so that we, in knowing this, may proceed to take precautions. 
<p><a name="div111"></a>Many people nevertheless are of the opinion that the Devil was not in <span>Paradise</span>, although we read that he stood with the angels in heaven. [ Zech. 3:1 ] These persons interpret the statement of Scripture according to their own fancy. In this way they put aside any objection which they may have to the words of Scripture. We stand by the conviction held by one who preceded us that sin was committed by man because of the pleasure of sense. We maintain that the figure of the serpent stands for enjoyment and the figure of the woman for the emotions of the mind and heart. The latter is called by the Greeks <i>aisthesis </i>. When according to this theory, the senses are <i>aisthesis </i>deceived, the mind, which the Greeks call <i>nous </i>, falls into error. Hence, not without reason the 
<hr />
<tt>Page 294</tt><br /><br />author to whom I refer [Cf. Philo, De opificio mundi 59; Legum allegoriae I 29.] accepts the Greek word <i>nous </i>as a figure of a man and <i>aisthesis </i>as that of a woman. Hence, some have interpreted Adam to mean an earthly <i>nous </i>. In the Gospel the Lord sets forth the parable of the virgins who awaited the coming of the bridegroom with either lighted or extinguished lamps. Thus He exemplifies either the pure emotions of the wise or the impure senses of the unwise. [ Matt 25:1 ] If Eve, that is, the emotions of the first woman, had kept her lamp lighted, she would not have enfolded us in the meshes of her sin. She would not have fallen from the height of immortality which is established as the reward of virtue. 
<p><a name="div03"></a><a name="div1"></a><a name="glossGen2:10,Gen2:11,Gen2:12,Gen2:13"></a><span>Paradise</span> is, therefore, a land of fertility-that is to say, a soul which is fertile-planted in Eden, that is, in a certain delightful or well-tilled land in which the soul finds pleasure. Adam exists there as <i>nous </i>[mind] and Eve as 'sense.' Take note of what this soul of ours has in the nature of defense against natural and weak tendencies or against situations which might be unfavorable to us in our attempts to avoid danger. 
<p><a name="div113"></a>There was a fount which irrigated the land of <span>Paradise</span>. [ Gen 2:10 ] Is not this stream our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fount as well as the Father of eternal life? It is written: <i>'For with thee is the fountain of life.' </i>[ Ps 35:10 ] Hence: <i>'From within him there shall flow living waters.' </i>[ John 7:38; cf. Isa 58:11 ] We read of a fountain and a river which irrigates in <span>Paradise</span> the fruit-bearing tree that bears fruit for 
<hr />
<tt>Page 295</tt><br /><br />life eternal. You have read, then, that a fount was there and that <i>'a river rose in Eden,' </i>[ Gen 2:10 ] ,/cite that is, in your soul there exists a fount. This is the meaning of Solomon's words: <i>'Drink water out of thy own cistern and the streams of thy own well.' </i>[ Prov 5:15 ] This refers to the fount which rose out of that well-tilled soul, full of pleasant things, this fount which irrigates <span>Paradise</span>, that is to say, the soul's virtues that blossom because of their eminent merits. 
<p><a name="div114"></a><i>'The river,' we are told, 'is separated into four branches. The name of one is Phison which encircles all the land of Hevila, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good, bdellium and onyx there. The name of the second river is Gihon. This river encircles all the land of Ethiopia. The name of the third river is Tigris, which river flows by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.' </i>[ Gen 2:10.14 ] There are, therefore, four rivers. Phison-.so called by the Hebrews, but named Ganges by the Greeks-flows in the direction of India. Gihon is the river Nile, which flows around the land of Egypt or Ethiopia. The land enclosed by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is called Mesopotamia because it lives between these two rivers. This name conveys its location even to far-distant peoples and, besides, expresses popular belief. But how is the fount called the <span>Wisdom</span> of God? That this is a fount the Gospel tells us in the words, <i>'If anyone thirst, let him come to me and drink.' </i>[ John 7:37 ] <span>Wisdom</span> is a fount according to the Prophet: <i>'Come and eat my bread and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.' </i>[ Prov 9:15 ] As <span>Wisdom</span> is the fountain of life, it is also the fountain of spiritual grace. It is also the fountain of other virtues which guide us to the course of eternal 
<hr />
<tt>Page 296</tt><br /><br />life. Therefore, the stream that irrigates <span>Paradise</span> rises from the soul when well-tilled, not from the soul which lies uncultivated. The results therefrom are fruit trees of diverse virtues. There are four principal trees which constitute the divisions of <span>Wisdom</span>. These are the well-known four principal virtues: prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice. The wise men of this world have adopted this division from us and transferred it to their writings. Hence, <span>Wisdom</span> acts as the source from which these four rivers take their rise, producing streams that are composed of these virtues. 
<p><a name="div115"></a>Phison, therefore, stands for prudence. Hence it has pure gold, brilliant rubies, and topaz stones. We often refer to wise discoveries as gold, as the Lord says, speaking through the Prophet: <i>'I gave to them gold and silver.' </i>[ Hosea 2:8 ] Daniel says of the wise: <i>'If you sleep among the midst of the lots, you shall be as the wings of the dove covered with silver and the hinder parts of her back like to gold.' </i>[ Ps 67:14 ] In this way one who puts his trust in the aid of the Old and New Testament can by resourceful inquiry attain the inmost secrets of the <span>Wisdom</span> of God. Here, therefore, is found pure gold, not the metal which is melted, which belongs to this earth, and is subject to corruption. In this land, we are told, there is found the brilliant ruby stone in which there exists the vita spark of our souls. Here, too, is the topaz stone which by the nature of its color reveals an effect of greenness and vitality. Plants which are alive give forth green sprouts, while those that are dead are sapless and dry. The earth grows green when it is in bloom. The seeds, too, sprout forth green shoots in their periods of growth. The river Phison is rightfully given first place. The Hebrews call it Pheoyson, which means 'change of mouth,' because it flows even through Lydia and not merely around one nation, for <span>Wisdom</span>, which is of benefit 
<hr />
<tt>Page 297</tt><br /><br />to all men, is productive and useful. Hence, if a person were to leave <span>Paradise</span>, this river of <span>Wisdom</span> would be the first object he would meet. Thus he may not become inert and arid and his return to <span>Paradise</span> may be facilitated. Many men resort to this river, which is considered to have marvelous beauty and fecundity. Accordingly, it is regarded as a figure of <span>Wisdom</span>, which confers manifold fruits in the coming of the Lord of Salvation. It flows, too, to the very ends of the earth, because, by <span>Wisdom</span> all men have been redeemed. Wherefore it is written: <i>'Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth and their words unto the end of the world.' </i>[ Ps 18:5 ] 
<p><a name="div116"></a>The second river is Gihon, by which, when they were sojourning in Egypt, was laid down the law of the Israelites that they should depart from Egypt, [ Exod 12:11 ] and having girded their loins they should as a sign of temperance partake of a lamb. It is fitting that the chaste and the sanctified should celebrate the Pasch of the Lord. For that reason, the observance of the Law was first carried out beside that river, the name of which signifies an opening of the earth. Therefore, just as an opening absorbs the earth and whatever defilements and refuse there may be in it, in like manner chastity tends to consume all the passions of the body. Appropriately, then, the observance of the established Law first took place there, because carnal sin is absorbed by the Law. And so Gihon, which is a figure of chastity, is said to surround the land of Ethiopia in order to wash away our lowly bodies and quench the fires of our vile flesh. The meaning of Ethiopia in Latin is 'holy and vile.' What is more lowly, what is more like Ethiopia, than our bodies, blackened, too, by the darkness of sin? 
<p><a name="div117"></a>The third river is the Tigris, which flows by the 
<hr />
<tt>Page 298</tt><br /><br />Assyrian land. To this river the deceiver Israel was dragged as a prisoner. This river is the swiftest of all rivers. The Assyrian dwell by it, guarding its course-.for this is the meaning of its name. Hence, those who by their fortitude hold in check the guileful vices of the body and direct themselves to higher things are thought to have something in common with this river. For that same reason fortitude emanates from that source in <span>Paradise</span>. Fortitude in its rapid course tosses aside everything standing in its path and like this river is not hindered by any material obstacle. 
<p><a name="div118"></a>The fourth river is the Euphrates, which means in Latin 'fecundity and abundance of fruits.' It presents a symbol of Justice, the nourishment of every soul. No virtue produces more abundant benefits than Equity or Justice, which is more concerned with others than with itself, neglecting its own advantages, and preferring the common good. Many derive Euphrates from the Greek <i>apo tou euphrainesthai </i>--that is, from a 'feeling of gladness,' because the human race rejoices in nothing more than it does in Justice and Equity. The question as to why, although the location itself of other rivers is reported, we have no description of the regions through which the river Euphrates flows calls for an answer. The waters of this river are considered to have a vital quality which fosters growth and increase. Wherefore, the wise men among the Hebrews and the Assyrians called this river Auxen [increase] in contradistinction to the water of other rivers. The opposition has been well established between <span>wisdom</span> and malice, fortitude and irascibility, temperance, and other vices. Justice, on the other hand, is the most important as it represents the concord of all the other virtues. Hence it is not known from the places from which it flows, that is to say, it is not known in part. Justice is not divisible into parts. It is, as it were, the mother of all virtues. In these four rivers are symbolized, 
<hr />
<tt>Page 299</tt><br /><br />therefore, the four principal virtues. It may well be said that these virtues have been the determining boundary lines for the four great ages of the world. This, in fact, is the topic of the discourse which follows. 
<p><a name="div119"></a>The first age, then, is the age of <span>Wisdom</span>. This period extends from the beginnings of the world up to the time of the Flood. The Lord has given us the names of the just men of this age. Abel was so called, and so was Enos, a man made to the image of God, who hoped to invoke the name of the Lord God. Henoch, also, whose name in Latin means 'grace of God,' was carried up to heaven, [ Gen 5:24 ] and Noe, who was a just man [ Gen 6:9 ] and one who might be called a guide to tranquillity.[Cf. Isidore, <i>Etym. </i>7.6:15] 
<p><a name="div120"></a>The second age of the world is that of Abraham and Isaac, Jacob, and a number of other patriarchs. This was a period in which religion flourished in its more temperate and purest form. Pure was Isaac, a son given to Abraham according to promise, not as an offering of the body, but as a gift of divine beneficence. In him there is found the figure of Him who is pure as the Apostle teaches. <i>'The promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring.' </i>[ Gal 3:16 ] He does not say, "And to his offsprings," but as of one, "And to thy offspring," who is Christ.'16 
<p><a name="div121"></a>The third age lies in the period of the Law of Moses and in the time of the other Apostles. 'For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, of Barac, of Samson, of David and of Samuel, Elias and Elisaeus, who by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle and captured the 
<hr />
<tt>Page 300</tt><br /><br />camps of aliens.' [ Heb 11:32-34 ] Not without reason, then, do these men stand as types of fortitude. Further on we are told: <i>'They were sawed asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword. They went about in goatskins, destitute, distressed, afflicted-of whom the world was not worthy-wandering in deserts, mountains, caves and holes in the earth.' </i>[ Heb 11:37,38 ] Appropriately, therefore, do we set these men down as types of Fortitude. 
<p><a name="div122"></a>The figure of Justice is, according to the Gospel, a meritorious one, because <i>'it is unto salvation to everyone who believes.' </i>[ Rom 1:16 ] Hence, the Lord Himself says: <i>'Permit us to fulfill all justice.' </i>[ Matt 3:15 ] She is truly the prolific parent of the other virtues. Yet, whoever possesses any of the above mentioned principal virtues has the other virtues, also, since these virtues are so connected as to form a unit. Surely, Abel, a just and courageous man, Abraham, a man of great patience, the Prophets, men of the greatest <span>wisdom</span>, and Moses, a man of great learning, considered that the ingloriousness of Christ brought far greater honor than the treasures of Egypt. Who was wiser than Daniel? Solomon, too, sought <span>wisdom</span> and merited it. [ 1 Kings 3:8 ] Enough has been said, therefore, on the subject of the four rivers of virtue whose waters are salutary. We have discussed, too, the reason why Phison is said to have not only the gold, but also the ruby and the topaz stone, of that goodly land. We propose now to develop the latter topic. 
<p><a name="div123"></a>Since Enos in his <span>wisdom</span> yearned to know the name of God, he seems to us to stand for gold that is good. [ Gen 4:26: 5:24 ] Henoch, who was borne aloft and did not see death, can be likened to a ruby 
<hr />
<tt>Page 301</tt><br /><br />stone of pleasant odor which holy Henoch by his works offered to God, thus exhaling in his active and exemplary life something akin to sweetness. Noe, on the other hand, like the green topaz stone, suggests a color which represents life, since he alone at the time of the Flood preserved in his ark the vital seed of the formation of the world to come. <span>Paradise</span>, a land watered by many rivers, is then appropriately situated in the East and not in the regions facing it. This reference to the East is significant, for the rising sun may be compared to Christ [ Matt 24:27 ] who flashed forth a gleam of eternal light which exists in Eden, that is, in a land of delight. 
<p><a name="div04"></a><a name="div124"></a><a name="glossGen2:15"></a><i>'And God took the man whom he has created and placed him in the <span>garden</span> of Eden to till it and keep it.' </i>[ Gen 2:15 ] Note, now, the person who was taken and the land where he was formed. The virtue of God, therefore, took man and breathed into him, so that man's virtue will advance and increase. God set him apart in <span>Paradise</span> that you may know that man was taken up, that is to say, was breathed upon by the power of God. Note the fact that man was created outside <span>Paradise</span>, whereas woman was made within it. This teaches us that each person acquires grace by reason of virtue, not because of locality or of race. Hence, although created outside <span>Paradise</span>, that is, in an inferior place, man is found to be superior, whereas woman, created in a better place, that is to say, in <span>Paradise</span>, is found to be inferior. She was first to be deceived and was responsible for deceiving the man. Wherefore the Apostle Paul has related that holy women have in olden times been 
<hr />
<tt>Page 302</tt><br /><br />subject to the stronger vessel and recommends them to obey their husbands as their masters. [ 1 Peter 3:1 ] And Paul says: <i>'Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and was in sin.' </i>[ 1 Tim 2:14 ] This is a warning that no one ought to rely on himself, for she who was made for assistance needs the protection of a man. [ Gen 2:18 ] The head of the woman is man, who, while he believed that he would have the assistance of his wife, fell because of her. [ 1 Cor 11:3 ] Wherefore, no one ought to entrust himself lightly to another unless he has first put that person's virtue to the test. Neither should he claim for himself in the role of protector one whom he believes is subservient to him. Rather, a person should share his grace with another. Especially is this true of one who is in the position of greater strength and one who plays the part of protector. We have advice of the Apostle Peter, wherein he recommends that husbands pay honor to their wives: <i>'Husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives considerately, paying honor to the woman as to the weaker vessel and as co.heir of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered.' </i>[ 1 Peter 3:7 ] 
<p><a name="div125"></a>Therefore man was placed in <span>Paradise</span>, while the woman was created in <span>Paradise</span>. The woman, even before she was deceived by the serpent, shared grace with a man, since she was taken from a man. Yet <i>'this is a great mystery,' </i>[ Eph. 5:32 ] as the Apostle said. Wherefore he traced the source of life from it. And so Scripture refers only to man in the words: <i>'He placed him in the <span>garden</span> of Eden to till it and keep it.' </i>[ Gen 2:15 ] The act of tilling and the act of keeping are one and the same thing. In tilling there is a certain exercise of man's virtue, while in keeping it is understood that 
<hr />
<tt>Page 303</tt><br /><br />the work is accomplished, for protection implies something completed. These two acts are required of man. In this way, it is generally assumed, man can seek after something new and may keep what he has acquired. Philo, on the other hand, limited in his interpretation of this Scriptural passage to its moral aspect, since, because of his Jewish tendencies, he did not understand its spiritual import. He maintained that the two aspects were those of tilling the fields and of protecting the home. Although, he said, <span>Paradise</span> did not require labor in the fields, the first man, even in <span>Paradise</span>, undertook a kind of toil so as to furnish a law for future ages by which to bind us to the performance and to the preservation of our bounden duty and to the function of supporting hereditary succession.[Cf. Philo, Quaestiones in Gen 1:14] Both these point of view, the moral and the spiritual, are exacted of you. The prophetic psalm instructs you regarding this: <i>'Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, they watch in vain that keepeth it.' </i>[ Ps 126:1 ] It is obvious that the laborers are those who engage in the actual operation of building, while the watchers are those to whom the duty of protecting the perfected work is entrusted. Hence the Lord said to the Apostles, as if they were on the point of perfecting their work: <i>'Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.' </i>[ Matt 26:41 ] By this He meant that the function of a nature that was perfected along with the grace of abundant virtue should be preserved and that no one, even one who has attained some perfection, ought to feel really secure of himself unless he remains vigilant. 
<hr />
<tt>Page 304</tt><br /><br />
<p><a name="div05"></a><a name="div126"></a><a name="glossGen2:16,Gen2:17"></a><i>'And the Lord God commanded the man thus: 'from every tree of the <span>garden</span> thou shalt eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, for the day you eat of it you shall die.' </i>[ Gen 2:16 ] Why did He use the singular 'thou shalt eat' when He bade them eat of every tree, and, again, when He bade them eat of the tree of good and evil, why did He use the plural 'You shall not eat'? This is no trifling question. This problem can, in fact, be solved by the authority of the Scriptures if you study them carefully. Scripture refers to something good and something that should be done. What is good is naturally associated with what should be done. On the other hand, what is base is separate and unrelated to what should be done. And so the Lord, aiming always at oneness, gave orders in accordance with this principle. Hence He achieves oneness who <i>'has made both one' </i>[ Eph 2:14 ] -.He not only made both one, for He bade us to be <i>'one body and one Spirit.' </i>[ Eph 4:4 ] <i>'The first.born of every creature,' </i>[ Col 1:15 ] since He is in union with the faith, is always closely joined to the Father, because <i>'the Word was with God.' </i>[ John 1:1 ] Wherefore He says: <i>'I and the Father are one,' </i>[ John 10:30 ] in order to show His union with the Father in majesty and in dignity. But He bade us to be one and transfused into us by the adoption of grace the likeness of His own nature and His own oneness, saying: <i>'Father, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them and thou in me.' </i>[ John 17:22 ] When He prescribes a good, therefore, He does it to one 
<hr />
<tt>Page 305</tt><br /><br />person, saying, <i>'Thou shalt eat,' </i>for the oneness cannot be gainsaid. Where, however, He says that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil should not be tasted, He speaks in effect to several people: <i>'You shall not eat.' </i>What has been prohibited has general application to several people. But I have another opinion on this matter. I am able to discover the meaning of what we are discussing in the very words of God Himself. Adam alone was bidden to taste of every tree and it was foreseen that he would follow that injunction. In the plural sense, and not in the singular, God sees that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil should not be tasted. He knew that the woman would sin. Thus, by using the plural, God points out that they will not follow the injunction, because, where there are many, there are differences of opinion. 
<p><a name="div127"></a>If we look into the sense of the words as expressed in the Septuagint [plural form, Vulgate has singular] the meaning is clear. Symmachus, however, takes both expressions in a singular sense. This is explained by the fact that in the Law, God, addressing His people, uses the singular: <i>'Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord' and 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.' </i>[ Deut 6:4,5 ] I am not influenced by the interpretation of Symmachus, who could not see the oneness of the Father and Son, although at times both he and Asylas admitted it in their discussions. The fact that God addresses in the singular number a people who will later contravene His commands should not lead us to think that I am dissenting from my former statement, inasmuch as the Jewish people, regarded as a single person, violated the injunctions imposed upon them. We have here a law of the Spirit whereby God addresses the people in divine language. 
<hr />
<tt>Page 306</tt><br /><br />In this case we should consider not so much the words as their prophetic import. Wherefore He says: <i>'Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam.' </i>[ Exod 34:26 ] 
<p><a name="div128"></a>From this point on, the celestial precepts present no great difficulty. However, there has been raised by several authors a question which we ought to answer lest simple minds be led astray by erroneous interpretation. Many authors, like Apelles in his thirty.eighth volume,[Apelles; cf. Harnack <i>TU </i>6.3:116]propose the following questions. How is it, for example, that the tree of life has more power for giving life than the breath of God? Again, if man is not made perfect by God and each person acquired by his own effort a more perfect state of virtue for himself, does it not seem that man would gain for himself more than God had bestowed on him? Then they make the objection that, if man had not tasted death, he certainly could not be aware of what he had not tasted. What man had not tasted was something unknown to him. Accordingly, he could not be afraid of that of which he had no knowledge. To no purpose, therefore, did God inflict death as a punishment on men for whom it holds no fear. 
<p><a name="div129"></a>We should be aware of the fact, therefore, that where God has planted a tree of life. He has also planted a tree of life in the midst of <span>Paradise</span>. It is understood that He planted it in the middle. Therefore, in the middle of <span>Paradise</span> there was both a tree of life and a cause for death. Keep in mind that man did not create life. By carrying out and observing the precepts of God it was possible for man to find life. This was the life mentioned by the Apostle: <i>'Your life is hidden with Christ in God.' </i>[ Col 3:3 ] Man, therefore was, figuratively speaking, either in the shadow of life--because our life on earth is but a shadow--or man 
<hr />
<tt>Page 307</tt><br /><br />had life, as it were, in pledge, for he had been breathed on by God. He had, therefore, a pledge of immortality, but while in the shadow of life he was unable, by the usual channels of sense, to see and attain the hidden life of Christ with God. Although not yet a sinner, he was not possessed of an incorrupt and inviolable nature. Of course, one who afterwards lapsed into sin was far from being as yet in the category of sinner. Hence, he was in the shadow of life, whereas sinners are in the shadow of death. According to Isaias, the people who sinned sat in the shadow of death. [ Isa 9:2 ] For these a light arose, not by the merits of their virtues, but by the grace of God. There is no distinction, therefore, between the breath of God and the food of the tree of life. No man can say that he can acquire more by his own efforts than what is granted him by the generosity of God. Would that we had been able to hold on to what we had received! Our toils avail only to the extent that we take back again what was once conferred on us. The third objection, that one who has not tasted death cannot fear it, finds its solution in our common experience. There is an instinct innate in all living creatures which impels them to dread even what they have not yet experienced as harmful. Why is it that doves, even at the moment of their birth, are terrorized at the sight of a hawk? Why are wolves dreaded by sheep and hawks by chickens? In irrational animals there is a certain innate fear of creatures of a different species to the extent that, even though these animals are irrational, they have a feeling that death is something to be shunned. Such being the case, how true is it that the first man, fully and indubitably endowed with reason, should be conscious of the fact that death is something to be avoided! 
<hr />

<p><a name="div06"></a><a name="div130"></a>There are some, again, who suggest for solution difficulties such as the following. For example, they maintain that refusal to obey an order is not always wrong. If the order is a good one, then the act of obeying is commendable. But if the order is a wicked one, it is not feasible to obey it. Therefore, it is not always wrong to disobey an order, but it is wrong to refuse to obey an order that is good. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is a creation that is good, since God had knowledge of good and evil. Hence He says: <i>'Indeed! The man has become like one of us.' </i>[ Gen 3:23 ] If, therefore, possessing the knowledge of good and evil is good and if what God has is a good, it would appear that the prohibition to prevent man from making use of it is not a righteous one. Such is their argument. But, if they were to realize the real significance and force of the word 'knowledge' as they should-. <i>'The Lord knew who belong to him,' </i>[ Num 16:5 ] that is, He knew those surely among whom He dwells and walks, who were made one out of so many-.then certainly these people would know that knowledge is not to be interpreted merely as superficial comprehension, but as the carrying out of what ought to be accomplished. Man ought to obey the command. A failure to obey is a violation of duty. The man, therefore, who disobeys falls into error because violation of duty is a sin. Even if these people should agree to a modified meaning of the word 'knowledge' and consider that an imperfect comprehension of good and evil was prohibited, in that respect, too, there is a violation of duty in not complying with the command. The Lord God has made it clear that even an imperfect comprehension of good and evil should be prohibited. 
<p>
<hr />
<tt>Page 309</tt><br /><br /><a name="div131"></a>Another problem: The man who does not know good and evil differs in no respect from a little child. A judge who is just does not consider a child to be guilty of crime. The just Creator of the world would never have found fault with a child for his lack of knowledge of good and evil, because a child cannot be charged with a violation of a law. In the preceding passage, however, we have said that, once you accept the fact that there is a knowledge that is imperfect, then knowledge of good and evil may be taken in two senses. It is certainly false to hold that the man who does not know good and evil is not different from a child. If it is wrong to maintain that such a man does not differ from a child, then Adam is not to be thought of as a child. If he was not a child, then surely he is liable to sin, inasmuch as he is not a child. If he is subject to sin, then punishment follows the sin, because the man who cannot avoid sin is reckoned to be liable to punishment. It can even happen that the person who has no knowledge of good and evil may not be a child: <i>'For before the child knew good and evil, he refused the evil.' </i>[ Isa 7:16 ] Again we read: <i>'For before the child knew to call his father and mother, he will receive the strength of Damascus and the toils of Samaria.' </i>[ Isa 8:4 ] Perfect, therefore, is the man who performs a good deed even if he has not attained the knowledge of good and evil, just as <i>'many are a law to themselves' </i>[ Rom 2:14 ] even before they know the Law. Was the Apostle before he learned: <i>'Thou shalt not lust,' quite unaware that concupiscence was a sin? On this point he says: </i><i>'I did not know sin save through the Law. For I had not known lust unless the Law had said, "Thou shalt not lust."' </i>[ Exod 20:17; Rom 7:7 ] Even a child can become by the law of nature perfect in that respect before he knows that concupiscence is a 
<hr />
<tt>Page 310</tt><br /><br />sin or admit the sin of concupiscence. Hence, God willed that man know the nature of evil in a superficial fashion lest, being imperfect, he may be unable to avoid evil. By not obeying a command we are subject to blame. We are thus led to admit our error. Again, if we are referring to a very profound knowledge of good and evil which in itself makes for perfection [Schenkl points to a lacuna in the manuscript here] a little child is not, like a grown-up, immediately to be chastised, because he has not yet reached a capacity to understand. 
<p><a name="div132"></a>Again, more criticisms crop up.[From Apelles; cf. Harnack, <i>op. cit </i>] There is the objection that a person who does not know good and evil is unaware that disobedience to a command is in itself an evil, nor is he aware that obedience to a command is itself a good. Hence it is argued that the person who is in this respect ignorant is deserving, not of condemnation, but of pardon. What we have already maintained above presents a ready solution to this problem. Man is capable of realizing that the utmost deference should be given to his Maker because of what God had already conferred on him, namely, the fact that God had breathed on him and that he was placed in the <span>Garden</span> of Delight. Wherefore, if he was ignorant of the meaning of good and evil. Nevertheless, since the Creator of such mighty things had declared that one should not eat of the tree of good and evil, loyal adherence should be given to Him who gave the command. It was not a question of technical knowledge, but of fidelity. He certainly was aware that God was in a position of preeminence and, as such, heed should be paid to His command. Although he did not understand the precise significance of the commands, he was conscious of the fact that deference should be paid to the person of the Commander. This conviction on his part stemmed from nature. He was as yet incapable of discriminating 
<hr />
<tt>Page 311</tt><br /><br />between good and evil. Wherefore the woman answers the serpent: <i>'Of the fruit of all the trees in the <span>garden</span> we shall eat, but of the fruit in the middle of the <span>garden</span>, God said, you shall not eat of it.' </i>[ Gen 3:2,3 ] She knew, therefore, that the command must be obeyed. Hence she said: We shall eat of every fruit which the Lord ordered, but God has given an order that one should not eat of the tree in the middle of the <span>Garden</span>, lest he die. Wherefore, she who knew that the command should be obeyed was surely aware that it was wrong not to comply with the command and that she would be justly condemned for her refusal to obey. 
<p><a name="div133"></a>One more point. The circumstances connected with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were such as to convince us that both good and evil were recognized. We are led to believe from the evidence of Scripture that such was the case: <i>'When they both ate, their eyes were opened and they realized that they were naked,' </i>[ Gen 3:6,7 ] that is, the eyes of their mind were opened and they realized the shame of being naked. For that reason, when the woman ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil she certainly sinned and realized that she had sinned. On realizing this, she should not have invited her husband to share in her sin. By enticing him and by giving him what she herself had tasted she did not nullify her sin; rather, she repeated it. Certainly it stands to reason that she did intend to lure the person whom she loved to share in her punishment. She should be expected to ward off from one who was unaware of it the danger of falling into a sin of which she had knowledge. Yet this woman, knowing that she could not remain in <span>Paradise</span> after the Fall, seems to have had a fear that she alone would be ejected from the <span>Garden</span>. Hence, after the Fall, they both went into hiding. Being 
<hr />
<tt>Page 312</tt><br /><br />aware, therefore, that she would have to be separated from the man she loved, she had no desire to be deceived. 
<p><a name="div134"></a>Another point. Knowledge of evil does not make evil. An act is necessary to complete its conditions. There is no immediate connection between the knower of what is evil and the doer. He is guilty who does what he knows to be evil. Either anger or cupidity is the customary means of arousing a person to perform an evil act. It does not necessarily follow that one who has knowledge of evil, unless he is the victim of anger or cupidity, will do what he knows is wrong. To repeat what we have said, the incentives to sin are anger and cupidity. To these we may add extreme fear, which itself may give rise to cupidity, inasmuch as everyone is anxious to avoid what is the cause of his fear. With reason, therefore, have we established that the incentives to the other vices are anger and cupidity. Let us consider, then, whether Eve was aroused to wrong-doing by these incentives. She was not angry with her consort. She was not a victim of cupidity. Again, she merely erred in giving her husband to eat of what she had already tasted. Cupidity had been at first responsible for her error in inducing him to eat and it was the occasion for the subsequent sin. This can be explained in the following way. She was unable to desire what she had already eaten and, after eating she acquired a knowledge of evil. She ought not, therefore, have made her husband a partaker of the evil of which she was conscious; neither should she have caused her own husband to violate the divine command. She sinned, therefore, with forethought, and knowingly made her husband a participant in her own wrong-doing. If it were not so, what is related of the tree of knowledge of good and evil would be found to be in error, if it were established that, after she ate of that tree, she was without knowledge of evil. But, if what Scripture says is true, cupidity was the motive of her act. Many, 
<hr />
<tt>Page 313</tt><br /><br />however, are of the opinion that she should be excused for the reason that, because she loved her husband, she was afraid that she would be separated from him. They offer this as grounds for her cupidity: namely, that she desired to be with her husband. 
<p><a name="div07"></a><a name="div135"></a>Still another problem arises.[From Apelles: cf. Harnack. <i>op. cit. </i>] From what source did death come to Adam? Was it from the nature of a tree of this sort or actually from God? If we ascribe this to the nature of the tree, then the fruit of this tree seems to be superior to the vivifying power of the breath of God, since its fruit had drawn into death's toils him on whom the divine breath had bestowed life. If we maintain that God is the responsible cause of death, then we can be held to accuse Him of inconsistency. We seem to accuse Him of being so devoid of beneficence as to be unwilling to pardon when He had the power to do so, or of being powerless if He was unable to forgive. Let us see, therefore, how this question can be resolved. The solution, unless I am mistaken, lies in the fact that, since disobedience was the cause of death, for that very reason, not God, but man himself, was the agent of his own death. If, for example, a physician were to prescribe to a patient what he thought should be avoided, and if the patient felt that these prohibitions were unnecessary, the physician is not responsible for the patient's death. Surely in that case the patient is guilty of causing his own death. Hence, God as a good physician forbade Adam to eat what would be injurious to him. 
<p><a name="div136"></a>Another point. To know what is good is better than 
<hr />
<tt>Page 314</tt><br /><br />to be ignorant of it. It is fitting that a person who knows what is good know, also, what is evil, in order that he may know the means to avoid it and, by taking the necessary precautions, that he may act with discretion. Again, it is not sufficient to know merely what is evil, lest, although you know what is evil, you may find yourself deprived of what is good. It is best, therefore, that we know both so that, since we know what is good, we may avoid evil. Again, from the fact that we are aware of evil we may give our preference to the charm of what is good. Moreover, we ought to know both so that our knowledge may be profound and so that we may put in practice what we know, act and acknowledge to be in perfect balance. Besides, Scripture points out that more is expected of him who has general knowledge of both than of him who is ignorant of them. [ Luke 13:47,48 ] Knowledge of what you cannot achieve or avoid is a grievous thing. Grievous, too, is knowledge which is not put into practice and into operation to its fullest extent. Without knowledge of what is harmful or beneficial to a patient and without the power of being able to utilize to the best advantage that knowledge, a physician is likely to act in such a way as to lose his reputation. Hence, knowledge is not salutary unless it is put into practice in the best possible way. 
<p><a name="div137"></a>Still another point. Not without reason was the tree of knowledge of good and evil grown in the middle of the <span>Garden</span>, and the prohibition against it was unnecessary if it was grown for each and every man. This tree was designed for the use of just one man, who received the command that he make use not only of that tree, but of the other trees besides. You can find many, even countless, instances in which a person can, because of ignorance of procedure, suffer real harm. Wealth itself will be found to be unprofitable to a rich man if he refuses to set in a 
<hr />
<tt>Page 315</tt><br /><br />generous fashion toward the poor. He may shut out the needy and deprive them of assistance and, because of his superior powers, he may extort for his own purpose what belongs to another. The very possession of beauty and of physical charm is more likely than deformity to lead one to vice. For that reason, therefore, does anyone desire to have children who are unsightly rather than handsome? Or desire their offspring to be poverty.stricken rather than well-to-do? There are many instances of this sort which are not to be ascribed to the lack of <span>wisdom</span> in the giver, but to the person who misuses the gifts. The fault lies not so much in the person who makes the gifts as in the person who makes use of them. 
<p><a name="div08"></a><a name="div138"></a>Another problem.[From Apelles] Did God know that Adam would violate His commands? Or was He unaware of it? If He did not know, we are faced with a limitation of His divine power. If He knew, yet gave a command which He was aware would be ignored, it is not God's providence to give an unnecessary order. It was in the nature of a superfluous act to give to Adam, the first created being, a command which He knew would not at all be observed. But God does nothing superfluous. Therefore, the words of Scripture do not come from God. This is the objection of those who do not, by interposing these questions, admit the authenticity of the Old Testament. But these people are to be condemned out of their own mouths. Since these same persons concede the authenticity of the New Testament, they must be convinced by evidence to believe in the Old. If they see that God is consistent in His commands and in 
<hr />
<tt>Page 316</tt><br /><br />His deeds, it is clear that they must concede that both Testaments are the work of one Author. The following example should convince them that a command to one who will disobey is not something superfluous or unjust. The Lord Himself chose Judas, one who, He knew, would betray Him. If these men think that he was chosen unwisely, they restrict the power of God. But they cannot hold this opinion, since Scripture declares: <i>'For Jesus knew who it was who should betray him.' </i>[ John 6:65 ] These defamers of the Old Testament should therefore hold their peace. 
<p><a name="div139"></a>Possible objections on the part of the Gentiles who do not admit this evidence stand in need of a response. Since the Gentiles demand a rational explanation, here is the reason why the Son of God either gave a command to one who is going to disobey it or has chosen one who is going to betray Him. The Lord Jesus came to save all sinners. [ Luke 19:10 ] He was bound to show concern even for the wicked. Accordingly, He was bound not to disregard one who was to betray Him. He wished that all might take note that in the choice even of His betrayer He was offering a sign for the salvation of all of us. No injury was done to Adam in that he received a command, or to Judas because he was chosen. God did not lay it down as a necessary consequence that one should disobey and the other should betray Him. Both could have abstained from sin if they had guarded what they had received. Hence, although He knew that all the Jews would not believe, He stated: <i>'I have not come except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.' </i>[ Matt 15:24 ] The fault is, therefore, not in the one issuing the command; the sin is rather in the one who disobeys. God's intent was this: He wanted to show to everyone that He willed to give freedom to all mankind. I do not mean to maintain that He did not 
<hr />
<tt>Page 317</tt><br /><br />know of the disobedience to come. Rather, I contend that He did know, but that He should not for that reason be subject to reproach for a betrayer who met death. God should not be accused of being the cause why both lapsed. In fact, both stand convicted and condemned, because one received a command not to fall into sin, and the other was enrolled among the Apostles in order that he, as the result of kindness, might change his intention to betray. At some time in the future when the other Apostles would be found wanting, he might well become a source of comfort to all. In effect, there would not exist any sin if there were no prohibition. Without the existence of sin there would be no such thing as wrong-doing or, perhaps, even virtue, which could not have any cause for existence or for preeminence without the aid of unrighteousness to offset it. What is sin, if not the violation of divine law and the disobedience to heavenly precepts? Not by the ear, but by the mind, do we form a judgment regarding injunction from above. But with the Word of God before us we are able to formulate opinions on what is good and what is evil. One of these we naturally understand should be, as evil, avoided, and the other we understand has been recommended to us as a good. In this respect we seem to be listening to the very voice of the Lord, whereby some things are forbidden and other things are advised. If a person does not comply with the injunctions which are believed to have been once ordained by God, he is considered to be liable to punishment. The commands of God are impressed in our hearts by the Spirit of the living God. We do not read these orders as if they were recorded in ink on a tablet of stone. [ 2 Cor 3:3 ] Hence, in our own thought we formulate a law: <i>'For if the Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the law prescribes, those having no law of this kind are a law unto </i>
<hr />
<tt>Page 318</tt><br /><br />themselves. They show the work of the law written in their hearts.' [ Rom 2:14,15 ] There is something, therefore, like the Law of God which exists in the hearts of men. 
<p><a name="div140"></a>These same people raise another objection. Instead of that command which we said was established in the mind of man, they would maintain that this very impression in our minds by God was itself the prescription of a divine law. The question is raised: Did the Creator of man know that man would fall into sin and so implanted those opinions of what is good and evil in the mind of man or was He unaware that this would happen? If you concede that He did not know of it, you attribute to God something alien to His majesty. If, on the other hand, you maintain that, although God was aware that man would sin, He impressed in man's mind a realization of what is good and evil, so that he would be unable, because of the admixture of evil, to live forever then in one case you imply that God was not prescient and in the other that He was not beneficent. From this the conclusion is reached that man was not the creation of God. We have already stated that these men maintain that God had not imposed a command. Now they say that man was not created by God, because God did not create evil. Man, on the other hand, had a mental conception of evil, inasmuch as he was enjoined to abstain from evil. In this way they venture to assert that there were two gods: one who is good; the other, the Creator of man. We must follow the lines of their own logic in formulating our reply. If they hold that man was not made by God, because man is a sinner, and if they recoil from conceding this point, lest a good God may not seem to the creator of sinners (because they do not believe that God is good who made a sinner) , then let them declare whether this artificer of man has in their opinion also been made by God? 
<hr />
<tt>Page 319</tt><br /><br />If, as they state, this artificer of man was created by God, how can it be possible that a God who is good is also the agent of evil? If the creator of a sinner is not good, then more serious implications result if we postulate the maker of him who is the artificer of a sinner. A God who is good is bound to prevent the birth of him who shall have to introduce the substance of sin. But if they maintain that this artificer was not created, than the problem arises as to whether a God who is good could or could not in any way prevent the growth of evil. If such a God cannot do this, then He is powerless. Inasmuch as such inconsistencies follow our line of argumentation and since the heretics get involved here, also, let us attempt a solution of the problem of why God allowed adversity to enter into this world through an artificer who either did or did not spring from Him, although He had the power to prevent it. 
<p><a name="div141"></a>Accordingly, while still holding that the God who is good and the one who is the artificer are one and the same, let us make clear what are the provinces of each. We should at the same time try to meet the objections of those who raise such a question as this: How is it possible that a God who is good has permitted not only adversity to enter this world but has allowed it, too, to be in such a state of disorder? [From Apelles] In truth, this objection would be valid only if this evil so affected the nature of our soul and the secret places of our hearts that riddance was impossible and if, again, this poison had left such deep wounds in our hearts and souls that medication was of no avail. [Cf. Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses </i>1:190] In fact, this grievance of theirs could be more aptly expressed by stating that, although God is omnipotent, He has permitted man to die. But since God in His pity has reserved for us the means 
<hr />
<tt>Page 320</tt><br /><br />of obtaining remedy for our sins and still has not rid us of all possibilities of contagion, then let us reflect on the following points. Would it be an unjust and unreasonable act if God, fearful, as it were, of man's frailty and mortality, permitted us to be tempted in such wise that, through penitence for our sins, grace compounded would return once more to our hearts? Again, would it be unjust if man, conscious and fearful of his own frailty (since he found that he could so easily deviate from the orderly path of divine commands) and fearful, too, lest he let loose these heavenly mandates which like a helm guide his soul-.would it be unjust if man should finally attribute the recovery of the helm to divine pity and by his safe return acquire some grace as well? 
<p><a name="div09"></a><a name="div142"></a>Now let us investigate the reason why God considered that a command should be given concerning the two classes of trees: the one to be eaten and the other which it was forbidden to eat. Thus, He laid down to man injunctions on the ways of attaining that wonderful and happy life, following which he might not have to suffer death. There are some who think that i[t] was totally inappropriate for the Creator of heaven and earth and of all things to lay down that command and that it was definitely unsuited to the inhabitants of <span>Paradise</span>, because life there was like that of the angels. And so we can conclude that the food provided for eating there was not earthly and corruptible, because those who do not drink or eat <i>'will be as the angels in heaven.' </i>[ ] There is no merit, therefore, in food, because food does not commend us to God. Neither is there great danger therein, because <i>'what goes into the mouth does not defile a man but it is what comes out of the mouth.' </i>[ Matt 22:30; 15:11 ] Undoubtedly, then, it would appear 
<hr />
<tt>Page 321</tt><br /><br />that the precept [is quite unworthy] of such a great Creator unless you take this food to mean prophetic food, because as a great reward the Lord makes this promise to His saints: <i>'Behold my servants shall eat and you shall be hungry.' </i>[ Isa 65:13 ] This is the food that makes for eternal life. Whoever is deprived of this will suffer death, since the Lord Himself is the living and heavenly Bread which gives life to this world. Hence He speaks: <i>'Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you shall not have life eternal.' </i>[ John 6:50; cf. 6:54 ] The bread was, therefore, meant for a certain person. Instructions were given that it should be eaten b[y] the inhabitants of <span>Paradise</span>. Who is that person? We are told who that person is: <i>'Man ate the bread of angels.' </i>[ Ps 77:25 ] The bread is good if you do the will of God. Do you wish to know how good that bread was? The Son of God Himself eats of that bread of which He says: <i>'My food is to do the will of my father who is in heaven.' </i>[ John 4:34 ] 
<p><a name="div143"></a><a name="glossGen2:17"></a>Again, let us see why the Lord God said to Adam: <i>'Ye shall die the death.' </i>[ Gen 2:17 ] What is the difference between saying 'ye shall die' and 'ye shall die the death'? We ought to point out that there is nothing superfluous in the command of God. Here is my solution. Since life and death are contradictory ideas, in unaffected language we say 'we live in life' and 'die in death.' But, if you wish, since life causes life, to double the force of the two concepts, the phrase 'he lives a life' is found in legal documents, and, since death causes death, there is the statement: <i>'He shall die the death.' </i>[ Ezek 33:14-16 ] These expressions are not redundant, for life is related to death and death to life, because everyone living no law of this kind are a law unto themselves. They show 
<hr />
<tt>Page 322</tt><br /><br />therefore, four categories: to live in life, to die in death, to die in life, to live in death. Since such is the case, we should put aside prejudices due to use and custom, for usage prescribes that the act of dying should be said without distinction of him who dies by death and of him who does so by his life. Accordingly, the Lord selects two of these four distinctive phrases so as to say that the living live, with qualifications as to whether well or ill, and the dying die, without a seeming difference between a good death and a bad one. There is no precise difference in fact between the kind of life or death here referred to. It could include that of irrational creatures or of tiny infants. 
<p><a name="div144"></a>Putting aside, therefore, conceptions due to common usage, let us reflect on the meaning of 'to live in life' and 'to die in death' and also 'to live in death' and 'to die in life.' I believe that, in accord with the Scriptures, 'to live in life' signifies a wonderful life of happiness and that it seems to point toward an experience of life's natural functions joined and, by participation, mingled with the grace of a blessed life. This concept, 'to live in life,' means 'to live in virtue,' to bring about in the life of this body of ours a participation in the life of blessedness. On the other hand, what does 'to die in death' mean if not the disintegration of the body at the time of death, when the flesh is devoid of its customary function of carrying on life and the soul is unable to partake in life eternal? There is also the person who 'dies in life,' that is to say, one who is alive in body but, because of his acts, is dead. These are the people who, as the Prophet says: <i>'Go down alive into hell,' </i>[ Ps 54:16 ] and she of whom the Apostle speaks: <i>'For she is dead while she is still alive.' </i>[ 1 Tim 5:6 ] There remains the fourth category, for there are those who 'live in death' like the holy martyrs who 
<hr />
<tt>Page 323</tt><br /><br />give up their lives so that they may live. The flesh dies, but what is good does survive. Far from us, therefore, be the thought of living as participants in death. On the contrary, we should face death and thus become sharers in life. The saint does not desire to be a participant in this life of ours when he states: <i>'To be dissolved and be with Christ.' </i>[ Phil 1:23 ] This has been much better stated by another: <i>'Woe to me that my sojourning has been prolonged,' </i>[ Ps 119:5 ] in grief certainly that he is limited by the fragility of this life, since he hopes for a share in life eternal. Wherefore I can, on the other hand, state that, although 'to live in life' is a good thing, 'to live for life' would be of doubtful benefit. One can speak of 'living for life,' that is, for the life of eternity with its struggle with the life of the body. One can also speak of 'living for life' in another sense. Anyone, even a pious person, can have a desire for this corporeal life of ours. We can take the example of one who thinks that he ought to live so virtuously as to arrive by his good actions at a ripe old age. Many people who are in weak health, but who still find life a pleasurable thing, are in this category. 
<p><a name="div145"></a>Now that we have examined the meaning of the phrase, 'to live for life,' let us now turn attention to the significance of the phrases, 'to die for death' and 'to live for death,' for it is possible to conceive of people who 'die for death' and who 'live for life.' For the person who 'dies for or to death' is one who so lives as to live for the sake of his own soul, because he is not subject to death. We mean by this one who has been loosed from the bonds of grievous death and one who is not bound by the chains of death eternal. He is dead to death, that is, he is dead 
<hr />
<tt>Page 324</tt><br /><br />to sin. He is dead to punishment for whom living is contrary to punishment, that is, when a person lives for punishment he lives for death. Again, one who dies for punishment dies for death. There is also the case of one who, although placed in this life, dies for life. Such was the situation of the Apostle who said: <i>'It is now no longer I that live, but Christ in me.' </i>[ Gal 2:20 ] To sin he is dead, but he lives for God, that is, death in him is dead, but living in him is that life which is the Lord Jesus. Good, therefore, is the life of those who live for God and wicked the life of those who live for sin. There is also a middle course of life, as in the case of other living creatures, for which we may cite the Scriptural passage: <i>'Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind.' </i>[ Gen 1:24 ] There is also the life of the dead: <i>'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,' </i>[ Exod 3:6 ] because <i>'He is not the God of the dead but of the living.' </i>[ Luke 20:37, Mark. 12:26 ] There are those who partake somewhat in both lives, that of the living and of the dead, of whom the Apostle speaks: <i>'If ye have died with him, ye shall also live with him.' </i>[ 2 Tim 2:11 ] The same Apostle has said: <i>'For if we have been united with him in the likeness of death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection also. For we know that our old self has been crucified with him, in order that the body of sin may be destroyed, that we may no longer be slaves to sin, for he who is dead is acquitted of sin.' </i>[ Rom 6:5.8 ] Just as we have said that there are many forms of life, so, too, we may discover many forms of death. An evil death is recorded in the words, <i>'The soul that sinneth, the same shall die.' </i>[ Ezek 18:20 ] The usual meaning of death appears when we 
<hr />
<tt>Page 325</tt><br /><br />say that a person lived so many years and was laid among his fathers. [ Acts 13:36 ] There is the meaning of death as we have it in the sacrament of baptism: <i>'For we were buried with him by means of baptism into death.' </i>[ ] Elsewhere we read: <i>'For if we have died with Christ, we believe also that we shall live together with him.' </i>[ Rom 6:4,8 ] You see how the word 'death' is subject to manifold interpretation, but that this life here is ours to contend with. 
<p><a name="div010"></a><a name="div146"></a><a name="glossGen2:18"></a>Still another question arises, that concerning the saying of the Lord: <i>'It is not good for man to be alone.' </i>[ Gen 2:18 ] Recognize the fact, first of all, that, when God created man from the slime of the earth, He did not add: <i>'God saw that it was good,' </i>[ Gen 1:14 ] as He did in the case of each of His works. If He had said at that time that the creation of man was good, then the other statement that 'it is not good' would be a contradiction in terms, although He had said that the creation of what preceded the formation of man was good. That was the situation at the time of the creation of Adam. But, when He perceived that man and woman were joined together in creation, He did not treat each even then in a special manner, for He soon after states: 'God saw that all he had ever made was very good.' [ Gen 1:31 ] The meaning is clear. The creation of both man and woman is considered to be good. 
<p><a name="div147"></a>From this question another problem arises. How did it 
<hr />
<tt>Page 326</tt><br /><br />happen that, when Adam alone was created, it was not said that it was good, but when a woman also was made, then are we to understand that everything was good? Whereas God in one case commended the whole of creation, as well as every creature in it (including man who is held to be a part of nature), a special reference to man did not then seem necessary. Wherefore, when Adam alone was created, an assertion that this work was good was not thought to be by any means a fitting climax to a satisfactory achievement. It was said, moreover, that it was not good for man to be alone. Yet we know that Adam did not commit sin before woman was created. However, after creation, she was the first to disobey the divine command and even allured her husband to sin. If, therefore, the woman is responsible for the sin, how then can her accession be considered a good? But, if you consider that the universe is in the care of God, then you will discover this fact, namely, that the Lord must have gained more pleasure for Himself in being responsible for all creation than condemnation from us for providing the basis for sin. Accordingly, the Lord declared that i[t] was not good for man to be alone, because the human race could not have been propagated from man alone. God preferred the existence of more than one whom He would be able to save than to have to confine this possibility to one man who was free from error. Inasmuch as He is the Author of both man and woman, He came into this world to redeem sinners. Finally, He did not permit Cain, a man accused of parricide, to perish before he brought forth sons. [ Gen 4:15-17 ] For the sake, therefore, of the successive generations of men it followed that woman had to be joined to man. Thus we must interpret the very words of God when He said the [NOTE: text wrong, should be that? -CA] it was not good for man to be alone. If the woman was to be 
<hr />
<tt>Page 327</tt><br /><br />the first one to sin, the fact that she was the one destined to bring forth redemption must not be excluded from the operations of Divine Providence. Although <i>'Adam was not deceived, the woman was deceived and was in sin.' </i>[ 1 Tim 2:14 ] Yet woman, we are told, <i>'will be saved by childbearing,' </i>5 in the course of which she generated Christ. 
<p><a name="div148"></a>Not without significance, too, is the fact that woman was made out of the rib of Adam. She was not made of the same earth with which he was formed, in order that we might realize that the physical nature of both man and woman is identical and that there was one source for the propagation of the human race. For that reason, neither was man created together with a woman, nor were two men and two women created at the beginning, but first a man and after that a woman. God willed it that human nature be established as one. Thus, from the very inception of the human stock He eliminated the possibility that many disparate natures should arise. He said: <i>'Let us make him a helper like himself.' </i>[ Gen 2:18 ] We understand that to mean a helper in the generation of the human family-a really good helper. If we take the word 'helper' in a good sense, then the woman's cooperation turns out to be something of major import in the process of generation, just as the earth by receiving, confining, and fostering the seed causes it to grow and produce fruit in time. In that respect, therefore, woman is a good helper even through in an inferior position. We find examples of this in our own experience. We see how men in high and important offices often enlist the help of men who are below them in rank and esteem. 
<hr />
<tt>Page 328</tt><br /><br />
<p><a name="div011"></a><a name="div149"></a><a name="glossGen2:19,Gen2:20"></a>Examine, now, the reason why God had by this time created out of the earth 'all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air' and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. How account for the fact that God brought merely the beasts of the field and the birds of the air to Adam? Animals were there, we know, each according to its kind. And so it is related further on: <i>'Adam named all the animals and all the beasts of the field, but he found no helper like himself.' </i>[ Gen 2:19,20 ] How can we explain this other than by saying that the untamed beasts and the birds of the air were brought to man by divine power, while man himself held power over the beasts that were tame and domesticated? The former lay within the province of God's activity. The latter were due to the diligence of man. Besides this, there is a reason why everything was brought to Adam. In this way he would be able to see that nature in every aspect is constituted of two sexes: male and female. Following these observations, he would become aware that association with a woman was a necessity of his lot. 
<p><a name="div150"></a><a name="glossGen2:21,Gen2:22,Gen2:23"></a><i>'And God cast Adam into a deep sleep and he slept.' </i>[ Gen 2:21 ] What does the phrase 'deep sleep' signify? Does it not mean that when we contemplate a conjugal union we seem to be turning our eyes gradually in the direction of God's kingdom? Do we not seem, as we enter into a vision of this world, to partake a little of things divine, while we find our repose in the midst of what is secular and mundane? Hence, after the statement, 'He cast Adam into a deep sleep and he slept,' there follows: <i>'The rib which God took from Adam he built into a woman.' </i>[ Gen 2:21,22 ] The word 'built' is well chosen in speaking of the creation of a woman because a 
<hr />
<tt>Page 329</tt><br /><br />household, comprising man and wife, seems to point toward a state of full perfection. One who is without a wife is regarded as being without a home. As man is considered to be more skillful in public duties, so woman is esteemed to be more adaptable to domestic ministrations. Reflect on the fact that He did not take a part from Adam's soul but a rib from his body, that is to say, not soul from a soul, but <i>'bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh' </i>[ Gen 2:23 ] will this woman be called. 
<p><a name="div151"></a>Thus we have made clear the cause of the generation of man. But many who reflect deeply on this question are disturbed by another problem. How explain the fact that animals and beasts of the field and birds of the air were in <span>Paradise</span>, if at the beginning God bestowed this great gift to men, namely, the privilege of living there and of expecting afterward that, as a reward of merit, all just men should be restored to that place? Hence, many hold that by <span>Paradise</span> is meant the soul of man and that, while man was placed there as a worker and guardian, certain seeds of virtue sprouted forth. This may be taken to mean that the mind of man, whose virtue it is to cultivate the soul intensively, not only performs its appropriate function, but also acts as a custodian of the work accomplished. The beasts of the field and the birds of the air which were brought to Adam are our irrational senses, because beasts and animals represent the diverse emotions of the body, whether of the more violent kind or even of the more temperate. What else are we to consider the birds of the air if not as representations of our idle thoughts which, like winged creatures, flit around our souls and frequently lead us by their varied motions now in one direction, now in another? Wherefore our faculty of perception, which in Greek is represented by the word <i>aithesis </i>constitutes the 
<hr />
<tt>Page 330</tt><br /><br />most congenial aid to the work of our minds. Except for our intellect [ <i>nous </i>] the mind has been unable to find another faculty so like itself. 
<p><a name="div152"></a>Perhaps you may argue that God is Himself the Author of error, because He also placed in such a <span>Paradise</span> entities such as these-I mean the passions of the body and the vanity of thoughts that are fleeting and empty. Take note of what He says: <i>'Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air and all the animals that crawl upon the earth.' </i>[ Gen 1:25 ] You see that He granted to you the power of being able to discern by the application of sober logic the species of each and every object, in order that you may be induced to form a judgment on all of them. God called them all to your attention, so that you might realize that your mind is superior to all of them. Why have you now willed to make part of yourself and to link close to you what you have discovered to be a totally alien substance? God surely has given you a sense of perception, whereby you can know things in general and can form a judgment about them. Because you were unable to observe God's commands you were deservedly ejected from that fertile <span>Garden</span>. God came to the realization that you were weak and could not discriminate. Hence, He spoke to men in their weakness. <i>'Do not judge that you may not be judged.' </i>[ Matt 7:1 ] He bade you, therefore, to be obedient to His imposed command, because He knew that your judgment was weak. If you had not disregarded this order, you would never ha[ve] run the risk of wavering in your judgment. And, since you wished to form a judgment, for that reason He added: <i>'Indeed Adam has become like one of us, knowing good and evil.' </i>[ Gen 3:22 ] You desired to claim judgment as your right. Hence you ought not to oppose the penalty for misguided judgment. 
<hr />
<tt>Page 331</tt><br /><br />Nevertheless, He placed you in such a position outside <span>Paradise</span> that the recollection of it may never leave you. 
<p><a name="div153"></a>Hence the just are caught up into <span>Paradise</span>, just as Paul <i>'was caught up into <span>paradise</span> and heard secret words that man may not repeat.' </i>[ 2 Cor 12:4,5 ] And if by the vigor of your mind you are caught up from the first heaven to the second and from the second heaven to the third, we can explain it in this way. Each and every man is first of all corporeal; secondly, he is of a sensual nature; and thirdly, he is spiritual in that he is carried to the third heaven to behold the brilliance of spiritual grace. <i>'The sensual man does not perceive the things that are of the Spirit.' </i>[ 1 Cor 2:14 ] For that reason the ascent into the third heaven is necessary for him in order that he may be caught up into <span>Paradise</span>. At this stage, without incurring danger, you will be caught up, in order that you may be able to pass judgment on all things, because <i>'the spiritual man judges all things and he himself is judged by no man.' </i>[ 1 Cor 2:15 ] Perchance, although still infirm, you will hear secret words that man may not repeat. Forbear to reveal anything and keep in your heart what you shall hear. Paul the Apostle kept these words in his heart lest he fall and for a certainty lead others into sin. Or perhaps Paul used the words <i>'that man may not repeat' </i>[ 2 Cor 12:4 ] because he was still in the body, that is to say, because he saw the passions of this body of ours and because he saw the law of his flesh <i>'warring against the law of his mind.' </i>[ Rom 7:23 ] I prefer to take the meaning in this sense, lest the question of future danger should seem to be disregarded. That would imply freedom during our lifetime from the anxiety and dread of snares which might lead to sin in the future. Whoever, 
<hr />
<tt>Page 332</tt><br /><br />therefore, shall reach upward into <span>Paradise</span> by the exercise of virtue will hear those hidden and secret words of God. He shall hear, too, the Lord speaking as to the repentant thief who abandoned his life of thievery for one of faith: <i>'This day thou shalt be with me in <span>paradise</span>.' </i>[ Luke 23:43 ]

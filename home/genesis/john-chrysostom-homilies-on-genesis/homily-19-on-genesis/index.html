exhortations that remind her of virtue; it is not an effect of his
helplessness; no, the soul is free, and it remains free, even under the yoke of
sin, to follow the inspirations of God who will help, but not force it. 2. God
is so good that he deigned to interrogate Cain after his crime, he questioned
him to excite him to repent, and to find a way to show him mercy. 3. Cain after
his arrogant and impious response, was cursed of God. Difference between this
curse and that which God pronounced after the sin of Adam; this one strikes the
earth, that one the sinner Cain himself. 4. Penance and confession are useless
when they are used outside the proper time. 5. What do the seven vengeances for
the one who will kill Cain mean? - 6. Exhortation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

energetic remedies nor to those which have the effect of softening; likewise
when a soul once became captive to the devil, that it has committed some sin
and that it does not even want to understand its interest, then it is vain to
lavish on it the instructions and the councils, it is lost grief, and it takes
no more advantage of the exhortation than if the sense of hearing was dead in
it, which happens not for want of power, but for want of will. This is how the
vices of the will differ from the infirmities of the body. As for the body, the
affections that come from nature are for the most part incurable; it is quite
different from the free will. As bad as one is, one can, if one wants to,
change and become good, and one can also, although good, slip to evil if one
neglects oneself.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">After having made our nature capable of
self-determination, the God who is the author of all things, who is goodness in
essence, neglects nothing to bring us to good, and as he knows the most
intimate feelings, the most secret, agitating in the depths of our hearts, he
exhorts us, he advises us, he warns our bad designs. It is not that he uses
constraint, but he uses remedies appropriate to the ills of each, and then he
abandons everything to the decision of the patient.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">This is the conduct he has held especially with regard
to Cain. See, however, in what an abyss of malice this one has fallen, in spite
of the efforts of a providence so attentive! He must, since he was conscious of
the crime he meditated, apply only to correct the perversity of his thought;
but not dominated by a sort of intoxication, to the wound which his soul has
already received he has brought a second; as for the remedy which was applied
to him with such a gentle hand, he can not bear it, but he hastens to execute
the murder of which he has conceived the black design; he goes about it with
cunning and cunning, he finds misleading words to make his brother fall into the
trap. Such is the ferocity of the man who turns to evil. Great and respectable
when his effort tends to good, this reasonable animal becomes as basely cruel
as ferocious beasts when it is towards the evil that its energy is directed.
His (114) natural sweetness and reason are changed into ferocity and brutality,
so much so that he prevails in this respect over the very beasts of the
forests.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But let's see the story. And Cain said to his brother,
Let's go out into the country. Fraternal words intended to conceal a homicidal
project. What are you doing, Cain? Do not you know who you are talking to? Do
you forget that this word is addressed to your brother? Do not you think that
he came out of the same breast as you? Is not your conscience struck by what is
abominable in your design? Do you not fear the infallible judge? Do not you
shudder at the thought of your company? What is your goal in dragging your
brother into the countryside, tearing his paternal arms? Why do you want to
deprive him of his father's help? What is new so that you take your brother to
the countryside, so that you do what you are not used to, so that under the
pretext of showing him the friendship of a brother, are you prepared to treat
him with the cruelty of an implacable enemy? Where does this rage come from?
Why this rabies? Either your conscience is blinded, the feelings you have for a
brother, you have stifled them, you have silenced the voice of nature; but why
declare war on him who has not done you any harm? And your parents? What do you
have to reproach them for in order to inflict upon them, deliberately, a
mourning which will now overwhelm their existence, to display the first before
their eyes the dreadful spectacle of death, and a violent death? Is this how
you reward them for raising you? What artifice of the devil led you to this
action? You can not even say that the benevolence of the Sovereign Master
towards your brother has inspired him with disdain for you. To prevent the
outbursts of your homicide nature, the Lord did not submit this brother to your
authority? Did he not say: In you will be his recourse, and you will be his
master? These words indeed mark the submission of Abel to Cain. Some
interpreters hear them of the sacrifice offered to God, who would have said to Cain:
the return (apostrophe can mean also recourse and return) of him, that is to
say of your sacrifice, will be towards you, and you will be master from him,
that is to say, you will enjoy it. I give these two interpretations to your
intelligence, and I leave you free to choose the one that seems more suitable
to you. As for me, I bow for the first.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And it came to pass, as they were in the field, that
Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. A terrible attack!
horrible package! abominable action! unforgivable sin! design conceived in a
fierce soul! He rose against his brother Abel and killed him. O villainous
hand! O criminal arm; or rather it is not the hand that must be called
scoundrel, but the thought whose hand was only the instrument. Let us say, O
reckless thought, miserable and criminal! say everything we want, because we
can not say enough. How does this hand not become numb? How, she said, did she
carry the blow? How did the soul of the murderer not fly away from his body?
How could she have the strength to execute such a horrible attack? How did she
not flinch, and change her design? How did she stifle the voice of nature? How,
before executing, did she not consider the consequences of the execution? How,
after the murder, would the murderer have the heart to see the body of his
brother throb on the ground? How could he sustain the sight of a dead body
lying on the ground without feeling the bonds of life in him? If we who live so
many centuries later, who every day see the dying, we are so moved by the
spectacle of a death even natural, and that when it comes to men who are nothing
to us, that we feel our force us to abandon ourselves, that our strongest
hatred does not survive the death of an enemy; how much more did Cain have for
life to be extinguished in his heart, for his soul to flee for ever from his
body, who saw the one who had just spoken to him, this brother who had the same
mother and the same father as he, the one who had been borne in the same womb,
the one for whom God had shown special benevolence. who saw him suddenly
deprived of life and motion, and only throbbing on the ground where he lay?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">2. But let's see again, after
such an unforgivable attack, let us see from what condescension, what goodness
the sovereign lord of all things has towards the culprit. And God said to Cain.
What proof of kindness already to address the jay had just committed such a
crime! If we reject as odious our parents who have been dishonored by crime, it
is a reason for (115) more to admire the good God when he uses so much
patience. Because God is a doctor, he is a very tender father: as a doctor he
gives all his care to the healing of those who suffer: as a tender father he
tries to bring back to their first happiness those of his children who are
fallen. by their fault the privileges of their birth. He therefore wishes,
because of his immense goodness, to show kindness to this great culprit, and he
says to him: Where is your brother Abel? Astonishing, and infinite patience of
God! If he questions, it is not that he does not know: he had already
questioned the father after his fault, nothing prevented him from using the
same with the son. Sending Adam, who was hiding because of the shame his
nakedness gave him, he asked him, Where are you? (Gen. III, 9.) He was not
unaware where he was, but he wanted, by exciting him to trust, to lead him to
obliterate his sin by the confession he would make of it. Such is his ordinary
conduct: he provokes and first demands the confession of sins, then he grants
pardon; therefore he now asks Cain, and saith unto him, Where is thy brother
Abel? He pretends to ignore, this merciful Master; he tries to bring by his
questions the culprit to the confession of his sin, so that he can thus obtain
his pardon and find mercy. Where is your brother Abel?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">What does this man, without heart, without entrails,
answer, that rash man, that impudent man? He must have thought that God knew
nothing whatever he questioned, that he wanted to provoke a confession, while
at the same time informing us that we must not condemn anyone until we have
heard and convinced him; he must remember the counsel of God, who had tried to
prevent this crime; from God, who, seeing beforehand his culpable designs, had
endeavored to prevent their execution; he had to make all these reflections and
not to push further his criminal madness; he had to say what he had done, show
his wound to the doctor, and receive from him remedies for his cure; but, on
the contrary, he aggravates his wound even more, he renders his wound deeper.
He replied: I do not know. What an impudent answer! Is the man you are talking
to a man, that you tried to deceive him? Do you not know, miserable man, who is
He with whom you speak? Do you not see that it is from kindness that he asks
you, that he seeks an opportunity to show his mercy, that he wants to do for
you everything that depends on him, so that on the day of the condemnation you
have no more excuses to present, since you will have run from yourself in front
of the punishment?</span><br /></p></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And he answered: I do not know. Am I the guardian of
my brother? Notice here with me the force of an accusing conscience, see how,
pushed by this consciousness, it does not limit itself to saying: I do not
know, but it adds: am I the guardian of my brother? Word by which he condemns
himself, very nearly, expressly. Yes, certainly, if one wanted with you to
proceed with the rigor, one would say to you that, according to the law of the
nature, you were obliged to be the guardian of the salvation of your brother.
It is indeed a law of nature that those born of the same womb must mutually
keep and defend. If you did not want to fulfill this duty, or be the guardian
of your brother, why did you become his murderer? why did you kill him who did
not hurt him? Did you believe, then, that there would be no witness to convince
you? But wait, and you will see an accuser rise in the one you killed; yes,
this dead brother lying on the ground will accuse you aloud, you who live, you
who walk.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God said, why did you do that? How many things in
this brief word! Why did you do that, commit this abominable crime, this
execrable action, this inexpiable crime, this work of incredible madness, this
murder, new sin, unheard of, and for the first time introduced by, your hand in
the life of men? Why did you commit this big, this. frightful sin, I no more
grievance that can be committed? The voice of your brother's blood cries from
the earth to me. Do you think that I am like men who hear no voice other than
the one whose language is the organ? I am God, and I hear the voice of the
blood that the murder has shed; I hear the complaints of the unfortunate man
who has been killed by the homicide. Do you see how far the voice of this blood
is! it ascends from the earth to the sky, it even crosses the celestial
regions, arrives higher than the powers from above, to the throne of the great
King, where it accuses by moaning your parricide. The voice of your brother's
blood cries from the earth to me. It's not a stranger, an enemy that your hand
has hit; it was your brother, your brother, who had not offended you in any
way. Perhaps the benevolence that I showed to her was the cause of her death,
and as she could not reproach me, you made the weight of your anger fall on
him. That is why I will inflict on you a punishment that will not let your
crime fall into oblivion, a punishment that will serve as an example and a
lesson to all future men. And now, since you have done this, since you have
done your evil design, and the excess of envy has precipitated you into murder,
you will be cursed on the earth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

differs from that of Adam? Do not go carelessly, but by the greatness of the
curse understand the enormity of the crime. How much more sinful this sin was
than the prevarication of the first man, you can judge by the difference of the
curse. God said to Adam, "The earth is cursed in your works" (Gen.
III, 17), spreading the curse on the earth and sparing man out of kindness; but
here, as the work is deadly, that it is a crime, a monstrous and unforgivable
iniquity, it is Cain himself who is struck by a curse.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And now you are cursed on the earth. He had
practically done the same thing as the serpent, he had like him served as an
instrument at the thought of the devil, as he used the cunning to introduce
death into the world, since he had deceived his brother to do so to go out into
the country, and having armed his hand, he had killed him. So God, who cursed
the serpent, You will be cursed among the beasts of the earth, God also cursed
Cain, whose work resembled that of the serpent. The devil was tormented by
envy; he could not see without bitter vexation the immense blessings with which
God had filled man from the first day of his life; that is why he wove an
artificial train that introduced death into the world. In the same way Cain
looked enviously and jealously at the special benevolence of God for Abel, and
from envy he went on to murder. This is why God says to him: You will be cursed
on the earth. You will be an abomination to this very land that has opened its
mouth to receive from your hand the blood of your brother. Yes, it will repel
you with horror, this earth, because it is indignant to have been sprinkled
with such blood, stained with such a crime, outraged by your homicidal hand.</span><br /></p></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Then the Holy Scripture, interpreting the curse, adds:
When you have cultivated it, it will not give its fruit. Terrible punishment
and denotes great indignation in the person who inflicts it. Thou shalt bear
the burden of labor, thou shalt employ all that thou hast forcibly to cultivate
this soil soiled with this blood, and thou shalt not gather any fruit from thy
hard labors; whatever pain you endure, it will not produce anything. There will
not be limited your punishment, but you will moan and trembling through the
earth. What greater torture to always moan and tremble! Since you have not
served your body strength and the vigor of your limbs properly, here I am
bothering you with continual agitation and trembling, not only so that you have
a perpetual warning and imperishable remembrance of your crime yourself, but
also that all who see you will be instructed by sight alone, so that your only
appearance will be like a powerful voice warning the spectators to abstain from
if they want to avoid punishment, so that the punishment that will weigh on you
teaches men not to defile the earth with the blood of their brethren. And to
better achieve this goal, I will not make you die too soon, lest your lump sum
be forgotten, but I will make you live a life more painful than death, so that
you know what is your crime.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

me to be forgiven. This is a word which, if we are attentive, will furnish us
with a very important and very useful teaching for our salvation. And Cain
said, My crime is too great for me to be forgiven. The confession is complete.
My sin is so great, he says, that it is not possible for me to receive
forgiveness. So he confessed, and confessed entirely? Yes, but without any
profit, because he did it in an untimely way. It should have been done in due
time, while the Judge was disposed to mercy. Remember what I told you before,
that in this terrible last day, and before the Tribunal where there will be no
acceptance of persons, each one of us will feel a sharp repentance of his sins,
when he will have before his eyes the now inevitable torments and punishments
of hell, but it will be a useless repentance, because it (117) will not happen
in a proper time.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

time, and its virtue is immense. That is why, I conjure you, while this
admirable remedy still retains its efficiency, hasten to take advantage of it;

convinced that it will be useless to repent after the tragedy of this world is
played and when the time of the struggles is past.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">4. Let's go back to our subject. It was when the Lord
asked him, Where is your brother Abel? that Cain must confess his sin,
prostrate himself, pray, implore mercy. But then he refused the remedy, and
now, after the sentence pronounced, when all is over, when the voice of the
bloodshed has loudly heard an overwhelming accusation, he confesses, but
belated and useless confession, against which stands the word of the Prophet:
The righteous himself is his accuser in the first place. (Prov., XVIII, 77.)
Cain himself, if he had warned the reprimand, would have been judged worthy of
some pity, so great is divine mercy. There is no sin, however great, that
surpasses the charity of God for men, provided we do penance at the proper time
and implore our forgiveness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

forgiven. Confession sufficient, but untimely. Cain said again, "If you
drive me out of the earth today, I will go and hide myself from your face, and
I will be groaning and trembling on the earth; and it will happen that whoever
finds me will kill me. Words that excite pity! Unfortunately, they come too
late, and the lack of opportunity robs them of all value: If you drive me out,
from the earth, I will hide from your face, and I will be moaning and trembling
on the earth. ; and it will happen that whoever meets me will kill me. Since
you have made me execrable to the earth, since you repulse me yourself, that
you give me to a punishment so severe, that it must make me moan and tremble,
nothing will prevent from now on, that being in this state, and without any
help on your part, I am not killed by the first who will meet me. I will be
easy to win for the first comer who wants to take my life. I do not have the
strength to resist on my own with these limbs impeded and agitated by a
continual trembling; besides, it will be known that you have deprived me of
your assistance, and this motive will determine to kill those who desire it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

increase your pain, I will leave you to instruct future generations as a living
example; your aspect will make you wise, and nobody, seeing you, will have the
desire to imitate your conduct. And the Lord says, No, it will not be so,

of Cain will be punished by seven punishments. Be attentive, please. As I have
often said to your charity these past days, if, now that the time of fasting
brings us so much tranquility, and it removes from our minds thoughts that
would be likely to disturb them, we Let us not study with much care the
teachings included in the (118) divine Scriptures, in what other time can we do
it? I beg you, I entreat you, and, ready to throw myself on your knees, I
beseech you to listen to what I say to you with an attentive mind, so that you
do not retire to your houses without carrying away here is something that
elevates your souls and brings them to God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">What does this word mean: will he be responsible for
seven vengeances? Let us first observe that in Holy Scripture the number seven
is often used indeterminately and means many or many; for example, one reads in
the first book of Kings (II, 5): The one who was sterile has become a mother of
seven, that is to say a large number of children. There are many examples of
such a meaning. Here the Scripture gives us a glimpse of the enormity of Cain's
package, since it does not consider it a single sin, but as constituting seven
sins, for each of which severe punishment is intended. Let's try to list these
sins. First of all, he envied his brother because of the benevolence God showed
him, and he would not have needed more to lose him; secondly, it is his own
brother that he envies; third, it tends to be a trap; fourth, he commits murder;
fifthly, it is his own brother that he kills; sixth, he is the author of the
first murder that was committed; seventh, he lies to God. Have you followed
this enumeration, or must I resume it by showing you that each of these
aggravating circumstances deserves a serious torture? To envy the one whom God
favors is this excusable? This is already an unforgivable mistake. It gets even
worse when it is to a brother, from whom one has suffered no injustice, that
one envies. So this is still a sin that is not the smallest. It is a third
fault to lay a trap, to deceive, to lead into the country, to trample on
nature. Murder forms the fourth sin. The fifth results from the fact that it is
a brother who is put to death, a brother born of the same breast. Introducing a
new kind of sin into the world is the sixth sin. The seventh sin: the murderer
dares to lie to God who deigns to question him. This is why God says: He who
tries to kill him will take the burden of seven vengeance upon himself. So, do
not be afraid of that; for behold, I put on you a sign that will make you
recognize whoever will meet you. Your infirmity will be useful to future
generations, and this crime which you have committed without witness, all will
learn by seeing you tremble and groan; This trembling of your whole body will
be like a voice heard by all, which will say: Let no one do what I have done,
lest, if he dares, he be struck by such a punishment.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">6. May these teachings be engraved in your minds, my
dear brothers; and that they do not just do that, brush them by the way. To
come here every day to feed on the nourishment of the holy word is very good,
but that is not enough, it will be of no use to you to hear the law of God if
you do not practice it. Having always present to the thought the sin of Cain,
its causes and unforgivable enormity, of Cain become homicide for envy,
homicide of a brother who had done him no harm, let us fear much less to suffer
ourselves from harm than to to cause others. Evil truly strikes only one who
tries to harm his neighbor. So that you are convinced, look here with me which
of the two is the most unfortunate, who kills or who is killed. Is it not
obvious that he is the murderer? Why? because here the praise of him who has
been slain is still in every mouth, because his name is always pronounced with
admiration, like that of the first martyr of truth, as Blessed Paul says: All
dead that he is, Abel still speaks. (Heb XI, 4.) But the murderer, besides
having lived more miserably than all men, has remained odious to all mankind,
and the Holy Scripture continually offers it to all ages as a terrible example.
of divine vengeance and curse. Such is the parallel for this present and
perishable life; but if we wished to pursue it to the other life where the
righteous Judge will render to each according to his works, what speech could
express all that there will be happiness on the one hand, misfortune on the
other. For Abel, the kingdom of heaven, the eternal tabernacles, the choruses
of the patriarchs, prophets and apostles, and the great assembly of saints,
where he will reign for ever and ever in the company of the King Jesus Christ,
(119) unique of God and God himself; for Cain, the hell of fire, and thousands
of other torments that will torment him forever; he will be there with all the
murderers like himself; However, divine vengeance will be more rigorous against
those who, under the rule of the law of grace, have become slaves of the most
vile passions. Listen, indeed, what St. Paul says: All who have sinned without
the law, shall perish without the law (Romans II, 12); that is to say, will
suffer a lighter penalty because they have not had a law to keep them in good
by a threatening sanction, but all who have sinned under the law will be judged
by the law; that is to say, all other conditions being equal, those who have
benefited from the help of the law will endure more rigorous punishment. And
nothing is more just, since neither the law nor the example of the misfortunes
of others will have made them more temperate and virtuous. I conjure you
therefore, take advantage at least, from now on, of the teachings of others to
become wiser; Let us finally lead our lives according to the law of the Lord,
obey his commandments. Let neither envy, nor jealousy, nor carnal love, nor
glory, nor the other miserable benefits of this life, nor the gross pleasures
of the table, nor any other bad passion, reign over the thoughts of our hearts
. Let us be rid of all obscenity and worldly pleasure; let us say goodbye to
all our shameful and illicit attachments, and strive with all our strength for
that blessed life, for those ineffable goods which God has prepared for those
who love him; May we be found worthy by the grace and charity of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom glory, power, honor, be to the Father and to the Holy Spirit,
now and forever, and for ever and ever. So be it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

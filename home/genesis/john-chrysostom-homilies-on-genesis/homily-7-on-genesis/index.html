criticisms, and announced that he would now speak in a softer language. He
again exhorts his hearers not to frequent the circus, and because of the harm
they do to themselves, and especially the scandal they give to Jews and pagans.
He takes occasion to speak of the scandal and to show what is the sinisterness
of this sin. 3. He then proceeds to the explanation of the twentieth and
twenty-first verse of Genesis, and describes the power and efficacy of the
divine word in the creation of fish and birds. 4. He also points out that the
purpose of the Holy Spirit was to prevent men from falling into idolatry in the
so detailed account of all creation. 5. God's blessing on fish and birds leads
the orator to glorify the goodness and power of the Lord. The work of the fifth
day having thus been completed, he explains the creation of terrestrial
animals, and proves what are, in our respect, convenience and utility. - 6 and
7. At the moment of approaching the creation of man, he interrupts himself not
to lengthen his speech and ends with some moral reflections on the madness of
idolatry, to which he opposes the happy influence of a pious and Christian
life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">1. Yesterday I spoke with keen reproaches to those who
had attended the racecourse races, and I explained to them the greatness of the
damage they had suffered. And in fact they dispelled the spiritual treasure
which they had amassed by fasting, so that from rich they fell suddenly into
extreme poverty. But today I want to use a softer remedy, and heal the wounds
of their soul, as I would heal my own wounds. Yesterday, I confess, I applied a
violent remedy, not, of course, to grieve you and increase your pain, but to
penetrate to the quickest of the ulcer by the violence of the remedy. This is
how doctors and fathers act. The former use an energetic ointment to force the
tumor to open, and then treat it with softening ointments. And the second also,
when they see their children fall into serious faults, correct them at first
severely, and then address them with tender reproaches and gentle exhortations.
And I too, because yesterday I spoke to you with force and vehemence, I will
hold you today only a language full of sweetness, because I consider you as a
part of myself. I therefore feel inclined to speak to you with all the more
frankness that I have a greater desire for your salvation. Hey! what is my
spiritual treasure, if not your advancement in piety? That is why I am happy,
when I see you rich in virtues, and attentive to avoid anything that could harm
your souls. But also when I see that you succumb to sin, and that you let
yourself be seduced by the illusions of the devil, I grieve deeply, and
confusion covers my face, for I am applying this word of the Apostle: We live
now, if you remain steadfast in the Lord. (I Thes, III, 8.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">So act as perfect and full men (36) of the Spirit of
wisdom, forget what is behind you, and strive forward to what is before you.
And since you renew your first commitments today with Jesus Christ, keep them
firm and inviolable. May Christian prudence now shut the entrance of your
hearts to all the seductions of the devil; and remember nothing to repair your
past negligence, and to erase from your soul the stain of sin. So correct the bad
and bad custom of attending the racecourse races; and be well persuaded that
those who run with such eagerness, are much harmed, and by their culpable
curiosity, and by the scandal which they give to the Jews and the pagans. And
indeed when they see pell-mell with them in the circus of the Christians who
come every day to the church, and who receive there the holy doctrine, what can
they think of our mysteries? will they not take them for illusions, and
ourselves for impostors? Do you not hear the blessed Paul who cries aloud to
us: Do not give occasion for scandal. But who? to Christians only, and to those
of our belief? certainly not; but first to the Jews, then to the Gentiles, and
finally to the Church of God. (1 Corinthians X, 32.) For nothing is more
harmful and more fatal to our religion than to scandalize the infidels. And
indeed when they see Christians point out by their virtues, and take as pity of
the heavens human life; his interests and his preoccupations, some are roused
with admiration, and the others are dumb with astonishment, because, men like
us, they can not rise to this heroism. But as soon as they catch the faithful
in some relaxation, or some negligence, they suddenly sharpen their language
against all of us, and judge of all Christians by the fault of one. What did I
say? they make their blasphemies reflect upon our Divine Chief himself, whose
religion they criticize, and they oppose to us the cowardice of some bad
Christians as a legitimate excuse for their errors.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">2. But do you want to know how many are guilty coughs
that give occasion to this scandal? listen to the prophet Isaiah who says to
us, in the name of the Lord, Woe to you, because my name is blasphemed because
of you among the Gentiles! This word is terrible, and very proper to fill us
with fright. For this word, misfortune, is like an exclamation of pain at the
sight of the inevitable torment to which those exposed by scandal are exposed.
But if they can not avoid a severe condemnation, and frightful chastisements,
because their negligence has blasphemed the name of the Lord, let us also say
that the zeal of virtue and good example becomes a title to the most beautiful
rewards. This is what Jesus Christ himself teaches us when he says to us: Let
your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew V, 16). For if the pagans are
scandalized by the conduct of some Christians, and take occasion to sharpen
their tongues against God, by a contrary effect, says the Savior, the men who
admire in you the practice of all the virtues, will not be able to first you
rent; and seeing the splendor of your good works, and the splendor which
springs upon them, they will feel inclined to glorify your Father who is in
heaven; and this glory which we have thus procured for the Lord will increase
our merits, and He Himself will reward us with the richest favors. He assures
us in these terms: I will glorify those who will glorify me. (I Kings, II, 30.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Let us spare nothing, my dear brothers, to glorify the
Lord our God, and give no occasion for scandal. The doctor of the nations,
Blessed Paul, constantly recommends it to us, and he says to us, If what I eat
scandalizes my brother, I will never eat any meat; and he had said before that sinning
against our brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, we sin against Jesus
Christ. (I Corinthians VIII, 12, 13.) These threats are terrible, and lead to a
severe condemnation. It is as if the Apostle were saying to us: Take care not
to believe that the scandal only reaches your brother, he reflects on the
Christ who was crucified for your brother. But if your Master did not disdain
to suffer the death of the cross because of him, can you take too much
precautions not to scandalize him?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Such are the counsels which he gives in all
circumstances to his disciples, and which he recommends to them as an excellent
means of preserving in them the life of charity. This is why he writes to the
Philippians: Let each have in sight not his own interests, but those of others;
and speaking to the Corinthians, he said, All things are lawful to me, but all
things are not made. (Philip II, 4 ... I Corinthians X, 23.) Admire the wisdom
of the Apostle! Although he is free, he says, to do certain acts which can not
be prejudicial to me, I will abstain from doing so, if my brother is to be so
edified. See how much Paul's heart loves us, and how he forgets his own
interests to prove to us in a thousand ways the first of all virtues. is to
apply ourselves to edifying the next. Educated at the school of such a master,
let us observe his precepts, I conjure you, and avoid all that might be for our
brothers an opportunity to lose their spiritual riches. Yes, never do anything
that causes our brothers any damage. For the bad example makes our sin more
serious, and exposes us to more rigorous tortures. Do not despise anyone, even
the last of them. our brothers; and never say this, cold word: I do not care
that such a person is scandalized. How! I do not care, do you? But does not
Jesus Christ want our good works to shine outside so that those who see them
may be edified and glorify the Lord? And you, on the contrary, very far from
procuring the glory of God, you are the cause that it is blasphemed, and you
have no problem! Is this conduct worthy of a pious Christian and instructed in
his religion?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">3. Moreover, those who have hitherto abandoned
themselves to this pernicious custom, correct themselves today on our urgent
invitations, and henceforth abstain from all un-edifying words. Let everyone
therefore study doing nothing with which the eye of the Lord, an ever-open and
ever vigilant eye, is hurt, or that his own conscience may reproach him as an
occasion for scandal and blasphemy for all who witness it. . If we act in all
things with these precautions, we will draw on us the mercies of the Lord, and
we will avoid the pitfalls of the devil. For in seeing us thus attentive and
vigilant, he will lose all hope of conquering us, and will retire shamefully.
But this exordium is long enough, and it is time to serve your charity as a
spiritual feast by explaining to you the passage of Genesis which has just been
read. Let us see what Moses wants to teach us today, or rather the Holy Spirit
who speaks to us through his mouth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

swim in the water, and birds flying on the earth under the firmament of heaven;
and it was done so. Admire here with what kindness the Lord makes known to us
the order and the continuation of the works of creation. At first he revealed
to us how, at his order, the earth had effected from his bosom his various
productions; then he told us of the formation of these two great luminous
bodies, to which he added the variety of stars which adorn the sky with their
brilliant brilliancy; and today, passing on to the element of waters, he
teaches us that, by his word and command, they themselves produce living
animals: That the waters, he says, produce living animals that swim in the
water. water, and birds flying on the earth, under the skies of heaven. But
what word, I ask you, could worthily tell this prodigy! and what language would
suffice to praise this work of a creator God! he had only said: that the earth
produces plants, and suddenly the earth was covered with the richest
productions; and today he says that the waters produce. These two commandments
were followed by the same effects; there he had said: let the earth produce
plants; and here he says that the waters produce living animals. But as with
his first order: that the earth should produce, the earth had given birth to
plants and flowers, harvests, and all other productions so varied and numerous;
thus to this second order: that the waters produce living animals that swim in
the water, and birds flying on the earth, under the firmament of the sky, we
saw appear fish and birds in so many numbers that can not count them. But as
much as the word of the Lord is brief and concise, so are the species of fish
and birds numerous and varied. And do not be surprised, my dear brother, since
it was the word of God, and this word is always effective and creative.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Now you see how all creatures have been drawn from
nothingness; you also see with what goodness God reveals to us the result of
his works, and with what condescension he is proportioned to our weakness. And,
in fact, could we have known all these details of creation, if the Lord had not
deigned to reveal them to men by the mouth of his prophet? So today we know
what order God has observed in creation, we see the effects of his power, and
we admire that creative word which commands nothingness, and which gives being
to so many different creatures.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">4. And yet there are some fools who, after these fine
instructions, still dare to say they are incredulous, and who do not want to
acknowledge that God created the world! they say, some that chance has done
everything, and others that a pre-existing matter has produced everything. But
see how dangerous this illusion of the devil is, and how he abuses the
simplicity of those who let themselves be seduced! it is to preserve us from
such a misfortune that the holy prophet, inspired by the Holy Spirit, tells us
so exactly the whole of creation, so that we obviously know the order and we
know how each creature was produced. But God would not have had such a special
care for our salvation, and if he had not himself directed the language of his
prophet, he would have contented himself with saying: God created heaven and
earth, the sea and animals; and he would not have judged it necessary to
distinguish the days of creation, or to mark separately the works of each of
them. But to remove all excuses from ungrateful men blinded by their
prejudices, Moses clearly distinguishes the order of facts and the number of
days; and he instructs us so carefully that it is impossible for us to
disregard the truth, and to fall into the error of the Gentiles. They only
utter the dreams of their imagination, while we know how great and powerful the
Lord our God is.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">He said, Let the waters produce living creatures that
swim in the water, and birds flying on the earth, under the firmament of
heaven; and suddenly the element, docile to the Word of the Creator, fulfills
its command. So Moses adds: And it was done according as God had commanded. And
God created the great fishes, and all the animals that have life and motion,
that the waters produced each one according to his kind; and he also created
birds, each according to his kind. And God saw that it was good; and he blessed
them, saying, Grow and multiply, fill the sea, and let the birds multiply on
the earth. (Gen. I, 21, 22.) Consider, I pray you, what is the wisdom of the
Holy Spirit. Moses had already said, and it was done so; and here he inspires
him to reveal to us all the details of this work. And God created the great
fishes, and all the animals that have life and motion, that the waters produce
each one according to his kind; and he also created birds, each according to
his kind; and God saw that it was good. These words again repress a reckless critic.
And indeed, so that no one can say: why sea monsters? what is their usefulness,
and what advantages can man derive from their creation? Moses first tells us
that God created, with the big fish, all the animals that have life and
movement, as well as the birds; and then he adds: God saw that it was good.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">It is as if he were telling us: because you do not
know the reason for divine works, do not hurry to blame the Creator. You have
heard the word of the Lord, which proclaims that they are good; and, full of a
mad recklessness, you dare to ask why they exist, as if they were in the
creation only a superfluity? And yet if you had a righteous sense, they would
show you the power and the ineffable goodness of the Lord. Its power appears in
that it has sufficed for a word and a command. to produce these sea monsters,
and his goodness in that after having created them, he has relegated them to
the vast abyss of the ocean, so that they can not harm the man. Thus these
giants of the seas make us admire the overpowering power of the Creator, and
they are harmless. Is not this double utility a great proof of divine goodness,
since the sight of these monsters leads every wise spirit to the knowledge of
the Lord, and which, by a prodigy of benevolence, prevents them from us? to do
no harm? For all creatures have not been produced for the sole benefit of man;
and some are intended to publish the magnificence of the Creator. Yes, some
have been made for our use, and others to manifest the greatness of God, and to
proclaim His power. So when you hear the sacred writer telling you that God saw
that all this was good, (39) do not have the temerity to contradict the
Scripture, nor to curiously emit this imprudent word: why did God does this or
that creature? And God blessed them, saying, Grow and multiply, fill the sea;
and that birds multiply on the earth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">5. The effect of this blessing has been the prodigious
growth of fish and birds. And because God wanted them to be perpetuated in
their generations, He blessed them, saying, Grow and multiply. It is thus that
they have been preserved till today, and that through so many ages no species
has perished. For by the blessing of God, and by this word: Grow and multiply,
they have been given to multiply and to subsist forever. And in the evening and
in the morning was the fifth day. Scripture thus teaches us which species among
animals were created on the fifth day. But wait a little, and you will see the
goodness of the Lord burst again. For he not only made the waters fecund to produce
fish and birds, but he also commanded the earth to give birth to terrestrial
animals. This is why the continuation of the narrative commits us to addressing
the work of the sixth day.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God said, Let the earth produce living creatures,
every man after his kind: the domestic animals, the reptiles, and the wild
beasts of the earth according to their different kinds. And this was so. (Gen.
I, 24.) Consider then what new service makes us earth, and how it obeys this
second order of the Lord. At first she had produced the seeds of all plants,
and now she gives birth to living animals, quadrupeds and reptiles, domestic
animals, and wild beasts. But here is confirmed what I had already told you,
namely, that in the works of creation, the Lord offered us our utility and
sometimes his own glory: he wanted the sight of so many creatures to make us to
admire the power of the Creator, and to reveal to us that his infinite goodness
and wisdom made them for man, whom he was soon to create.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">God made the beasts of the earth according to their
kind; domestic animals and all those who crawl on the earth, each according to.
his kind. And he saw that it was good. (Gen. I, 25.) Where are today those who
dare to ask why God created wild beasts and dangerous reptiles? Let them hear
this word of Scripture: And God saw that it was good. What! the Creator Himself
praises His work, and you would dare to blame it! But is not this an extreme
madness? All the trees that the earth nourishes do not produce fruit, and we
count among them wild and barren species; all the plants themselves are not
useful: there are some who are unknown to us, and others who are evil. And yet
who would dare to condemn them? for they were not created by chance and without
intention. Yes, they would not have been praised by the Creator himself, if
they should have been entirely useless. In addition to the fruit trees, we
possess a large number of them which, although sterile, are as useful as the
first, because they serve the different uses of life and the needs of man. And,
indeed, we employ them either in the construction of buildings, or in the
making of necessary and convenient furniture. Thus, no creature has been made
without reason, although the mind of man can not discover all its utility. But
what I say about trees also applies to animals, some of which are used for our
food, and others for our work. It is not even ferocious beasts and reptiles
that are not useful to us; and although since the disobedience of our first
parents we have lost the empire and authority over them, whoever thinks of it
seriously will convince himself that we still derive valuable benefits from it.
And, indeed, the doctors draw several remedies for the cure of our diseases.
Besides, how could the creation of ferocious animals be blameworthy, since
they, like domestic animals, had to submit to the man whom God was about to
create? And that's what I'm talking about.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">6. But first, let us consider as a whole the goodness
of the Lord with regard to man. He stretched out the heavens, created the
earth, and placed the firmament to divide the upper waters from the lower
waters; he then joins the waters in a basin which he calls sea; he called the
arid element earth, and adorned it with trees and plants; he then passed to the
formation of these two great bodies of light, and of that multitude of stars
which embellish the sky; finally, he completed the work of the fifth day by
commanding the waters to produce the (40) fish that swim in their bosom, and
the birds that fly on the earth, below the firmament. But because it was
fitting that the earth itself was populated, it created the various animals,
both those who serve our food and those who help us in our labors, and even
reptiles and ferocious beasts. Thus God, after having produced all creatures,
each in his rank and perfection, set the universe as a great table loaded with
all kinds of dishes and resplendent with princely luxury and truly royal
magnificence. . It was then that he created the man, who was to enjoy all these
riches. He gave him authority over all visible creation; and, to show how much
he surpassed all other creatures in dignity, he submitted them to his empire
and his power.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But, in order not to prolong this discourse beyond
measure, I leave to-morrow all that concerns the admirable formation of man,
this being gifted with life and reason, and I ascend, as usual, by a moral
instruction . So remember. faithfully my words, that the sight of creatures may
excite you to glorify the Creator. No doubt we can neither penetrate the divine
secrets nor understand all the wonders of creation; but even this impotence,
far from being an occasion of unbelief, must animate us more to celebrate the
glory of the Lord. The weakness of our reason and the smallness of our mind can
only increase in us the idea of ​​divine greatness, and the power of the
Creator seems all the more sovereign to us as his works are incomprehensible to
us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">This acknowledgment is at the same time the testimony
of a grateful heart and a wise mind. But the good ones went astray because they
allowed everything to their thoughts; they have not sufficiently known the
weakness of our reason, and, wishing to penetrate mysteries impenetrable to
man, they have crossed the limits of the possible and have degraded themselves.
Thus, endowed with reason, and by this admirable prerogative raised above all
visible creatures, they fell into such absurdity, that they adored the dog, the
monkey, the crocodile, and other animals. more despicable still. Eh! what do I
speak of brutes and animals! Who knows that people have been stupid and foolish
enough to worship onions and vegetables? These are the people designated by the
Prophet when he said: "The man has been likened to the beasts that have no
reason, and he has become like them." (Ps. XLVIII, 21.) How has man,
endowed with reason and adorned with wisdom, become like the brute? and even
how did he come down below her? The animal can not be responsible for this
monstrous idolatry, since it is an unreasonable being; but the man who falls
into this excess of impiety will be rigorously punished, because after so many
benefits, he can only be hell. The Gentiles called the gods stone and wood, and
they made the coarsest elements into deities; for from the day they departed
from the path of truth, they rushed into a deep abyss of malice and impiety.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">7. However, we must not despair of their salvation,
and we must instruct them in all charity and in all patience. Let us show them
and the absurdity of idolatry, and the misfortunes to which they expose
themselves; but above all, never stop working on their conversion. It is
probable, indeed, that with time we will bring them to the truth, especially if
our conduct is not an occasion or an excuse for them to depart from it. For
many among the heathen, seeing that we, who call us Christians, are like them,
greedy, avaricious and envious, vindictive, traitors, dissolute and voluptuous,
many, I say, repel our opinions, persuade themselves that our religion is only
a deception, and think that all Christians are guilty of the same vices.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Consider seriously, I implore you, what tortures. who
are worthy to make themselves worthy of the eternal fires of hell, and cause a
great number of pagans to persevere in their errors. They close the ear to the
voice of truth; but the former give them an occasion to calumniate virtue, and,
what is a great sin, to blaspheme the holy name of God. Understand, then, the
fatal consequences of scandal: those who spread it do not expose themselves to
vulgar punishment; but they prepare for themselves the most frightful torments,
since they will be punished, and for their own sins, and for those whom they
have done, either by keeping the pagans in idolatry, or by authorizing them
(41) to suspect the virtue of good people, and to continue their blasphemies
against the Lord.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Penetrated by these truths, let us not neglect our
salvation, but let us apply ourselves to live according to the maxims of the
Gospel, for we can not ignore that they will be for us a subject of
condemnation, or a title to the most magnificent rewards. Let us conduct
ourselves so cautiously that our conscience does not reproach us, that our good
examples bring to the truth, by sweet insinuations, those who are in error, and
that all our brothers enjoy all esteem. that their virtues deserve. But above
all, let us take care that the Lord be glorified, so that he himself redoubles
his paternal care towards us. And indeed, when our edifying conduct encourages
the neighbor to virtue and animates him to praise God, we obtain more abundant
graces. Hey! Is he not truly happy, who can not be seen without admiration and
exclaiming: glory be restored to you, Lord? What men are these Christians! what
wisdom shines in them, and what detachment from the goods of the earth! they
look upon them as a shadow and a dream; and, indifferent to all that passes,
they live as travelers on a foreign land, and eagerly wish to leave life. But what
divine favors, even here below, do not attract these discourses on those who
give occasion! And, new prodigy no less admirable, the pagans who express
themselves thus do not delay in recognizing their errors and returning to the
truth. But who does not understand how much the assurance of our salvation then
increases! Since we will be judged on the good or the bad that we will have
done to our brothers by our examples, let us regulate our life so that we have
nothing to reproach ourselves and that the neighbor is edified. Thus, on earth,
we shall deserve the abundance of divine grace, and that in heaven we will
greatly enjoy eternal rewards, by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ, the only
begotten of the Father, to whom, with Father and the Holy Spirit, glory, honor,
and empire, now and for ever and ever. So be it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

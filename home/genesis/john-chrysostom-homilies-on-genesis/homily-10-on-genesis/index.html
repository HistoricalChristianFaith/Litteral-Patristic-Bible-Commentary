people who, unable to temper their meals, could not dare to come to church
until evening; and he warns them that the essential is not so much to endure
all the rigor of fasting as to abstain from sin. 2. Nothing, then, should
prevent them from coming to hear the holy word, and so give their souls the
nourishment they need. - 3-6. He then goes on to explain these words: "God
made man in his own image," and after briefly recalling what he had already
said, he explains the meaning of these: "He created them male and female,
"and describes the prodigious effects of the blessing which the Lord gave
them. 7 As to what the sacred writer says: "God rested on the seventh
day," that does not imply any contradiction with this word of Jesus
Christ: "let his Father cease to act." Moses only affirms that God
did not produce other creatures, and Jesus Christ speaks of the care by which
God governs and preserves all things. He finishes by exhorting his hearers to
communicate to their absent brethren the doctrine they have heard, and to
preserve for themselves a faithful memory.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

competition of my listeners has diminished: duel is the motive and the cause?
Perhaps some have feared, after taking it. nourishment of the body, to come
here to seek that of the soul, and that is the reason for their absence .. But
I want to remind them of this saying of the Wise One: There is a shame that
brings sin, and there is a shame which attracts glory and grace. (Ecclesiastes
IV, 25.) Now, how can one who first sits down at a crude and material table,
and then comes to take part in this spiritual feast, blush? For the exercises
of piety are not, like human affairs, subject to set times: they can be done at
any time of the day. What do I say, of the day? night itself is not an obstacle
to the diffusion of holy doctrine. So the Apostle wrote to Timothy,
"Announce the word; press men in time and against time; take back, beg,
threaten. (II Tim IV, 2.) We also learn from St. Luke that Paul being in Troas,
and having to leave the next day, spoke to the disciples and entertained them
until the middle of the night. (Act XX, 7.) You see well that the hour,
although advanced, did not stop the Apostle and did not prevent him from
preaching the Gospel. Let us understand, therefore, that an attentive and
vigilant listener is worthy to sit at this spiritual meeting, although he is
out of the woods, and that, on the contrary, even if he is still fasting, he will
not derive any profit from it if he is cowardly and sleepy.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">I speak thus not to depreciate the rigor of fasting:
do not please! for I praise and approve those who observe all the severity of
it, but I want to teach you that we must bring to the spiritual exercises a
sober and vigilant spirit, and not appear there purely by habit. There is no
shame in first taking one's food and then coming to attend our meetings; but it
is shameful to wear a cowardly and distracted mind and a heart troubled by
passions and enslaved to the attractions of the flesh. What harm is there to
eat? no; excess alone is criminal, and we must condemn those who take beyond
what is necessary and think only of satiating their belly. The least
inconvenience that results is to blunt in them the enjoyment of taste. So again
there is no sin in the moderate use of wine, but one can not blame too much
drunkenness that goes so far as to disturb reason. The weakness of your
temperament prevents you, my dear brother, from prolonging your fast until the
evening, what sensible man can make you a crime! For the Master whom we serve
is good and (53) indulgent, and he requires nothing above our strength. It is
not, therefore, precisely abstinence and fasting that he asks of us, and he is
not satisfied, for that reason, that we differ from our meal until evening. But
he wants that, less applied to the affairs of the earth, we give more care to
those of our souls. For if all our life was spent in the practice of Christian
temperance, and if we allowed the exercises of piety all our leisure; if we
only took the absolutely necessary food, and if we spent all our days in a
series of good works, we would have no need of fasting. But man is naturally
cowardly and negligent; he delights in pleasure and he seeks softness. So, the
Lord, like a good father who loves his children, has instituted the salutary
correction of fasting. This is how it cuts short all our delicacies; so that it
is easy for us to devote to piety the time taken from the preoccupations of the
earth. If some of them can not, by weakness of temperament, observe the fast in
all its rigor, I exhort them to grant a necessary relief, and especially not to
miss our meetings. Because, coming here after their meal, they will only be
better disposed and more attentive.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">2. And, besides abstinence and fasting, there are
other ways which surely lead us to God. Thus, whoever is obliged to advance the
hour of his meal, compensates for this infraction of the law of fasting by more
abundant alms, more fervent prayers, and more zeal to listen to the holy word.
The weakness of temperament can not be an excuse here. I ask him again to be
reconciled to his enemies and to banish from his heart any feeling of hatred.
The practice of these virtues is that true and sincere fast that the Lord
requires. For he prescribes abstinence only as a means of repressing the
passions of the flesh, and submitting it to the spirit, which will itself
become more obedient to the divine law. If we neglect the useful help of
fasting, under the specious pretext of a bad health, but in reality cowardice,
we are fools and we expose ourselves to serious damage. For since fasting is of
no use without the practice of other virtues, how many will we not be guilty,
if, not being able to use the support of fasting, we abandon besides the
exercise of good works.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

can do it with all the zeal and fervor you are capable of. For as much as the
outer man is destroyed in us, the interior is renewed. (II Cor IV, 16.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And indeed, fasting weakens the body and represses the
movements of concupiscence, it purifies the soul and gives it as wings to rush
to heaven. As for those of your brothers whom bad health prevents from fasting,
exhort them not to deprive us of our spiritual feasts, and by telling them my
words, tell them that the one who drinks and eats moderately is not it is
unworthy to take place in this enclosure, and it is closed only to cowardly and
intemperate listeners. It will also be helpful to remind them of this word of
the Apostle: He who eats, does it for the Lord; and he who abstains, does so in
the sight of the Lord, and gives thanks to God. (Romans XIV, 6.) Fast, bless
the Lord who gives you the strength to sustain the rigors of fasting; are you
obliged to anticipate your meal, bless, and you also the Lord, because if you
will, this infraction of the law will not be harmful to you, and it will not
bring any prejudice to the salvation of your soul. For it is impossible to
count all the ways which the goodness of the Lord opens to us and which directs
our good will towards him. In speaking thus, I have in mind the absent ones,
and I propose to deprive them of all pretense of shame. Because, know it well,
there is nothing in their conduct which must make them blush. One must blush
only of sin, and not to have taken some food.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Sin alone deserves shame; and when we have committed
it, we are right to blush and hide ourselves. We ought then not to consider
ourselves less unhappy than those who have been shipwrecked, and yet not to
lose heart. We must only hasten to resort to repentance and confession. And
indeed, when we have sinned out of weakness, the Lord our God requires nothing
but that we confess our faults and that we make a firm statement not to fall
back. But we have no reason to blush when we eat moderately. For it is God (54)
who has given us our body: and to sustain himself, this body needs food. The
essential thing is not to give it too much; Moreover, Christian sobriety is the
best way to keep it healthy and in good condition. Hey! do not you see every
day that a delicate table and a gluttonous intemperance generate an infinity of
diseases? Where do we get gout, migraine, plenty of moods and a thousand other
diseases? Is it not intemperance and drunkenness? The ship that is watering
from all sides, suddenly sinks. Thus the reason of man drowns in the excess of
wine and meat. So this man is no more than a living corpse. He can still do
evil, but he is too. unable to do good unless he was really dead.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

satisfy the desires of the flesh. (Rom XIII, 14.) But be always able to apply
yourself with ardor to the exercises of piety. Say well to your brothers and
persuade them not to deprive themselves of your spiritual feasts; as they
hasten to seek here, even after their meal, that holy food which will
strengthen them against the attacks of the devil. As for me, I will continue to
serve her every evening, to reward your kind attention, and fulfill my promise.
You have certainly not forgotten that I had begun to speak to you of the
training of the man, and that, pressed by the hour, I could only indicate the
utility which he drew from the service of the animals. I have also proved that
his disobedience alone made him lose the empire he had first possessed. Today I
will finish this subject and then send you back.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But to make my word more intelligible, it is useful to
begin this conversation by recalling the end of the preceding and completing
it. So I explained to you these verses of Genesis: And God said, Let us make
man in our image and likeness, and let them rule over the fishes of the sea and
the birds of the sky. This matter is so vast and gives me such an abundance of
thoughts that it was impossible for me to ignore it. So I stopped at this
passage, without touching the one immediately following. This is why it is
necessary to read it again, so that you can better understand its development.
Now the Scripture adds: And God created man; he created it in the image of God,
and he created it male and female. God blessed them, saying, Grow and multiply;
fill the earth, and subjugate it; control the fish of the sea, the birds of the
sky, the roofs of the animals, all the earth, and all the creeping reptiles on
the earth. (Gen. I, 27, 28.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">These words are short, but they contain a rich
treasure, and the divine spirit that spoke through the mouth of Moses, wants to
reveal to us great secrets. The Creator, after having said: Let us do man,
seems to recollect and take counsel as to show us the dignity of man in the
very act of his creation. For man did not exist yet; but already God revealed
all the eminence of the empire that he would give him: Therefore, having said,
Let us make man in our image and likeness, he adds, speaking in the plural,
that they dominate on the fishes of the sea. So see as from the beginning a rich
treasure is open to us! The holy prophet, enlightened by a divine light, speaks
of a fact not yet existing, as if it were realized. For why here this word in
the singular, let us do man, and there this word in the plural, which they
dominate? Obviously, there is a secret and a mystery, and this way of speaking
indicates in advance the formation of the woman. Thus everything in our holy
Scriptures has its reason and its motive, and a word which seems to be random
contains a precious instruction.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">4. And do not be astonished, my dear brother, of this
language, for all the prophets speak of future events as if they were already
accomplished: they see in the spirit what must happen only in the course of
centuries, and they tell it as if it were realizing before their eyes. To
convince yourself of this, listen to this prophecy of the Savior's passion, a
prophecy that so many centuries in advance pronounced the holy King David. They
pierced my feet and my hands, and they divided my clothes. (Ps. XXI, 17, 19.)
He speaks of a future and distant event, as if already accomplished.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">This is how Moses first insinuates, under the veil of
enigma and mystery, the formation of the woman, when he says: that they
dominate over the fish of the sea. But soon he speaks about it. more clearly,
and he adds: and God created man; he created it in the image of God; he created
them male and female. And observe (55) here how carefully the sacred writer
repeats the same fact twice to better engrave it in the memory of his readers.
If this had not been his intention, he would have contented himself with
saying: and God created man. But he adds: He created it in his image.
Previously he had explained to us the meaning of this word image, and here he
repeats it on purpose, and he tells us: and God created it in his image. He
also wished to leave no excuse for excuses for those who attack the dogmas of
the Church; that is why he explained above the meaning of this word image,
which he means of the empire which man should exercise over all animals. But
let's continue the story of Genesis. And God created man; he created it in the
image of God; he created them male and female. What he had previously
insinuated, by saying in the plural: that they dominate, Moses announces it
here more clearly, and yet still under the veil of mystery, because he did not
speak of the formation of the woman, and he did not indicate where she was
drawn from. So he is content to say, and God created them male and female.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The woman has not yet been formed, and already Moses
speaks of it as a fait accompli. This is the privilege of the spiritual vision;
and the eyes of the body have less force to seize sensible objects than those
of the soul to fix persons and facts that do not yet exist. After saying that
God created them male and female, Moses records in these terms the common
blessing that God gave them. And the Lord, he says, blessed them, saying, Grow
and multiply; Fill the earth, and subjugate it, and rule over the fishes of the
sea. What an eminent blessing! This order: grow, multiply, and fill the earth
had been intimated, it is true, to animals and reptiles; but it has been said
that the man and the woman command and dominate. Admire, then, the goodness of
the Lord! The woman does not yet exist, and it makes her enter into the
participation of the authority of the man, and the privileges of the divine
blessing. Dominate, he said to them, on the fishes of the sea, and on the birds
of the sky, and on all the animals, and on all the earth, and on all the
reptiles that move on the earth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">5. But who could measure the extent of this power, and
appreciate the grandeur of this empire! Hey! do you not see that all creation
has been subject to the scepter of man? So you must not have this reasonable
animal any small and mediocre idea. For his honors are great, the goodness of
the Lord to him is immense, and his benefits as amazing as they are
unspeakable. And God said, Behold, I have given you all the plants scattered on
the face of the earth, and which bear their seed, and all the fruit-trees,
which have their seed in themselves, to serve your food. And it was done so.
(Gen. XXIX, 30.) Consider, my dear brothers, the sovereign goodness of the
Lord, carefully weigh the words of Scripture, and do not lose a syllable. And
God says, lo, I have given you all plants. He continues thus to address the man
and the woman, although this one has not yet been formed. Admire, too, the
excellence of this kindness which shows itself to be eminently liberal and
generous not only to man, and to the woman who did not exist, but also to all
animals. Because after having. Saying, I have given you the plants of the earth
to serve your food, and the Lord adds: and to all the animals of the earth.
Here is another abyss of goodness, since the same God who provides for the
needs of the animals who serve our needs, our labors, and our food, does not
exclude wild and ferocious animals.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Hey! who would speak worthily of this infinite
goodness! Behold, says the Lord, that all plants will serve your food, and that
of all the animals of the earth, of all the birds of the sky, and. of all the
reptiles that crawl on the earth, and all that is alive and animated. (Gen. I,
30.) These words show us the paternal providence of the Lord with regard to the
man whom he has just created. For after having created him, he gives him a
sovereign power over all animals, and lest he be frightened at the sight of so
great a multitude that he would have to feed, he warns even . thought of this
worry, and tells him. that he ordered the land to provide, by its fertility,
for its food and that of all animals. So, he says, these plants will serve your
food, and that of all the animals of the earth, and the birds of the sky, and
the creeping reptiles on the earth, and all that is alive and animated . And it
was done so. Now all the commandments of the Lord were immediately executed,
and all the creatures were disposed in the rank and order that had been
assigned to them. It is (56) why Moses immediately adds: and God saw all his
works, and they were very good.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">6. We can not praise enough the accuracy of the Holy
Scripture. For by this word alone: ​​and God lives all his works, she closes
her mouth to all the contradictors. God saw all his works, and they were very
good: and in the evening and in the morning was the sixth day. Moses said after
every particular creation: and God saw that it was good. But. when the whole of
creation was finished, and the work of the sixth day completed by the formation
of, the man for whom the universe was made, he observes that God saw all his
works, and that they were very -good. This word all his works includes the
universality of creatures, and encloses them all in the same eulogy. And
observe that here Moses expressly says all the works of God, and not only all
things; just as he does not say that they were good, but very good, that is,
they were eminently good. But since the Lord, who has drawn all creatures from
nothingness, finds them very good, and eminently good, what is the fool who
dares to open his mouth to contradict him!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">It is he who among the visible creatures has created
the light and the darkness, which are opposed to him, the day and the night
which is the negation. It was he who commanded the land to produce beneficial
plants and poisonous herbs, fruit trees, and barren trees, sweet and familiar
animals, and wild and feral animals. It was he who peopled the waters of the smallest
fish, no less than whales and sea monsters, which rendered some parts of the
earth habitable, and others inhospitable; who spread the plains, and who raised
the hills and the mountains; it is he who among the birds has created the
domestic species which serve our food, and the wild and filthy species, like
the vulture and the kite; and among the terrestrial animals he has produced and
those who are useful to us, and those who are harmful to us, the serpents, the
vipers and the dragons, the lions and the leopards. Finally it is he who, in
the regions of the atmosphere, also gives birth to the rain and the beneficial
winds, the snow and the hail. Thus, in going through the entire order of
creation, we always find the bad beside the good, and yet we are not allowed to
blame any creature, and to say: why such a creature , and for what purpose?
This is well done, and it is badly done. For Scripture warns and represses all
these criticisms by saying that at the end of the sixth day, God having
completed creation, lives all his works, and that they were very good.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">What reasoning, I ask you, could counterbalance a
testimony of such authority? For it is the Creator himself who states his
appreciation and declares that all his works are good and very good. So when
you hear someone blame the creation, and rise up against the Holy Scripture,
flee him like a fool; or rather, do not run away from him, but take pity on his
ignorance, and quote to him the words of our holy books: God saw all his works,
and they were very good. Perhaps you will be able to correct the indiscretion
of his language. For in human affairs we refer to the opinion of wise and wise
men, so that, far from contradicting them, we subscribe to their judgment, and
subject them to our own enlightenment. But all the more must we do so with God,
Creator of the universe. As soon as he has spoken, all that remains is to
repress all criticism and to keep quiet; for it is enough for us to know and to
be certain, to adorn his wisdom and goodness, to preside over all his works,
and that nothing in creation has been done without reason and without motive.
Doubtless our intelligence is too feeble for us to penetrate the utility of
every creature, and yet there is not one that is not the work of infinite
wisdom and ineffable goodness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

day: and as on that day God ceased to produce new creatures, so says Moses,
Thus were the heavens, the earth, and all their ornaments finished. (Gen. II,
1.) What simplicity in these words! and as the Holy Scripture cuts off all vain
and superfluous expression! It confines itself to stating that the whole of the
creation was finished on the sixth day, and without repeating minute details,
it contented itself with saying that heaven and earth were finished with all
their ornaments; that is to say with all that they contain. Now, the ornaments
of the earth are its various productions, the (57) plants, the harvests, the
fruit trees, and all the riches of which the Lord has deigned to embellish it.
The ornaments of the sky are the sun, there moon, the variety of stars, and all
the intermediate creatures. This is why Scripture here mentions only heaven and
earth, because under these two elements it understands the whole of creation.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God finished the sixth day all his work. The
sacred writer repeats it here so that we know that the creation was fully
accomplished in this space of six days. On the sixth day God completed all his
work, and rested the seventh of all the works he had made. What does it mean
that God rested on the seventh day from all the works he had done? Evidently
the Scripture expresses itself in a human way, and is proportionate to our
weakness. Without this condescension, it would have been impossible for us to
understand his thought. "And God," said she, "rested on the
seventh day from all the works which he had made: that is to say, he stopped in
the work of creation, and ceased to to draw new creatures from nothingness. And
indeed, he had produced all and every creature, and he had formed the man who
was to enjoy it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified him,
because he had rested on that day from all the works that he had made. The Lord
therefore ceased to create, because in the space of six days he had produced
all the creatures to which his goodness destined existence. He rested on the
seventh day, not wanting to create anything; for according to his designs the
work of creation was finished. But in order that this seventh day should also
have some prerogative, and that he should not be inferior to other days, since
he was not to enlighten any new production, he deigned to bless him. And God,
says the Scripture, blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. What ! Had not
the other six days been blessed? No doubt they had been, since in each of them
the Lord had produced different orders of creatures. This is why Scripture does
not say. not expressly that God blessed them, while she mentions here the
blessing of the seventh day. And he sanctified it, she said again. What does
this word mean: and he sanctified it? He tells us that God distinguished this
day from all others; and Scripture tells us the reason, when it adds, "May
God sanctify the seventh day, because in that day he rested from all the works
that he had made.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><br /></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Thus from the beginning a great mystery is revealed to
us, and we learn to sanctify a day of the week by devoting it to the exercises
of piety. This rest of the seventh day reminds us that God deigned to bless him
after having completed in six days the whole of creation, and that he
sanctified it because in that day he had rested from all the works he had made.
. But here thoughts are rushing, and I reproach myself for not communicating
them to you. Camelles seems to me rich, and I want to share with you their
wealth. And first, here is a first question. In Genesis, Moses tells us that
God rested from His works, and in the Gospel Jesus Christ tells us: My Father
always works, and so do I. (Gen. V, 17.) Does it not seem, at first glance,
that there is here an obvious contradiction? But God forbid that Scripture be
opposed to Scripture! when she tells us in Genesis that God rested from the
works he had made, she teaches us that on the seventh day he ceased to create,
and to draw new creatures from nothingness. When, on the contrary, Jesus Christ
says to us: My Father always works, and so do I; he manifests to us the
incessant action of Providence; and he calls action, or operation, that care
which directs the universe, maintains it, and preserves it. Hey! how would it
remain if the hand of the Lord ceased for a moment to sustain and lead men,
animals, and the elements! For the rest, it suffices to reflect seriously on
the blessings with which the Creator fills us every day, to recognize how
immense is the abyss of his mercies. And to quote only one trait, what word and
thought could express this ineffable kindness which, always generous to man,
makes his sun shine on the good and on the wicked, which rains on the just and
sinners, and who supplies abundantly to all their needs.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Perhaps this speech is prolonged beyond measure? And
yet it seems to me that it is not useless. For the absent will know better the
harm they do to themselves, by depriving themselves, by condescension for the
body, of the graces of this spiritual feast. But your (58) benevolent will
soften this deprivation, if it reports them this interview. It will even be
from you a sincere witness of charity. For if a friend likes to share his table
with his friends, how much better is it to share with them the joys of these
spiritual feasts! We ourselves will find a great profit, since the zeal that
leads us to educate our brothers, is useful to them, and also becomes for us a
title to the most beautiful rewards. We thus make a double profit. For God will
take into account our charity, and then by instructing others, we engrave more
deeply in our mind the memory of the lessons we have heard.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">8. Do not therefore deny your brothers a service from
which you will derive such great benefits, and repeat to them the instructions
of this evening. But so that they do not always be indebted for this benefit,
bring them here, and tell them their good that to have anticipated the time of
the meal is not a reason, to abstain from our conferences. For all times are
clean to instruct us. And indeed, which prevents us, in the interior of our
houses, before, or after our meals, to take in hand the holy Scriptures, and to
give to our soul a good and useful food. For if the body requires material
food, the soul also needs daily spiritual nourishment that strengthens it, and
allows it to resist the attacks of the flesh. Otherwise we would succumb to
this war which the enemies of our salvation declare to us, and they would
reduce our souls to a sad slavery, if we for a moment ceased to be strong and
vigilant. This is why the Psalmist calls the just man who meditates day and
night the law of the Lord; and Moses recommends to the Jews that after drinking
and eating, and being satisfied, they remember the Lord, their God. (Ps 1, 2
... Deut, VIII, 10).</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">You see, then, how useful it is to give our souls
spiritual nourishment; after granting the body the one he claims. Otherwise the
body would be kept fresh and refreshed, and the weakened and languid soul would
fall, and succumb to the attacks of the devil. Because this one spies every
opportunity to train us to the mortal sin. That's why the same Moses gives us
this advice: Before you sleep and wake up, remember the Lord your God. (Deut,
VI, 7.) Thus this memory must never fade from our memory, but we must always be
present, and establish ourselves in continual vigilance. We must also keep
ourselves constantly on our guard, because we can not ignore how great is the
fury of our enemy. It is therefore necessary that we are always attentive and
vigilant to close to him any entrance, and to give each day to our soul its
spiritual food. This is a sure means of salvation, and a treasure of heavenly
riches. If every day we strengthen ourselves thus by reading, by hearing the
holy word and by pious conversations, we will become invincible to the attacks
of the devil, we will avoid his traps, and we will obtain the kingdom of
heaven, by grace and goodness. Our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, glory, honor, and empire, now and always, and for
ever and ever. So be it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

our first parents should make us attentive and vigilant to avoid sin, and then
he explains why Adam gave his wife the name of Eve. - 2.-3. The garments of
skins of which the Lord clothed them, testify his kindness, and warn us to
avoid the luxury and sumptuousness of the garments. - The speaker takes the
opportunity of a severe lesson to the rich, then he explains, as an ironical
fulfillment of the promises of the devil, this saying: "Here Adam is like
one of us. It was also by a merciful effect that God chased Adam out of the
earthly paradise, before he had eaten the fruit of the tree of life; because
immortality would have led him always to sin. He also compelled her to live
with the earthly paradise, so that the sight of this place might remind her of
her fault, and he subjected her to hard work so that he would not become too attached
to the earth. life. 4. With regard to these words: "Adam knew his
wife," St. Chrysostom observes that virginity was the first state of Adam
and Eve, and he points out its excellence. 5. Then he says that, if God
accepted the gifts of Abel, and rejected those of Cain, it was because of their
inner dispositions, and he dwelled at length on the kindness with which the
Lord spoke to Cain, and sought inspire him with better feelings. 6. Finally he
concludes with a few words on the care that we must have to flee from the sin
into which Cain fell.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">1. Yesterday, you have been able to appreciate the
indulgence of the superior judge, and the benevolence of his words. You have
also seen the variety of punishment inflicted on the guilty. Thus the tempter
was punished quite differently than those whom he had seduced; and divine mercy
burst forth eminently even in the sentence passed against our first parents. It
was therefore useful for us to attend this solemn judgment, and to follow all
the details. For we have known from what good things Adam and Eve have deprived
themselves by their disobedience; and we have learned how sin has robbed them
of glory. all heavenly and of a very angelic existence. Finally, we have
admired the patience of the Lord, and we have understood what a great evil is
weakness since it has resulted in the loss of such precious benefits for man,
and has plunged him into a humiliating degradation. That is why I beseech you,
let us watch over ourselves, that this fall may be a salutary warning to us,
and that this punishment will keep us in a wise distrust. We will be punished
very severely, if this terrible example does not deter us from offending God.
For every sin of relapse deserves to be punished more rigorously. This is what
the illustrious doctor of the nations, Blessed Paul, tells us when he tells us
that all who have sinned without the law will perish without the law, and that
all who have sinned under the law will be judged. by the law. The meaning of
this passage is that those who have sinned before the evangelical law will be
treated with more indulgence than we who live under this law, and deserve more
rigorous punishment because we sin after to have received it. For all who sin
without the law shall perish without the law; and it will be an advantage to
them to punish them for not having received knowledge or the help of the law
... But all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law; because it
taught them, (106) says the Apostle, what they should do, and they did not want
to follow his prescriptions. So, for the same sins, they will be punished more
severely than the infidels.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But let us explain the passage just read. And Adam
gave his wife the name of Eve, which means life, because she is the mother of
all living. Observe here the care taken by the sacred writer to transmit these
details to us. Thus we learn that Adam gave a name to his wife, and that he
called her Eve, that is life, because she is the mother of all living. It is
indeed the stem of the human race and the root and principle of all
generations. But after telling us how Adam gave a name to his wife, Moses again
tells us of the goodness of God, who did not abandon his creatures in the
shameful nakedness in which they had fallen. And the Lord God, he said, gave Adam
and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them. The Lord then acts as a good
father behaves to a prodigal son. This son of a family was endowed with a good
naturalness and had been brought up with care. He enjoyed in the paternal house
a rich abundance, wore silk clothes, and had at his disposal an opulent
heritage. But now the very excess of prosperity hurls him into evil; and then
his father cuts off all these various advantages, keeps him more closely under
his control, and replaces his sumptuous clothes with a simple and common habit
which hides only his nakedness. So Adam and Eve went unworthy of that glorious
glory that covered them and freed them from all the needs of the body. God took
away from them this brilliance and the possession of all the goods they enjoyed
before that time. dreadful fall. However, he had compassion on so great a
misfortune, and seeing them ashamed of a nakedness which they could neither
cover nor hide, he made tunics of skin and clothed them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">So where are the artifices of the devil? As soon as we
listen to his suggestions, he seduces us with the love of some passing
pleasure, and draws us into the abyss of sin. Then he abandons us, all covered
with shame and confusion, to the pity and the eyes of all. But the Lord, who is
always interested in the salvation of our souls, did not turn away his eyes
from the sad state in which our first parents were reduced, and he gave them a
garment whose simplicity alone was a memory of their fall. And the Lord God
made Adam and his wife with tunics of skin, and clothed them. Observe here, I
ask you, with what condescension the Scripture is proportioned to our weakness.
But, I said it, and I repeat it, one must always give it a sense worthy of God.
Thus this word: God made tunics, must be taken in this sense that he commanded
that these tunics existed; and he wanted our first parents to cover them, so
that this garment would constantly remind them of their disobedience.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">2. Listen, O rich ones! O you who pride yourself on
the work of silkworms, and who adorn you with the most beautiful fabrics!
listen to this lesson of modesty that the Lord gave us from the first days of
creation. Man had deserved death by his sin, and he needed a garment to hide
his nakedness; and now God only puts on him a tunic of skin. He wanted to teach
us to flee a soft and voluptuous life, and to embrace preferably a hard and
austere life. But perhaps the rich, repelled by this severe morality, will tell
me what! do you want us to dress with animal skins? I do not say that; and our
first parents themselves have not always worn this kind of clothing, for divine
goodness never ceases to be generous and beneficent. Thus, from the day Adam
and Eve were subjected to the needs of nature, and lost the sweet and angelic
existence in which they were created, the Lord allowed them to weave the wool
to make clothing. It was proper, indeed, that man, being reasonable, should be
clothed, and that he should not live like an animal in shame and nakedness. Our
clothes thus remind us of the possessions we have lost, and the chastisement
which, by their disobedience, Adam and Eve, have attracted to all mankind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But how can one excuse this frenzied luxury which
rejects the use of wool, to wear nothing but silk, and which even drives
extravagance to embellish it with gold embroidery. It is mainly women who
indulge in these vanities; and I say to them: why do you parry your body? and
why do you (107) pride yourself on this pompous paraphernalia? So you forget
that the clothes are a continuation of the punishment inflicted on our first
parents. So the Apostle tells us: Having enough to feed ourselves and cover
ourselves with, we must be happy. (I Tim.6, 8.) Thus we must limit our
solicitude to the bare necessities; and it is enough for our body to be covered
without worrying about the beauty or variety of the clothes. But let's continue
the story of Genesis.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And the Lord God said, Behold Adam become like one of
us, knowing good and evil; now, therefore, let us fear that He will advance His
hand, and take also of the tree of life, and that He may eat and live forever.
And the Lord God put him out of the garden of delight, to cultivate the land
from which he had been drawn. (Gen. III, 22, 23.) Here again the Lord uses
expressions proportioned to our weakness: And the Lord God says: Behold Adam
become like one of us, knowing good and evil. What simplicity of language! but
let us understand it in a sense worthy of God. He reminds us, therefore, of how
the devil, by the organ of the serpent, deceived our first parents. He said to
them, "If you eat this fruit, you will be like gods; and they ate it in
the foolish hope of being equal to divinity. This is why God, wishing to make
them feel again the blemish of their fault, and the illusion of their hopes,
says ironically: "Behold Adam become like one of us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">This bitter reproach was personal and could only throw
Adam into extreme confusion. It is as if the Lord had said to him: You have
transgressed my commandment to be equal to me. Well! what you desired happened,
or rather what you did not want, but what you deserved. Because you have become
like one of us, knowing good and evil. The devil had said to Eve, by the
serpent's organ, "Your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods,
knowing good and evil. So the Lord added, "And now let us fear that he
should lift up his hand, and take from the tree of life, and eat and live
forever. Here again the divine mercy manifests itself; but we must deepen each
of these words to lose nothing, and discover all the hidden riches. When God
made a command to Adam, he allowed him the use of all the fruits, except for
one, threatening him with death, if he dared to touch it. But in commanding and
threatening him, he says nothing about the tree of life. Adam, created
immortal, could, in my opinion, and as far as I understand this passage, eat
the fruit of this tree, as of all the others; and so he could have ensured
immortality, since he had received no defense touching this tree.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">3. If I were curiously asked why this tree is called
the tree of life, I would say that human reason is incapable of understanding
all the works of God. We only know that it pleased the Lord that in the earthly
paradise man had as a matter of the virtue of obedience and the sin of
disobedience. That's why he planted these two trees, one of life and the other
of death, so to speak. For it was because he had eaten the fruit of the latter
against the command of God, that man was subjected to death. But from the
moment that he touched the forbidden fruit, sin entered the world, and man
became subject to death, and to all the infirmities of nature. Yet this death
was in the divine counsels a grace even more than a punishment; so the Lord
would not allow Adam to inhabit the earthly paradise. He drove him out of it,
proving to him, by this very rigor, that he acted only out of kindness and in
his interest. But this doctrine requires a deeper examination of this passage.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And now, says the Lord, let us fear that Adam advances
his hand, and takes also the fruit of the tree of life, and that he does not
eat and live forever. It is as if he had said: An excess of intemperance has
led man to transgress my command, and his sin has subjected him to death. So
today, if he dared to touch the fruit of the tree of life, he would acquire
immortality and never stop sinning. That is why it is to him that I chase him
from the earthly paradise; and I will give it rather a mark of goodness than
anger and revenge. Thus spoke the Lord; and it is true to say that his
chastisements, as well as his benefits, show his mercy. So this hard exile
became for Adam a salutary lesson. For if God had not foreseen that impunity
would make men more guilty, he would not have driven Adam out of earthly
paradise. (108) But it was to prevent the progress of vice in them and to close
the way to a mischief that could not stop, that he chastised Adam in a thought
of mercy; and this is what he does every day with regard to sinners.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">He therefore commanded, out of benevolence and
goodness, that man was driven out of the earthly paradise. And the Lord God,
says the Scripture, put Adam out of the garden of delight, to plow the land
from which he had been drawn. Notice here the accuracy of the sacred writer. He
tells us that the Lord God put Adam out of the garden of delights, to plow the
land from which he had been drawn. The divine judgment then receives its
execution, and the man, driven from the garden of delights, was forced to work
the land. Nor is it without reason that Scripture adds: from whence he had been
fired. For this work was to be for him a continual lesson of humility,
reminding him that his body had been formed of the mud of the earth. So it is
expressly said: That he should work the land from which he was drawn. It is
still like the consequence of this other word of the Lord: You will eat your
bread by the sweat of your brow, that Adam then received the order to work the
land from which he had been drawn.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Scripture then tells us how far from the earthly
paradise God establishes it, since it adds that the Lord God drove out Adam,
and made him live in front of the garden of delights. But here, as in all his
covers, God shows himself to be full of mercy, even when he chastises us. So it
is out of kindness and mercy that he casts Adam out of earthly paradise; and if
he then establishes it in the presence of this same residence, it is so that
each day he may conceive a new regret for his former state, and a new grief for
his present misfortunes. No doubt this view was very sad and bitter to him, and
yet he found there a useful lesson; for it made him wiser and more vigilant,
and prevented him from sinning. It is indeed all too common for man to abuse
the goods he enjoys, and to correct himself only when he has lost them. For
experience reveals to him his fault, and his misfortune makes him appreciate
the happiness from which he has fallen and feel the evils that surround him. It
was therefore on God's part a sign of providence and goodness to establish Adam
in the face of earthly paradise, since the sight of this place was to sustain
salutary remorse in him. Finally, to prevent him from becoming too attached to
life, he would try to return to the garden of delights and eat the fruit of the
tree of life, the Lord, according to the story of the Scripture, narrative
proportioned to our weakness, the Lord placed a cherub with a flaming sword
that was still moving, to keep the path of the tree of life.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The negligence of our first parents in observing the
divine commandment caused the Lord to guard the entrance to paradise so
carefully. And it is fair to observe that if his goodness and mercy had already
appeared when he banished Adam, they did not burst any less when he placed a
cherub with a flaming sword that kept moving to keep the entrance of the garden
of delights. It is not without reason also that it is said of this sword that
he was constantly agitating. For we understand by this that all the roads that
could lead to this garden were closed, and that this blazing sword defended all
approaches. But what memories he remembered, and what terror he inspired to
Adam!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">4. Now Adam knew Eve his wife. (Gen. IV, 1.) Notice
the precise date of this fact. It was only after their disobedience and their
exile that Adam and Eve traded together. Before, they lived like angels, and
they did not know the pleasures of the flesh. Ah! how could they have known
them, since they were not subject to the needs of the body! Thus, in the order
of time, virginity possesses the palm of the priority; but when the weakness of
man had introduced disobedience and sin, she withdrew, because the earth was no
longer worthy to possess; and then the law of concupiscence is established.
Understand then, my dear brother, what is the dignity of virginity? It is a
well-ascended and sublime virtue, and its possession is too much above human
power, that we may acquire it without a special succor from divine power. And,
indeed, Jesus Christ Himself declares to us that the virgins are in a mortal
body the emulators of the angels. The Sadducees questioned him one day surfa
resurrection and said to him: Master, there were among us seven brothers; and
the first having married a wife died, and having no children, he left his wife
to his brother. It was the same with the second, the third, and all until the
seventh. On the day of the resurrection, which of the seven will she be a
woman? because (109) all had her for wife. But Jesus Christ answered them, You
are in error, knowing neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the
day of resurrection men will not have wives, nor wives of husbands; but they
will be like angels. (Matthew XXII, 25-30.) Do you now understand that those
who, for love of Jesus Christ, embrace holy virginity, lead the life of angels
to the earth and in a mortal body? But the more this state is great and high,
and the brighter are the crowns, the more magnificent the rewards, and the more
abundant the goods which are promised to all who join in chastity the practice
of other virtues.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Now Adam knew his wife who conceived and bore Cain.
Sin had entered the world through the disobedience of our first parents, and
the divine judgment had put them to death. That is why the Lord, who watched
over the preservation of the human race, allowed it to spread through the union
of man and woman. And Eve said, I have possessed a man by the grace of God. Do
you see how the punishment inflicted on the woman made her better and more
reserved? For she does not attribute to the laws of nature the birth of this
child; but she brings it back to God and pays homage to it. Thus punishment has
been a useful lesson for Elf. For I have possessed a man, "said she,"
by the grace of God, and I owe it rather to his kindness than to nature.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And again she bore Abel, her brother. The birth of
this second son was the reward of his keen gratitude for that of the first. For
this is how the Lord deals with us; and when we thank him for a first benefit,
he pays our homage by new favors. Eve became a mother a second time, because in
the first she had recognized the hand of the Lord. Now this fertility, since
sin had subjected her to death, was a great consolation to her. So God wanted
from the beginning to diminish for our first parents the severity of
punishment, and to erase the image of death under the picture of new
generations. And, indeed, these generations that succeed one another, are an
emblem of immortality. And Abel, says the Scripture, was shepherd of sheep, and
Cain plowman. We learn that each of the two brothers exercised a different art;
one embraced pastoral life, and the other devoted himself to agriculture.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But it came long after that Cain offered the Lord a
sacrifice of the fruits of the earth. (Gen. IV, 3.) Observe here what lights
the Creator had spread in the consciousness of man. For who had revealed to
Cain the notion of sacrifice? The voice of his conscience; he therefore offered
the Lord a sacrifice of the productions of the earth, because he could not fail
to acknowledge that he should pay homage to him for the fruits of his labor. It
is not that God needed his sacrifices; but it was fitting that, receiving his
benefits, he should show him his gratitude. And indeed, God, self-sufficient
and not claiming anything from us, willfully, in his extreme goodness, will
humble himself to our poverty, and allow by interest for our salvation, that
the knowledge of its attributes are a school of virtues.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And Abel also offered the firstborn of his flock. It
is not without reason that in our previous interview I told you that God, who
does not accept anyone, probes the will and rewards the intention of the heart.
This remark finds here its correct application. That is why this passage of
Genesis deserves a profound examination, and it is necessary to stop there
seriously to understand well what is said of Cain and Abel. For there is
nothing useless in Scripture, and a syllable, even a letter, contains a rich
treasure, since we can always draw from it a moral sense. But what does she
tell us? And it came to pass, long after, that Cain offered to the Lord a
sacrifice of the fruits of the earth, and Abel also offered the firstborn of
his flock and the fat ones.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">5. A penetrating mind understands at a simple reading
the meaning of this passage. But I owe it to all, and the Gospel doctrine is
equally addressed to all; I will go into some explanations, so that you will be
better educated. Cain, says the Scripture, offered the Lord a sacrifice of the
fruits of the earth. As for Abel, he chooses the productions of pastoral art as
his own. And he offered the firstborn of his flock and the fat ones. Already
these words alone show us all the piety of Abel, for he does not offer only a
few sheep taken at random from his flock, but the firstborn, that is to say,
the most beautiful and the most precious; and even among them the (110) fatter,
that is to say all that was better and more excellent. But with regard to Cain,
Scripture does not enter into any detail; she contented herself with telling us
that he offered a sacrifice of the fruits of the earth, and thus lets us
suppose that he took the first that fell to her hand, and that he disdained to
choose the most beautiful.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">I have already said it, and I will not cease to repeat
it. If God receives our sacrifices, it is not that He needs them. He only wants
to facilitate the means to show him our gratitude. That is why the man who
offers in sacrifice the very things that he holds of God, must, to fulfill this
religious duty, choose all that he has of the best. Otherwise, he would not
understand how much God is superior to him and how much he is honored to
fulfill these priestly functions. Observe also, my dear brother, and conclude
from this example what rigorous chastisement deserves the Christian who, by
cowardice, neglects his salvation. I add that no doctor instructed Cain and
Abel, and that no counselor suggested to them the idea of ​​offering a
sacrifice: their conscience alone warned them, and the lights which the Lord
had spread in the spirit of the man. It was also the purity of the intention
which made acceptable the sacrifice of the one and the malice of the will which
made reject that of the other.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God, says the scripture, looked at Abel and his
gifts. Do you see how this word of the Gospel is fulfilled here: the first will
be the last and the last will be first? (Xxi., 30.) For whoever had the
privilege of the birthright, and who first offered his sacrifice, was put under
his brother, because his intention was not right. Both offered a sacrifice; but
it is only from Abel that Scripture says: The Lord looked upon Abel and his
gifts. What does this word mean, looked? he states that God approved of Abel's
action, praised his intention, crowned his good will and, in a word, was
satisfied with his conduct. For if we dare to say something about God and open
our mouth to speak of this eternal Being, we can not do it, because we are men,
only in human language. But, oh prodigy! God looked at Abel and his gifts, that
is to say, the offering he made of his fattest and best sheep. So God looked at
Abel, because his sacrifice was from a pure and sincere heart. He looked also
at his gifts, because the sheep were spotless and precious, either in relation
to the intention of him who offered them, or in themselves, since they had been
taken from the firstborn of the flock, and that they were the fattest, that is
to say they were a choice made in all that was best.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And God looked upon Abel and his gifts; but he did not
look at Cain or his sacrifices. (Gen. VII, 5.) The sacrifice that Abel offered,
with a pure heart and a righteous will, was therefore pleasing to the Lord, who
accepted him and even deigned him. to rent. So he called Abel's offering to
better honor the sincerity of his intention. But he did not look at Cain or his
sacrifices. Observe here how accurately the sacred writer speaks. By saying
that God did not look at Cain, he tells us that he rejected his gifts, and
calling them sacrifices, he gives us a useful lesson. The action and the word
of God thus teach us that the Lord demands our sacrifices as an outward
testimony of the feelings of our soul and as a public protest that we recognize
for our Master and for the Creator who brought us out of nothingness. And
indeed, Scripture, which names the offering of some sheep, and sacrifices that
of some fruits of the earth, teaches us that the Lord seeks the purity of the
intention much more than he cares that we offer him animals or fruits. It was
this purity that made Abel's sacrifice pleasing to God; and it is a very
opposite disposition that rejected Cain's.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">It must also be understood in a sense worthy of God
these words: The Lord looked upon Abel and his gifts; but he kept neither Cain
nor his sacrifices. They signify that the Lord made the one understand that he
approved his good will, and the other that he rejected his ingratitude. Such
was the conduct of God; and now let's explain the next verse. And Cain was
violently grieved, and his face was shot down. Where did this violent sadness
come from? from a double principle: The Lord had rejected his sacrifice, and he
had approved that of Abel. This is why Cain was violently grieved, and why his
face was shot down. These two causes united to aggravate his sadness; the Lord
had rejected his offering, and he had received that of Abel. Now, (111) since
he had sinned, he had to do penance and correct himself, for our God is always
full of mercy, and he hates in us less sin than (hardening in sin.) But Cain
did not hold any account.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">6. For the rest, the Lord's conduct showed all the
greatness of his mercy, no less than the excellence of his goodness, and even
the excess of his patience. And indeed, when he saw Cain violently saddened,
and overwhelmed by the waves of pain, he did not look away from him, but he
remembered that he had behaved towards Adam with tender compassion, which he
had made it easier for him after his crime to obtain pardon for it, and that he
had opened to her the door of a humble confession by this interrogation: Adam,
where are you? So we see him bear witness to this ungrateful kindness, and
offer him, on the edge of the abyss, a helping hand. Thus, to smooth his ways
of penance and repentance, he said to him, "Why are you sad, and why is
your face downcast? Your offering was good in itself, but did you not sin in
the choice of fruits? so calm your irritation; his recourse will be in you and
you will dominate him. Consider here, my dear brother, the indulgent and
ineffable goodness of the Lord. He saw that Cain was prey to a violent evil,
and that a black jealousy assailed him strongly; and now he is hastening, in
his merciful tenderness, to offer him a salutary remedy. Even more, he offers
her a helping hand to pull her out of the waves that threaten to overwhelm her.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

downcast? Where does this sadness come from, so great that one can read on your
forehead the signs of deep sorrow? Why is your face all downcast? and what is
the cause of this melancholy? Why did not you think about what you were doing?
and did you think you were offering your sacrifices to a man who can be
deceived? Finally, do you not know that I have no need of the gifts of man, and
that I only consider in the sacrifice the intention of him who offers it? Why
are you sad? and why is your face downcast? your offering was good in itself;
but did not you sin in the choice of fruits? Yes, the thought of offering me a
sacrifice was commendable; and the bad choice of fruits offered alone made me
reject this sacrifice. The oblation of a sacrifice requires great precautions,
and the infinite distance which separates the God who receives it from the man
who presents it to him, commands. this one a serious attention in the choice of
the matter. But you did not make any of these reflections, and you offered me
the first fruits that you found under your hand. So I could not accept your
sacrifice.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

However, I do not hasten to punish your sin, and I only want to put it back to
you right now, and give you good advice. If you are, you will obtain your
forgiveness, and you will avoid frightful misfortunes. What is this advice? you
have sinned, and seriously; but I punish crime less than hardening in crime,
for I am good, and I do not wish for the death of the sinner, but to be
converted and live. (Ezek. Xviii. 27.) Also because you have sinned, sooth your
resentment, restore calm to your thoughts, banish from your mind trouble and
worry, and tear your soul from the tumultuous waves that threaten to engulf it.
but, above all, beware of falling into a still more serious sin, and of
precipitating yourself into irreparable despair. You have sinned, so calm your

Because all the secrets of our hearts are known to him, and he discovered the
movements that agitated that of Cain. So he seeks to cure him by paternal
opinions, and by a language full of condescension for his guilty dispositions.
He does not, therefore, attempt to bring back Cain to better feelings; but the
unfortunate man rejected the remedy, and rushed into the abyss of the
fratricide. You sinned, said the Lord, so calm your anger. No doubt I have
rejected your sacrifice because of your bad dispositions, and I have approved
that of your brother because of his pure and righteous intention; but do not
think I want to deprive you of the honor and privileges of the birthright. Calm
your anger, for though I have honored Abel, and received his gifts; but you
shall be his eldest, and he shall be subject to you. Thus, even after your sin,

enlighten his reason; and to restore calm and serenity to his soul, he assures
him that his brother will be submitted to him, and that he will lose nothing of

precepts, especially after these great and famous examples. Because now who
could apologize for his ignorance! Cain had not before him any previous example
which could hold him back, and yet he was condemned to the terrible and
dreadful chastisement we all know. What, then, will be that of Christians who,
filled with graces, commit the same sins, and still more! Do they not deserve
the eternal fire, the worm that does not die, the grinding of teeth, the outer
darkness, the flames of hell, and all the tortures that are inevitably reserved

we not know what to do, and what to omit? Besides, do we not know that those
who practice virtue will obtain immortal crowns, and that those who commit evil
are destined to eternal torments? I conjure you therefore, do not make our
assemblies useless, but translate into action the words that you hear. Thus,
reassured by the good testimony of our conscience, and leaning on Christian
hope, we will cross the stormy sea of ​​this life, and arrive at the port of
happy eternity. May we enjoy these ineffable goods that the Lord has promised
to those who love him! And may we obtain them, by the grace and mercy of His
only-begotten Son, to be, with His holy and adorable Spirit, glory, honor, and
empire, now and forever, and forever and ever. . So be it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

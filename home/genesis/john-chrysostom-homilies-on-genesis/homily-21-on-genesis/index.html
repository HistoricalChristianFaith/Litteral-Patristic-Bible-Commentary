</font><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt"><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">1. What treasure, what ineffable riches, my beloved,
in the words that have just been read to you! I am aware that a large number of
people; at the sight of the names composing a catalog, content themselves with
a superficial reading, and imagine themselves. that names having no particular
utility are merely words; but I, I urge you all not to simply go beyond,
without stopping, before what is reserved in Scripture. You will not find a
single word, which contains a great abundance of thoughts; for it was the
Spirit of God who inspired the blessed prophets; that is why the words, written
under the dictation of the Spirit, contain so many hidden treasures. Do not be
surprised that, in this catalog of names, I undertake to show you the richness
of the thoughts it contains. It is not a syllable, it is not a letter of
scripture that contains a treasure of deep thoughts. That is why it is fitting,
by following the grace from on high that guides us, by illuminating us with the
light of the Holy Spirit, to approach the expressions of God. Divine Scripture
has nothing to do with human wisdom to be understood; what is needed here is
the revelation of the Spirit, so that, enlightened by his help of the true
sense of thought, we may obtain a precious advantage. If, in the affairs of the
century, the writings of the hand of men, often deteriorated by time, must, at
a date which is at the head of the manuscript, a simple syllable, of great
importance, much more can we say the same of the divine Scripture, of this
composition of the Holy Spirit; only, let us show here our wisdom, let us not
run without stopping; Let us be attentive, diligent, let us consider everything
with meticulous exactitude, do not give in to those who show a zeal so ardent
for sensible things. See, in fact, those who search, who dig up metals; they do
not stop at the surface, they descend to a great depth. If they could find
plots of gold, what activity, what care to separate gold from the earth! and,
after so much fatigue, they find a slight consolation for their labors; they
are well aware, however, that the advantage which they will collect does not
answer their sentences; that, often, even after so many vigils and works, they
have been frustrated in their waiting. Whatever. They persist in their efforts;
the hope that nourishes them renders them insensitive to suffering. Well ! if
these men show so much ardor for corruptible, uncertain riches, of a possession
so doubtful, and still more for us, who pursue riches which nothing can take
away, a treasure which nothing can dispel, we, who Let us not show a vain hope,
must we show so much zeal, more zeal, to obtain the desired good, to collect
the precious fruit, to penetrate to us the ineffable goodness of the Lord, to
prove our gratitude to him; and, with the affection full of tenderness that we
have torn from God our Lord, make us invincible, impregnable, superior to all
traps of the devil. Well, then! since you have heard the reading of a moment
ago, let us carefully examine each of the expressions in detail, and may you,
after having received the usual instruction to bring back the benefit to your
inhabitants! This is the number of the seed of Adam, says the text. In the day
that God created man, God made him in his likeness; he created them male and
female, and he gave them the name of Adam in the day he created them. Be
careful, I implore you; see the wisdom of this admirable prophet, or rather,
the teaching of the Holy Ghost; for, as we have often said, it is by the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit that he speaks to us; he has only lent his
tongue to it, it is the grace of the Holy Ghost which instructs, by making use
of him, the whole human race. See, then, how he brings the discourse back to
the beginning of things, as it takes up the things that preceded it. Why, and
for what purpose? It is because he has seen the men of this time manifest great
ingratitude; the misfortune of our first father had not at all corrected them;
they were plunged into the abyss of such profound malignity. He who was born of
the first man, excited soon by envy, threw himself into fratricide; after such
a crime he had suffered the most terrible punishment; this teaching, my
brothers, we hastened to expose it to you. His descendants had in no way amped
by this punishment; they wrapped themselves in a web of even worse crimes.
Yesterday you heard Lamech telling his sin to his wives, and decreeing himself
the punishment.
<span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The Prophet, therefore, saw the perversity of these
men grow gradually, like an unhealthy mood which spreads through the whole
body; that is why he suppresses in his history this overflowing of corruption;
these generations from Cain to Lamech, he does not deign to recall them; but,
as if to tell the beginning of things, to console the mourning in which the
fratricidal arm against Abel had thrown Adam and Eve, he begins his account in
this manner: This is the number of the posterity of Adam. In the day that God
created man, God made him in his likeness; He created them male and female, and
he gave them the name of Adam, that is to say, terrestrial, in the day he
created them.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

to teach us that these infamous generations, he no longer judges them worthy of
memory; it begins with the child who lives then, I want to tell Seth, the
genealogy, to teach us how much life men are before God, and how God hates
bloodthirsty souls. He passes them in silence, as if they had not lived,
showing us all that is sinister in sin, teaching us the perverse. attract the
greatest evils. See! here they are now stricken from the catalog; their memory
is remembered only to show the infamy of their perversity, only for the example
and correction of the generations who follow them. But he whom injustice has
put to death, only the hand. of a brother deprived of life, from these times to
our days, is praised by all the mouths. No time has extinguished the memory of
one, nor diminished the crime of the other; this one, every day, is celebrated
by all men; the other remains forever attached to an infamous post.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

all that virtue has? Do you understand how even malice, which attacks and
triumphs, is struck with death and vanishes? how does virtue, attacked,
persecuted in combats without number, acquire for this reason even more brilliancy
and more glory? Other similar events could be drawn from the same teaching for
you, my beloved ones, but do not stray from our subject; let us take again the
words which you have heard: Here is the enumeration of the posterity of Adam.
In the day that God created man, God made him in his likeness; he created them
male and female, and he gave them the name of Adam in the day he created them.
See how, by this way of recounting the story from the beginning of the world,
divine Scripture reminds us of the insignificant honor that man has received
from his Creator. In the day, says the Scripture, that God created man, God
made him in his likeness, that is to say, put him at the head of all visible
creatures; in fact, this expression, in its resemblance, must be understood as
domination and command; for just as God commands all creatures, both visible
and invisible; since it is he who created everything, who did everything;
likewise, when he formed the animal which has the privilege of reason, he
wished to confer upon him the honor of commanding all visible creatures. As a
result he gave him the substance of the soul, wanting him also to possess
immortality, perpetuity. And now, when the man was broken by his fault, when he
had transgressed the commandment that had been done to him, even then, God did
not turn away completely from him. Always merciful, he undoubtedly took away
immortality, but he maintained in the same honor the one who was condemned to
die. Later, when the son of the first man was carried away with such fury, when
Cain first showed the world the face of death, murder in all its violence, and,
joining in the murder lies, had All perversity was manifested by God, by a long
punishment, to correct him, not only so that he might gain his advantage from
what was happening to himself, but also so that the following generations could
know the extent the crime, the excess, the infamy of the crime. Now, when these
cowardly, corrupted generations fell imperceptibly into still more vicious
vices, God willing, so to speak, consoled Adam, who was not only saddened by
his fault, but plunged, by the crime of Cain, into a unbearable mourning. He
had seen, with his own eyes, the body of Abel massacred; he did not know
beforehand what was the aspect of death, although the sentence of death had
been brought. Adam, therefore, suffered a double and triple cause of mourning,
for it was for the first time that death was introduced into life, violent
death, the work of a son against a brother, born of the same father, and of the
same mother, and this brother had done no harm to his murderer. God willing
therefore, in his goodness, to give the first father a consolation equal to his
pains; give him another son; you know his name, Seth; and after having sent him
this sufficient consolation, he draws from this son the beginning of the new
posterity. This is why the blessed prophet begins with these words: This is the
number of the seed of Adam. Then, as he has promised to tell the next
generation of mankind, see the succession he expounds: Adam, having lived a
hundred and thirty years, begot a son in his image and likeness, and he named
him Seth; After Adam had begot Seth, he lived seven hundred years, and begot
sons and daughters; and all the time of Adam's life being nine hundred and
thirty years, he died. (Gen. V, 3, 4, 5.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">3. Was not I right in saying that nothing is left to
chance, that every word contains thoughts in Holy Scripture? See again here the
diligent care of the blessed prophet: Adam, he said, begot such things in his
image and likeness, and he called him Seth. When he spoke of his first son, of
Cain, he said nothing of the sort, already sensing the inclination to evil, and
the prophet was right; for he did not preserve the manners which characterized
his father, but he quickly let himself be carried away to evil. Here, on the
contrary, he says: In his image and likeness, which means: having the same
customs as the one who had begotten him, retaining the same qualities of
virtue, destined to reproduce by his works the image of his father, to repair,
by his peculiar virtue, the fault of his elder brother. Indeed, Scripture does
not speak here of the features of the body, when it says: In his image and
likeness, but qualities of the soul, so that we understand that it will not
look like Cain. So (129) the mother of Seth, giving a name to her son, gives
thanksgiving; and it is not with nature, nor with childbirth, that she
attributes her new son, but to the virtue of God. It is, indeed, this virtue
which has made it fruitful; she names it by the name of Seth, saying: God has
made another seed in me in place of Abel whom Cain has killed. (Gen. IV, 25.)
See the choice of the expression! she does not say: God has given me, but, God
has made us reborn. Pay attention, see how the text shows here, in words
covered, the preludes of the resurrection; it seems to say: In the place of the
one who has fallen, God has revived in me this one. Abel, struck by the hand of
her brother, has fallen, she says: he is dead, but the virtue of God, instead
of the one who died, has aroused this one. Since it was not yet the time of the
resurrection, he did not remind the one who fell, but he revived another in his
place, which is why she said: God has made us reborn. me another seed instead
of Abel that Cain killed. Did you understand the recognition of the woman? Have
you understood the goodness of God, his readiness to send them consolation?
Let's imitate our mother, all of us; let us always recognize grace from above;
Whatever nature does, it does not operate, however, by its own virtue, but by
the order of the One who created it. He commands, she obeys. And that women
never engage in pain, to have no children; let them take refuge in an affection
full of gratitude, near the Creator of nature. What they ask, that they go and
claim it from the Master and Lord of nature, that they do not attribute to
their husbands, for whatever reason, the birth of their children, but to the
Creator of all beings, to him who has produced nature from nothing, to him who
can correct the failings of nature. The first woman found, even in her grief, a
motive for glorifying God; it is to the Lord that she attributes everything:
God has raised another seed in me in place of Abel whom Cain killed. See, not
only does she not complain, she utters no bitter words (the Holy Scripture
would have brought back any such word she could have uttered), but, on the
contrary, she bravely endures what happened ; she consoles herself quickly; it
manifests a more vivid gratitude; she celebrates the blessing of the Lord. See
how kindly the Lord does, on his side, that depends on him; he does not content
himself with giving him another son, but he indicates in advance the virtue
that will be in him. In fact, says the Scripture, Adam begot a son in his image
and likeness. And to make us understand, at once, the virtue of this son, see
how Adam himself shows, by the name he gives to his son, the piety of his soul:
He was born also a son to Seth qu he called Enos; he began to invoke the name of
the Lord God. (Gen. IV, 26.) Do you see that name more beautiful than a diadem,
brighter than purple? who could be happier than one who makes an adornment of
the invocation of the Lord and who carries it in his name?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Do you see, what I said at the beginning, that we find
in names, in simple names, rich treasures? Here, indeed, is shown not only the
piety of the parents, but their attention, their diligence for their children.
Here we see how immediately from the beginning they instructed their newly born
children; as they warned them, by the names they had given them, to practice
virtue. It was not then, as today, at random, and the first name come that was
given; the child, it is said today, will be called as his grandfather or
grandfather; formerly, we proceeded differently; all the care was taken to give
the children names which excited virtue, not only those who had received these
names, but also all other men, even in the ages to come: these names were all a
teaching of wisdom. The rest of this speech will make it clear to us.
Consequently, we, too, do not give the children the first names to come, the
names of ancestors, grandfathers, names which mark an illustrious birth; give
them the names of the saints, of those whose virtues have shone, of those who owe
their glory to their confidence, to their strength in the Lord; or rather, that
these names do not base the trust, neither of the parents, nor of the children
who carry them. Indeed, what is the use of a word, empty of virtue itself? What
is necessary for each one of us is to wait for his salvation, by operating it
by virtue; wisdom does not reside in names, in kinship with the saints, in some
external title, but in the confidence (130) that one draws from one's own
works. Let's say better: our blankets must not exaggerate the feeling we have
of ourselves; on the contrary, let us be humble, be modest, even more so when
we can pile up treasures of virtues; it is by this, in fact, that we will put
in safety, that it will be given us to preserve the acquired wealth, and to
reconcile us the benevolence of God. This is why Christ said to his disciples:
When you have accomplished all that is commanded to you, say we are useless
servants (Luke, XVII, 10), repressing by all means the pride of confidence,
persuading modesty, preventing the presumption that would result from good
works, showing them that the first of all virtues is wisdom in good works,
which keeps the measure.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">4. Let us now return to our subject, let us see the
succession of succeeding generations. It is probable that by advancing step by
step we will find a greater treasure of abundant and ineffable riches. And,
says the Scripture, Enos, son of Seth, having lived a hundred and ninety-five
arts, begat Cainan; and Cainan begot Malaleel; andMalaléelengendra Jared; and
.Iared begot Enoch. Enoch lived one hundred and sixty-five years and begat
Mathusala. Now, says the Scripture, Enoch was pleasing to God, and lived, after
begetting Mathusala, two hundred years, and he begotten. sons and daughters.
And all the days of Enoch's life were three hundred and sixty-five years old.
Enoch was pleasing to God, and he no longer appeared because God took him away.
(Gen. V, 7, 24.) Was not I right in saying that in advancing step by step, we
would find in these names a spiritual treasure, ineffable? Consider here, my
beloved, and the virtue of the righteous man, and the excess of the goodness of
God, and the diligent care of the Holy Scripture. Enoch, says the text, lived a
hundred and sixty-five years and begat Mathusala, and, says the Scripture,
Enoch was pleasing to God, after begetting Mathusala.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><br /></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Let all listen, and men and women, that all learn the
virtue of the righteous man, and let no one imagine that marriage is an
impediment to those who wish to make themselves agreeable to God; for Divine
Scripture proposes to instruct us here when it tells us on two occasions:
Begot Matlausala, and then was agreeable when it takes up this detail and
says to us: And it was agreeable to God after having begotten him. It is so
that no one sees marriage as an obstacle to virtue. If we have temperance, nor
the education of children, nor marriage, nor anything, will be an obstacle to
becoming pleasing to God. See, indeed, this man of the same nature as us; he
had not received the law, he had not been instructed by Scripture, he had no
guide to lead him to wisdom. Well ! he has found in himself, in the resources
of his will, what to make himself agreeable to God, so that he is alive, still
alive today, that he has never experienced death. If marriage, my beloved, or
the education of children was an impediment to virtue, the Creator of all
things would not have made marriage one of the states of our life, to injure us
in our first interests, to to make us lose what is most necessary to us; but,
not only does marriage not oppose any obstacle to the wisdom which God
commands, not only does it not hinder us in anything if we wish to practice
temperance; but, on the contrary, it is a great consolation, it is a brake
which represses the insensate ardor of nature, which prevents like the
turbidity of the waves which torment us, it is a means for us to happily sail
our boat. to the port, and that is why divine grace has given men this
consolation, This just, of which we speak to you, shows the truth of our words;
after Enoch, Scripture says, had begotten Mathusala, Enoch was pleasing to the
Lord. And he did not practice virtue for a few days; he lived, says the
Scripture, two hundred years. After the transgression of Adam, there was a man
capable of rising to the highest peak of virtue, of repairing the fault of our
first father, by the special favor he enjoyed with God. See here as the divine
goodness overflows! As soon as God found a man who could repair the sin of
Adam, God, to show by the reality that he did not want to strike the human race
with death, because of the disobedience of the past, when he condemned this
disobedience, take Enoch and remove him alive. Enoch, Scripture says, was
pleasing to God, and he did not appear, because God took him away. Do you see
the wisdom of the Lord? he removes it alive, (131) it does not give it
immortality, for fear of weakening the fear of sin; but he leaves in the midst
of men this fear in all his strength. It is for this reason that he revokes, so
to speak, in an obscure and latent manner, the sentence against Adam. He does
not do it visibly, because fear must serve to correct us. That's why, as Enoch
was quite nice to him, he took it off. Now, if curiosity dares to ask
questions: And where did he remove it? is he still alive today? I answer the
curiosity that this complacency for human thought is unsuitable, that one must
not explore so curiously the actions of God, that one must believe in the word.
When God pronounces, there must be no contradiction; what God reveals by his
words deserves, though invisible, more faith than all the objects subject to
our gaze; Scripture says that God took him away, that God lifted him alive,
that he did not suffer death, that, by the particular favor he enjoyed with God,
he became superior to the decree against all men. Where did God remove him?
what is Enoch doing today? Scripture did not say it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">You see the goodness of God: he finds a man of perfect
virtue, and he does not rob him of the dignity he had given to the first man
before his disobedience. God shows us that if the seduction of the devil had
not prevailed in Adam against obedience, he would have honored him with an
equal dignity, superior perhaps. Mathusala, having lived a hundred and
eighty-seven years, begat Lamech; Lamech, having lived a hundred and eighty
years, begot a son whom he called Noah, saying that He will make us rest from
our labors, and from the fatigues of our hands, and will comfort us in the land
which the Lord has cursed. (Gen. V, 25-29.) Now see in the name of the son of
Lamech a new proof of the greatness of the mysteries, of the excellence of the
prophecy, of the ineffable goodness of God. God, in his foreknowledge, foresaw
things to come; when he saw that the malice of men was increasing day by day,
he predicted, in the name of this child, the evils which were to melt down all
the race of men, so that, corrected by terror, they might renounce their vices
and embrace virtue; and see the patience of the Lord, who takes care that the prophecy
precedes the event long beforehand, to show his mercy and to deprive of any
excuse those who were reserved, in the future, for punishment.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">But perhaps I will be told: where did Lamech receive
such power of prophecy? Does Scripture tell us that his virtue was sublime,
admirable? Stop being astonished, my beloved; in His wisdom, in His power, Our
Lord often employs unworthy beings in the prediction of astonishing wonders,
and this is what we see, not only in the Old Testament, but also in the New.
Listen to the Evangelist, speaking of Caiaphas, the high priest of the Jews:
but he did not say this of himself; but, being high priest that year, he
prophesied that Jesus Christ should die for the nation of the Jews, and not
only for that nation, but also to gather and reunite the nations that were
scattered. (John, XI, 51.) You will find an example of the same kind about
Balaam. Indeed, called to curse the people, not only does he not curse him, but
he also predicts many amazing things, not only concerning the people, but also
on the advent of our Savior. (Numbers XXIV.) Stop, then, from astonishing the
name that Lamech gave to his child, but bring it all to the wisdom of God, who
disposes all things. And he called her Noah. This name means: rest. So this universal
destruction, which must come after so much. of years, it is called rest; This
is how Job says: Death is a rest for man. (Job, III, 23.) Corruption is
fatigue, work, excess of punishment; and that which stops it, and that which
cuts it off, the disaster which was to make it disappear, is called repose; and
he called her, says the text, the name of Noah. Then follows the explanation of
the name: This one will make us rest from our labors, that is to say, will turn
us away from our iniquity, and from the fatigues of our hands; it is the same
thought: we will turn away, means the text, from our evil works. The Scripture,
in fact, does not mean the actual pains of the hands, but the bad works, the
criminal actions which increased the pains; and will comfort us in the land
that the Lord has cursed, that is, free us from all the evils that press us,
from the hardships and miseries that we endure in cultivating the land that has
incurred (132) the curse, because of the disobedience of the first man. . Make
a remark here, my beloved; this little child grows up little by little, and he
is, for all those who see him, an opportunity to educate himself, for soon each
of those who inquired about the name of the child must have known, on hearing
the explanation from this name, the universal destruction that was to happen.
Suppose that an inspired man had only announced it in advance, the prediction
would have been soon forgotten, all would not have known the terrible
punishment; but behold, he whom every eye can see, announces in due course, and
well before the time, the anger of the indignant God. And now that we know
exactly how long, by the name alone, the son who bore this name continued to
warn all men to renounce sin and to embrace virtue, To escape from wrath, Scripture
says: Noah, being five hundred years old, begot three sons. (Gen. V, 32.) You
see again another righteous with a wife and sons; who has surrendered, by doing
good, quite agreeable to God; who, doing the opposite of all others, has chosen
the path of virtue; and neither marriage nor the education of children have
been an obstacle to him. And now what must be admired is the ineffable patience
of God and the prodigious corruption of the men of this time. This is, indeed,
for five hundred years, a screaming righteous, whose only name proclaims the
universal flood, which will come to punish the excess of human malice, and,
despite this warning, they have not given up their iniquities. However, the God
of mercy, even after such an eloquent prophecy, after so many years, does not
yet send punishment; he adds to his patience, he adds a few more years to his
sweetness that supports evil. It is because he did not create the human race to
punish him, but, on the contrary, to fill him with innumerable goods, which he
would see us enjoy. This is why you see God everywhere hesitating, adding
delays to delays, delaying punishment. But we do not want, under the multitude
of our words, to overwhelm your memory; we will stop here, postponing until
tomorrow the other explanations.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">6. Let us not just hear these words, my beloved ones;
but let us apply ourselves to practice virtue, to consider it a great good to
make ourselves agreeable to God; do not make the government of our house, or
the anxieties we conceive for our women, or the care we owe our children, or
any other motive, an excuse, an excuse, sufficient for us, that we are forgiven
for our negligence and laziness; let us not repeat these words, without
bearing, without reason: I am of the world, I have a wife, I take care of my
children; what we are accustomed to say to ourselves when we ask that we apply
ourselves to the labors of virtue, let us ardently read the Scripture. It's not
my business, I'm told; did you give up the world? Am I a monk? What do you say,
O man? Is it only for the monks to be agreeable to God? It is all men he wants
to save, that he wants to see come to the knowledge of the truth (I Tim II, 4),
practicing all the virtues. Hear it, saying to us through the Prophet, I do not
want the sinner's death, but to convert and live. (Ezekiel, XVIII, 23.) Come
on, answer me, did this righteous find an obs. tackle in the union that tied
him to his. wife, or in the care he took of his children? So, I beg you, let's
not be the first to deceive ourselves. The more worried we are, the more we
must be eager for the remedies provided by the reading of Holy Scripture. Is it
not true, then, that these righteous were men like us, and had not, as much as
we, any help for virtue? What will be our excuse for us, who enjoy such a
doctrine, who have obtained so many graces, who are strengthened from above,
who have received the promise of these ineffable goods, if we did not go
further? than men of old in virtue! If we want to practice wisdom, it is enough
for the words heard today to excite in us the love of good, to show us that
there is no obstacle between good and us. If the men who lived before the law
could, by the light of nature alone, attain to a virtue so high, what can we
say, we, who, after so much care that we have for ourselves, after the advent
of Christ, after so many miracles without number, are still so far from virtue?
So, I conjure you, (133) do not just become just to see what is in Holy
Scripture; be attentive; let us read it so that it may be useful to us, to
withdraw as late as you like, to extract some day, some virtue dear to God, and
which we will conquer. For if it is necessary that every day we announce to you
this spiritual doctrine, while you remain in the same inertia, what will serve
you this continual teaching? What will be the consolation for us, to see that
so many efforts we make are useless, and that we gain nothing with all our
zeal? Come, talk to me; are we not composed of two substances, I say of a soul
and a body? Well! So, why do not we also spend our care for both? How is it
that we look after our bodies in every way, that we bring in the doctors, that
we personally treat them with the greatest diligence, we cover them with
precious stuffs, we take food more than do we want it to be in a state of
continual prosperity, that no evil ever come to torment him? If, sometimes,
some disturbance disturbs him, we put everything in motion to remove what is
uncomfortable. And what I say, I say of this body which is only the second of
our substances; for finally, let's see: what is the most noble? Is it the soul
or the body? If it is necessary to show the difference in your eyes, notice
that your body is nothing, since the soul has separated from it. Well ! you,
who take for this body so great a concern, by what motive, in view of what, do
you despise so much your soul, to the point of not giving him his share of
food? By that I mean the warnings of Holy Scripture. To the wounds, to the
ulcers which enervate his forces, which destroy his confidence, you do not
bring the proper remedies; you leave it, this despised soul, to dry out by
hunger, to rot in its ulcers; give me the word, throw it at the dogs, at the
evil thoughts, at the criminal thoughts, which tear it apart, break down, ruin
all its energy.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></div><div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">We take care of the body that we have before our eyes:
why do not we also care for the soul, intangible, invisible, and that, when the
care it requires, not only is it kind and easy, but still not claim neither
expenses nor fatigue? When the body is sick, it takes money and money, either
for doctors or for other necessities, necessities of clothing, food. I do not
want to mention here spending beyond the necessary, luxury spending. The soul,
on the contrary, has no such need. If you want, since every day you supply the
body with food, since you spend for the body, money, if you like, so that your
soul does not die of hunger, if you consent to give it the good food, you are
well acquainted with the text of Scripture, the spiritual warning: Man does not
live by bread alone, says the Lord, but from every word that comes out of the
mouth of God (Matt IV, 4) take the wisest course, take care of the substance
which is ours. Well, then! as you provide the body with various clothes, you
take into account the diversity of the seasons in the diversity of your
clothes, do the same for the soul, do not neglect it, do not let it come and go
naked, devoid of good works ; put on the clothes that go with her, and
immediately you will comfort her, you will restore her health that suits her
nature. What are the clothes of the soul? Almsgiving, the money lavished on the
poor; this is the most beautiful garment of the soul; that's what makes him a
splendid coat. And now, if you want not only to give him clothes, but,
moreover, to adorn her, embellish her, as you make a body, add to it the help
that comes from prayers, the confession of sins; do not stop washing the face
of your soul in the tears of penance. Every day you wash your face with
complete solicitude, lest some stain disfigure your face, apply to your soul a
care of the same kind; cleanse it every day with your burning tears. This
removes the stains of the soul, and restores its purity and glory.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">And since the indolent vanity of a large number of
women despises this precept of the Apostle: Let them not be likened to curly
hair, nor ornaments of gold, nor pearls, nor sumptuous garments (I Tim II, 9),
since they display great luxury in the violation of this precept; and since
(134) not only women, but also all that are indolent and soft men, fall back to
the state of femmelettes, and that we see them, rings fingered, covered, loaded
of precious stones, of which they should blush, which they ought to conceal; I
say that these men, I say that these women, if our speeches were heard, instead
of looking for these adornments, fatal to men, fatal to women, it would be
better to use these ornaments to embellish their souls. Applied to a body, even
when this body has beauty in sharing, these ornaments make it ugly; applied to
the soul, even to an ugly soul, these ornaments communicate to it all the
splendor of beauty. And how, shall I be told, on the soul, gold ornaments?
Again, tie them by the hand of the poor. It is they who, in receiving them,
compose this beauty. Put your gold ornaments in their hands, give them food,
and, in exchange, they will give to your soul that radiance of beauty which
will draw near it its true fiance, with its thousand and one thousand treasures
. When you have by your beauty forced your Lord to come near you, then you
hold, you possess all the goods in a crowd; you are rich in the depths of
ineffable abundance; therefore, if we wish to become the beloved of the Lord,
let us stop admiring with astonishment the artificial beauty of the body; think
no more every day than the beauty of the soul, to reconcile the benevolence of
the God of goodness, to enter into the division of goods which no expression
can render, by the grace and kindness of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
belongs, as well as to the Father and the Holy Spirit, glory, power, honor, and
now, and always, and forever and ever. So be it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

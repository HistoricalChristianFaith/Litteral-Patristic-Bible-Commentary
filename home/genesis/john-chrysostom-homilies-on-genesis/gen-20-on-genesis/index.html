provide us with the subject of today's instruction; we will continue to talk to
you about the books of Moses, or rather the oracles of the Holy Spirit, oracles
which divine grace has communicated to us through the organ of his prophet. But
for the sake of clarity, it will not be out of place to remind your charity of
what we have already expounded, and where our teaching has remained; in this
way we can resume it where we have left it, and the sequence of the doctrine
will not be broken. We have therefore treated the subject of Abel and Cain; we
have shown (120) by their history, as by the sacrifices they offered to the
Lord, that the knowledge of the good we must do and of the evil that we must
avoid doing is inherent in our nature; that the Divine Worker, the one who did
everything, has endowed us with free will; that it is the disposition of our
heart which brings us condemnation or crown; that it was, indeed, the reason
why the sacrifice of Abel was accepted and that of Cain rejected; that the
jealousy which Cain conceived led him to the murder of his brother; that after
this execrable crime, God provoked him to confess his sin, that the patient
rejected this divine remedy, that he finally drew upon his head the severe
punishment which you know, for having added the lie to the murder; that he thus
deprived himself of all help from on high, became an example capable of holding
in duty those who would come after him; that by the sentence against him he
instructs the whole human race, as though he were saying to him aloud, 'No man
among you commits the same crime, unless he wishes to suffer the same
punishment.' On this subject I have pointed out to you the goodness of the
Lord, who desired, by the pain he inflicted, not only to correct Cain, but also
to teach all who would be born after him, to guard himself from a similar
crime. .</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Let us now see what is going on, and consider what the
blessed prophet is saying today through the virtue of the Holy Spirit. After he
heard his sentence, Cain went out from before the face of God. What does this
word mean: went out from before the face of God? It means that he was deprived
of divine assistance because of his abominable action. And he dwelt in the land
of Naid, opposite Eden. The sacred writer tells us the place where Cain made
his home, and he teaches us that he lived not far from paradise, so that he
would perpetually remember and what had happened to his father after his
prevarication and the enormity of his own crime, and the punishment inflicted
on him, because he had not been able to take advantage of his father's example
to behave wisely. The place he himself inhabited, reminded him continually by
his name of his and his descendants, the agitation and the trembling, the
torment of his terrestrial life, for the name of Naid is a Hebrew word which
signifies agitation. So God established it there, so that the place itself
would not cease to reproach it for its crime, as if it were engraved on a
column of brass.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">The Holy Scripture continues: And Cain knew his wife,
and having conceived, she bore Enoch. Since men had become mortal, they were
right to perpetuate themselves through the procreation of children. But,
perhaps someone will tell me, where Cain had a wife, since at this age of.
less, does not the Scripture mention any other than Eve? Do not be surprised,
my dear listener; nowhere does Scripture give exactly the genealogy of women;
always careful to avoid the superfluous, she mentions only men and not all men,
because she often says in an abbreviative form that such a father begot sons
and daughters. We must therefore believe that Eve gave birth, after Cain and
Abel, to a girl whom Cain took for a wife. In these early beginnings of the
world, the necessity of propagating the race made it possible for men to marry
their sisters. So leaving us to make these conjectures, besides some, the holy
Scripture itself. It is hard to tell that Cain knew his wife, who conceived,
gave birth to Enoch. And he built a city named after his son Enoch. See how
they become little by little ingenious and wise. Mortals, they want to at least
immortalize their memory, either by generating children, or by building cities
to which they give the names of their children. One could rightly say that all
these things were so many monuments to their sins and their decay of that
primitive glory which Adam and Eve enjoyed, in which they had no need of all
these precautions, since then they were in a state where could not. to reach

how the sacred writer passes by on genealogies, mentioning only men, and leaving
women without naming them. Likewise, concerning Cain, he said that he knew his
wife, without telling us where he had been from; in the same way, concerning
Lamech, he says: and Lamech married two women; the first was named Ada, and the
second (121) was named Sella. And Ada bore Jobel; he was the father of those
who live in tents and feed herds. And the name of his brother was Jubal: he
invented the psaltery and the zither.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

explained and to provide us with the most valuable lessons.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella listen to my
voice, women of Lamech, listen to my words: I killed a man who wounded me, and
a young man who wounded me. Cain's death seven times, and Lamech's
seventy-seven times. Lend me, I pray you, all your attention, and rejecting all
secular thought and distraction, scrutinize these words carefully; we must
descend to the full depth we can, so that we may collect, without losing
anything, all the treasure that is buried in this narrow space. And Lamech said
to his wives Ada and Sella listen to my voice, Lamech women, lend an ear to my
words. And first notice how useful Cain's punishment was to Lamech. He does not
wait for another to convince him of his crime, but, without anyone accusing him
or reproaching him, he reveals himself, he confesses what he did, he reveals to
his wives the greatness of his crime, he almost fulfills the word of the
Prophet: The righteous himself is his accuser in the first place. (Prov.xviii,
17.) For the correction of sins, there is no better remedy than confession. It
is something more serious than sin itself, than to deny it after it has been
committed: the fratricide Cain has experienced it, he who, questioned by the
good God, not only He did not admit his crime, but dared to lie to God, and was
therefore condemned to drag a long and miserable life on earth. Falling into
the same sin, Lamech understood that what had aggravated Cain's punishment was
to have denied his fault; that is why he calls his wives, and, without any one
compelling him or testifying against him, he himself makes his own confession
of his sins, and comparing his crime with that of Cain, he determines himself
his sentence.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Do you see the solicitude of God, as he spares
occasions to show his mercy, even in the punishments he inflicts, as the
effects of this mercy do not stop at the one who receives punishment, but
extend, as salutary remedies, to all those who have the good will to enjoy it?
What other motive could have led Lamech to make this confession, except the
memory that he had of the evils suffered by Cain, a memory which upset his
soul? And he said, Hear my voice, and listen to my words. It is like a tribunal
which he draws against himself, and the thing seems so serious to him that he
wants to be listened to with a great deal of attention. For these words: Listen
to my voice, lend ear to my speeches, equivalent to these: Make your mind
attentive, apply yourself, listen carefully what I am about to say. It is not
indifferent things that I have to talk to you about; I have to reveal to you
hidden facts, facts that no one knows except me, and that eye that never
closes; it is the fear that this witness gives me, which presses me and forces
me today to. to discover what I had the misfortune to do, and to tell you to
what revenge I exposed myself by my criminal works; for I killed a man who hurt
me, and a young man who wounded me. And if seven revenges of Cain have been
fired, Lamech will be fired seven times seven. Great, and even very great, and
denoting in this man a soul of the best disposition. Not only does he confess
(122) what he did, and reveal the murder he committed, but he imposes a penalty
by comparing his crime to that of Cain. What pardon does he seem to say is
worthy of him who has not profited from the example of others to become better,
he who has constantly in mind the memory of the punishment inflicted on the
first murderer, not left nevertheless that to commit two murders? I killed,
said he, a man who wounded me, and a young man who wounded me. It is as if he
said: I did less harm to those whom I killed than I did to myself. Because I
incurred an inevitable punishment, since I committed crimes that were too big
to be forgiven. If Cain, for one murder, deserved seven revenges, I incurred
seventy-seven times. Why, by what reason? In fact, although he was homicidal
and even fratricidal, however, he did not have before his eyes the example of a
man who would have dared such a crime, which would have been punished, which
would have attracted him the weight of God's wrath; two aggravating
circumstances for me, since I had before me the double example of crime and
punishment, and that I have not been better. That is why, even if I had seven
revenges seven times, I would not have paid enough for what I did.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">3. See, my dear listener, how God has created our free
will and mistress of his determinations; how, when we fall, it is our
negligence that is the cause, and how, when we want to be vigilant, we clearly
distinguish between the duty? Who, tell me, pushed this man to make such a confession?
Nobody, if not conscience, this incorruptible judge. After, according to the
inclination of bad nature, he executed a culpable design, immediately the
conscience rose in him raising his voice against the enormity of the crimes
committed and denouncing to him how many punishments he had rendered
punishable. Such is the sin before it is done and done, it obscures the
reasoning and deceives the mind. But when it is consumed, it is then that we
clearly see its absurdity; and this rapid and absurd pleasure flies away,
leaving us with a lasting pain; he flies away, taking with him that noble
assurance which was the joy of conscience, after having substituted for it the
shame in which the unfortunate sinner remains. The good God has attached to us
this intimate accuser, with orders never to leave us, to shout incessantly,
asking us for our prevarications. To convince oneself of this, one must only
consult the experience. The fornicator, adultery, may well have not been
surprised, they are no more tranquil; thanks to this energetic and
indefatigable accuser, they are afraid of suspicion, they tremble for a shadow,
they fear those who know, those who do not know, it is in their soul an
incessant storm, waves succeeding the waves. Sleep, for such a man, has no more
sweetness, he has only fears and terrors. There is nothing to restore it,
nothing calms its inner turmoil: neither the sweetness of the food, nor the
charm of a friendly conversation. After this bad action, however, made without
witness, it is as if he carried everywhere in himself an executioner who would
always flog him. Such are the pains he endures without any other judge, without
any other accuser than himself.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">If, however, the guilty party wishes to profit by the
warnings of his conscience, resort to the confession of his faults, show his
wound to the spiritual doctor who awaits him to heal him, and not to reproach
him, if he wishes to receive his remedies, to maintain alone with him without
witness and to say everything without dissimulating anything, he will obtain
quickly and easily the absolution of his sins. The confession of the evil we
have done is the abolition of the sins committed. If Lamech did not refuse to
accuse his women of the murders committed by him; What pardon will we be worthy
of ourselves, if we do not want to accuse our sins before Him who knows exactly
the least of our faults? Because he knows nothing and it is not for education
that he wants us to confess, since he knows all things before they even arrive.
He commands the confession so that we ourselves have the feeling of our faults,
and so that we show good will towards him. Is it a question of great expenses
to be made, long journeys to undertake? Is the treatment to undergo painful and
painful? On the contrary, healing takes place at no cost, without pain and
promptly. The Divine Physician appropriates his remedies to the degree of good
will of him who comes to him to be healed of his wounds. Let the man who wants
to recover his health quickly and heal the wounds of his soul, come to the
doctor, the sober and vigilant soul, and free from all the secular
preoccupations, let it shed many tears, he gives marks of great assiduity, that
he brings a firm faith and a complete confidence in the science of the doctor,
and he will not be long in recovering his health. O doctor whose goodness
erases that of the most tender father! Is it nothing less painful and less
harsh than the conditions he demands of us, the contrition of the heart, the
compunction of the soul, the admission of the fault, a constant assiduity? And
he not only gives us the grace to heal our wounds, but he erases them to the
slightest trace. We were previously overwhelmed with the weight of a thousand
sins and He makes us righteous. O infinite mercy, incomparable goodness! A
sinner comes, he confesses his sins, he asks for forgiveness, he shows a firm
resolve not to sin in the future, and here he is. And so that you do not doubt
this miracle, listen to this word of the prophet: Say your sins first, that you
may be justified. (Isaiah XLIII, 26.) He does not simply say, say your sins,
but he adds: the first; that is to say, do not wait for another to accuse you
and convince you; warn the prosecution, hasten to speak, close that strange
mouth that will speak against you.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

human courts, if an accused followed this conduct; if, warning the proofs, he
confessed all that he had done, he might save himself the question with his
trials and his tortures, if, however, he had to deal with a lenient judge; but
the sentence which condemns the last punishment, he certainly would not avoid
it. As for our God, this charitable physician of our souls, his goodness is
infinite, and his mercy ineffable. If we take the lead on our adversary, on the
devil who will make our accuser to. the last day and who is already in this
life, if we make our confession before appearing before the tribunal, if we
ourselves speak to accuse us, we will excite the mercy of the Sovereign Judge,
to the point that no pleased to absolve us from our faults, he will still
inscribe our name among those of the just.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

not heard of prophets, he did not obey any exhortation from the. Outside, he
had only his conscience to make him feel the seriousness of his faults, and yet
this inner voice is enough to snatch him the confession and condemnation of
what he had done, and we would be excusable do not show our wounds carefully to
the charitable doctor who only needs that to heal them! And this confession, if
we did not do it now that the time of fasting offers us a favorable occasion,
by the calm which he has put in our thoughts, by the exclusion which he has
given to all kinds of voluptuousness, when, then, could we enter into ourselves
in such a way as to bring order to the affairs of our conscience? Let us be
sober and vigilant, I entreat you, let us devote ourselves entirely to this important
matter, and by dint of diligence and care avoid a punishment that will be so
severe, save us from the fire of hell. Now is the time to work, now that the
time of fasting offers you more resources by the frequent instructions you
receive.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12pt">Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she, having conceived,
bore a son, and she called him Seth, saying, God hath given me another seed in
the place of Abel, whom Cain slew. Stopping the genealogical list at Lamech,
the holy Scripture goes back to Adam and his wife, and says: Now Adam knew his
wife, and the latter conceived, and bare a son, and she called him Seth,
saying, God bless me. has created another posterity and the place of Abel
killed by Cain. She bore, is it written, a son, and she named him Seth. Not
content to have given a name to his newborn, the mother adds: God has given me
another posterity and the place of Abel killed by Cain. Notice the care taken
by this mother, by the name she gives to her son, of perpetuating the memory of
this abominable crime; it is so that future generations learn the murder
committed by Cain, which she says: instead of Abel killed by Cain. The word of
a mother afflicted by grief, troubled by the memory of a sad event, a word of
thanksgiving for the son whom God sends, but a word which, in the name of the
newborn, imprints in a way . ineffaceable the crime of another son. And indeed,
what bitter mourning Cain had not caused to his parents, when he had armed his
hand against his brother, when he had made them see that child so tenderly loved,
lying on the ground, dead, deprived of movement. Adam had of course pronounced
his judgment: You are earth and you will return to the earth; and again: The
day you eat it, you will die of death; but until then the sentence had remained
in words, and our first parents had not yet seen what death was; Cain, driven
by his hatred against his brother, and the envy that gnawed at him, threw
himself upon Abel and killed him, and he showed his parents a horrible sight.
That is why the mother, to whom the birth of a new child helped to lift a
little the weight of her mourning, gives thanks to the Lord for the consolation
he gives her, but at the same time she wants to perpetuate the memory of the
fratricide, thus punishing in turn the culprit of a new and severe punishment.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

mark of shame and infamy on those who commit it; as after depriving Cain of
help from above, he made it the toy of the world? Do you see how, by his
detestable sin, he has become odious even to his parents, whom nature, however,
inclines so much to tenderness for their children. Let us flee, I conjure you,
that sin which surrounds us with so many evils, and embrace virtue, which will
procure us celestial favor, and remove punishment from us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

name of Enos; he trusted to invoke the name of the Lord. Notice here how men
are gradually becoming accustomed. to testify to God's gratitude in the names
they give to their children. So Seth had a son and he named him Enos, tells the
Holy Scripture; then, to interpret the meaning of this name, she adds: He
trusted to invoke the name of the Lord. So it is through Seth, and by Enos and
their descendants, that the blessed Prophet will establish his genealogy; now
he leaves Cain and his offspring behind from Lamech. Cain lost his birth
privilege, I mean his firstborn privilege: he lost it freely by his wickedness,
and he and his posterity are excluded from the list. On the contrary, Seth
obtains by virtue a prerogative that nature has refused him: primogeniture
rights are transferred to him in spite of nature, because his will turned to
good, and his descendants are called to honor to form the genealogy of the
first ancestors of humanity. Enos was so called because of his confidence in
invoking the name of the Lord God, and those born of him will bear the same
name. Here our blessed Prophet suspends his narration, and goes back once again
to begin another story.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

to prolong our instruction beyond the bounds; on the example of the sacred
author, let us stop here and, if God permits, give another explanation of the
result. Now I would like to urge your charity to profit more and more from our
teaching, to examine you every day, asking you for yourself what fruit you have
derived from such instruction, what fruit of another; not to be content to
receive our words in your ears without making them penetrate further, but to
open their hearts to them so that they dwell there permanently, strengthened
and strongly implanted by the meditation. I would also like that; Not content
with teaching you for yourselves, you became masters for others, to warn and
guide them in the path of virtue, not only by your words, but especially by
your examples. Remember that if you wanted to come up with some fruit, to
correct anything of the bad passions that torment you, think of how soon you
could reach the very fact of virtue. Indeed, we never forget in our
instructions to inculcate the principles of the perfect life, in order to lead
you to extirpate from your souls those passions that give them death, such as
anger, jealousy, envy. These suppressed ones, your disordered love of riches
will be corrected more easily, and when you have finally extinguished it, it
will be much easier for you to get rid of your dishonest thoughts, your impure
imaginations.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

vii, 10.) If, then, we cut off the root, if we tear it out entirely, we will
then easily come to the end of the twigs. Yes, I will say in my turn, the
fortress of evils, the citadel of all sins, it is the rage of riches, and if we
wanted to triumph, we would have (125) nice game to get rid of all the
fatalities passions that depend on it. And do not think that it is a very big
and difficult thing to despise wealth. When I consider that so many men who,
for a frivolous satisfaction to give to their vanity, sacrifice so much money
for nothing, to win the favor of this vile multitude, this ragged populace that
clutters the squares of a city a favor which ends with the evening, which does
not even wait often for the evening to dissipate, a favor which sometimes
produces so many disappointments even before the day ends; when I also consider
those others who, among the Gentiles, conceive such a passion for glory that
they renounce all they possess to acquire it, reserving for themselves only an
old coat with a stick, which they resign themselves to spend all their lives in
this way, to bear all this pain and misery because they hope to acquire a
certain renown among men; when I think about these things, I do not know what
excuse, what forgiveness we can count on, we who do not have the courage to
impose the slightest sacrifices to fulfill the commandments of God, to acquire
an immortal and imperishable glory. Yes, we do less than these men, and yet
what a difference between the rewards to conquer! It is for the gain of a vain
renown among men their fellow men that they make these great sacrifices,
instead of us being for our Master, for Him from whom we hold everything, for
Him who promises us. still ineffable goods, that we do not even want to give
the smallest alms to a poor man!</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

cold, and, by their means, send it to your country where you will soon find it.
These unfortunates will serve you very well in transporting your wealth to the
other world; and when you succeed, you will find them perfectly preserved, so
that you will live in abundance, thanks to these goods thus transported, and

laborious, very thorny? This transport is done without a pack animal, without

a safe place; since you deposit it in the hand of God. It will keep your
deposit intact, this divine hand and when you enter your homeland it will
return it to you; it will reward you with praise, with crowns, with the
fullness of a happiness without limit or decline. So pour, pour your riches and

<div style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"><strong><font size="4">Genesis 1</font></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth," </em>[ Gen 1:1 ] that is, the substance of the heavens and the substance of the earth. So let no one think that there is anything interpretive (turgama) in the works of the six days. No one can rightly say that the things that pertain to these days were symbolic, nor can one say that they were meaningless names or that other things were symbolized for us by their names. Rather, let us know that just as heaven and earth were created in the beginning, so they were truly heaven and earth. There was no other thing signified by the names "heaven" and "earth". The rest of the works and things made that followed were not meaningless significations either, for the substances of their <span>natures</span> correspond to what their names signify. 
<p><a name="div01.2"></a><i>"In the beginning God created heaven and earth." </i>[ Gen1:1 ] At this point these comprised the only things that had been made, for there was nothing else created along with heaven and earth. Even the elements that were created on that day had not yet been created. If the elements had been created along with heaven and earth, Moses would have said so. But he did not, lest he give the names of the elements precedence over their substances. Therefore it is evident that heaven and earth came to be from nothing because neither water nor wind had yet been created, nor had fire, light or darkness been given their <span>natures</span>, for they were posterior to heaven and earth. These things were created things that came after heaven and earth and they were not self-subsistent beings for they did not exist before [ heaven and earth ]. 
<p><a name="div01.3"></a>After this Moses spoke not of the <span>firmament</span> and things that were above [it], but rather of those things that were between the <span>firmament</span> and the earth which is within [ the <span>firmament</span> ]. Moses wrote about [ the things within the <span>firmament</span> ] for us, although he did not write about everything for us, for he did not record for us the day on which the spiritual things were created. 
<p><a name="glossGen1:2,Gen1:3"></a>Moses then goes on to write about the earth, <i>"that it was tohu and bohu, " </i>[ Gen1:2 ] that is, void and desolation. This is to show that even the void and desolation were prior to the elements. I am not saying that the void and desolation were something, but rather that that earth which was to become well-known did not exist, for only the [primitive] earth, without any other [adornment] existed. 
<p><a name="div01.4"></a>After Moses spoke about the <span>creation</span> of heaven and earth and showed that the waste and desolation preceded the elements that were created by the length of that moment that followed [their <span>creation</span> ], he turned to write about those elements saying, <i>"Darkness was upon the face of the <span>abyss</span>" </i>[ Gen1:2 ] . For the <span>abyss</span> of waters was created at that time. But how was it created on the day on which it was created? Even though it was created on this day and at this time, Moses does not tell us here how it was created. For now we should accept the <span>creation</span> of the <span>abyss</span> as it is written, while we wait to learn from Moses how it was created. 
<p>As for the darkness that was upon the face of the <span>abyss</span>, some posit that it was a cloud of heaven. Now, if the <span>firmament</span> had been created on the first day they would speak rightly. If the upper heavens were similar to the <span>firmament</span>, then there would be a thick darkness between the two heavens, for the light had not been created nor affixed there to dissipate the darkness there by its rays. But if the place between the two heavens is light as Ezekiel, Paul, and Stephen bear witness, then how could the heavens, which had dissipated the darkness with their lights, spread darkness over the <span>abyss</span>? 
<p><a name="div01.5"></a>Because everything that was created was created in those six days, whether its <span>creation</span> was written down or not, the clouds must also have been created on that first day, just as fire was created along with wind, although Moses did not write about the fire as he did about the wind. Thus, the clouds were created along with the <span>abyss</span> although Moses did not write that the clouds were created along with the <span>abyss</span>, just as he did not record the <span>creation</span> of fire along with that of the wind when he wrote about the <span>creation</span> of the wind. 
<p>It was necessary that everything be known to have its beginning in those six days. The clouds were surely created along with the <span>abyss</span>, for how many times were these brought forth from the <span>abyss</span>? Elijah saw a cloud rising up out of the sea. Solomon also said, "By his knowledge the depths broke forth and the clouds sprinkled down dew." It was not only because of their substance that they should have been created at this point, but they were created on that first night because they also rendered service on that first night. Just as the clouds covered Egypt for three days and three nights, clouds were spread over all of <span>creation</span> on the first night and on the first day. If the clouds had been dispersed, light would not have been required on the first day because the brightness of the upper heavens would have been sufficient to fill the place of the light that was created on the first day. 
<p><a name="div01.6"></a>After one night and one day were completed, the <span>firmament</span> was created on the second evening and henceforth its shadow rendered service for all subsequent nights. Therefore, heaven and earth were created on the evening of the first night. Along with the <span>abyss</span> that was created there were also created those clouds which brought about the requisite night when they were spread out. After their shadow had served for twelve hours, light was created beneath them and the light dispersed their shadow that had been spread over the waters all night. 
<p><a name="div01.7"></a>After Moses spoke of the darkness that was spread over the face of the <span>abyss</span>, he then said, <i>"the wind of God was hovering over the face of the waters." </i>[ Gen1:2 ] Because Moses called it the "wind of God" and said "it was hovering," some posit that this is the Holy Spirit and, because of that which is written here, associate it with the activity [of <span>creation</span>.] Nevertheless, the faithful do not make this connection, for they are not likely to so relate it. Rather, by those things that are truly said about it, they associate it with that element. To the end that from these names they are not able to consider the Spirit as active in <span>creation</span>. For it is said that an evil spirit of God consumed Saul. 
<p>It is also said that "[ the wind ] was hovering," but what came forth from the waters on the first day when [ the wind ] was hovering over the waters? If on the day that it was written that "it was hovering over the waters" nothing came out of the waters, and then on the fifth day when the waters brought forth reptiles and birds, it was not written that the wind "was hovering," how then can anyone say that this wind took part in the activity of <span>creation</span>? For, although scripture says "it was hovering", it did not say that anything came out of the waters on the day that it was hovering. 
<p>Just as through the service of the clouds, that is, the shadow of the first night, the <span>creation</span> of the clouds that came to be on the first day was brought to our attention, so too through the service of the wind, which is its breeze, Moses wished to make known to us the <span>creation</span> [ of the wind ]. For just as clouds do not exist without a shadow neither does wind exist without a breeze. It is in their service then that we notice those things that are not otherwise apparent to us. Therefore that wind was blowing because it was created for this purpose. After it blew and manifested its <span>creation</span> through its service on the first night, it became calm once again on the first day just as the clouds were dispersed once again on the first day. 
<p><a name="div01.8"></a>After Moses spoke of heaven and earth, of the darkness, the <span>abyss</span> and the wind that came to be at the beginning of the first night, he then turned to speak about the light that came to be at dawn of the first day. At the end of the twelve hours of that night, the light was created between the clouds and the waters and it chased away the shadow of the clouds that were overshadowing the waters and making them dark. For Nisan was the first month; in it the number of the hours of day and night were equal. The light, then, remained a length of twelve hours so that each day might also obtain its [ own ] hours just as the night possesses a measured length of time. Although the light and the clouds were created in the twinkling of an eye, the day and the night of the first day were each completed in twelve hours. 
<p>The light then was like a bright mist over the face of the earth. Whether it was like the dawn or like the pillar that gave light in the wilderness to the people, it is obvious that it was unable to chase away the darkness that was spread over the face of everything, unless it had spread out completely over everything, either by its substance or by its appearance. The light was released so that it might spread over everything without being fastened down. It dispersed the darkness that was over everything although it did not move. It was only when [ the light ] went away and when it came that it moved, so that when [ the light ] went away the rule was given to the night and at [ the light's ] coming there would be an end to [ the night's ] rule. 
<p><a name="div01.9"></a><a name="glossGen1:4,Gen1:5"></a>After the brightness [ of the light ] rendered its service for three days, lest, like nothing, it return to nothing, well did God bear witness concerning it by saying <i>"behold, it was very good." </i>[ Gen1:4 ] Although God did not [ actually ] say that the works that preceded the light were very beautiful, He did [ in fact ] say it about them, for though He did not say it of them in the beginning when only these things had come into existence out of nothing, He did say it of them after everything else had come into existence; for He included all that had been made together with all that was created in six days, when He said on the sixth day: <i>"God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good." </i>[ Gen1:31 ] 
<p>Because that first light was created good, it rendered its service by its brightness for three days and it also served, as we say, for the conception and the birth of everything that the earth brought forth on the third day. The sun was in the <span>firmament</span> in order to ripen whatever had sprouted forth under that first light. It is said that from this light and from the fire, which were both created on the first day, the sun, which was in the <span>firmament</span>, was fashioned, while the moon and the stars also came to be from that same first light. 
<p>Just as the sun which rules the day, by the fact that "it gives light to the earth", causes the fruits of the earth to ripen, so also does the moon which rules in the night, tempering the strength of the night by its brightness, also bring forth, according to its first nature, fruits and vegetation. For Moses speaks in his blessings of "the yield which the moon brought forth." Along with the other things on account of which the light was created, we say that the light was created on the first day for the sake of the things that were to come forth. After the earth brought forth everything during the course of the third day then there came [ the moon ] in the manner of the light on the fourth day, so that in the moon as well as in the light the beginning of all fruit might be found, and then through the sun all vegetation becomes ripe. 
<p><a name="div01.10"></a>It was through light, then, and through water that the earth brought forth everything. Even though God was able to bring forth everything from the earth without these things, it was His will to show that there was nothing that was created on earth that was not created for the purpose of man or for his service. 
<p>The waters that the earth drank on the first day were not salty. Even if they were like the deep on the surface of the earth, they were still not seas. For it was in the seas that these waters, which were not salty before being gathered together, became salty. When they were sent throughout the entire earth for the earth to drink they were sweet, but when they were gathered into seas on the third day, they became salty, lest they become stagnant due to their being gathered together and so that they might receive the rivers that enter into them without increasing. For the quantity that the seas require for nourishment is the measure of the rivers that flow down into them. The rivers flow down into the seas lest the heat of the sun dry them up. The saltiness [ of the seas ] then swallows up [ the rivers ] lest they increase, rise up and cover the earth. Thus the rivers turn into nothing, as it were, because the saltiness of the sea swallows them up. 
<p><a name="div01.11"></a>Even if the seas were created when the waters were created and were hidden in the waters, and the seas were bitter, the waters above them were not bitter. For just as in the flood there were seas, but they were covered over [ by those waters ], they were not able to change the sweet waters of the flood, which came from above, into their bitter nature, for if these waters had been bitter, how were the olives and all the plants preserved in them? How did those of the house of Noah and those with them drink from them? 
<p>Even if Noah had commanded that every food be brought for himself and those with him because there would be no food anywhere, he did not allow water to be brought because those who had entered the ark would be able to take the water from outside of the ark to drink. Therefore, just as the waters of the flood were not salty while the seas were hidden within them, neither were the waters that were gathered on the third day bitter even though the seas below them were bitter. 
<p><a name="div01.12"></a>Just as the gathering of the waters did not precede that word which said, <i>"Let the waters be gathered and let the dry land appear," </i>[ Gen1:9 ] neither did the seas exist until that moment when God "called the gathering of water 'seas'." When they received their name they were changed. In their [ new ] place the [ waters ] attained that saltiness which had not been theirs [ even ] outside of their [ old ] place. For their place became deep at that very moment when God said, <i>"Let the waters be gathered into one place." </i>[ Gen1:9 ] Then either the land [ that contained ] the sea was brought down below the [ level of the ] earth to receive within it its own waters along with the waters that were above the entire earth, or the waters swallowed each other so that the place might be sufficient for them, or the place of the sea shook and it became a great depth and the waters quickly hastened into that basin. Although the will of God had gathered these waters, when the earth was created, a gate was opened for thm to be gathered into one place. Just as in the gathering of the first and second waters there was found no gathering place because there was no place from which they might go out, so now do these waters come down with all the rains and showers and are gathered into seas along paths and roads which had been prepared for them on the first day. 
<p><a name="div01.13"></a>The upper waters, because they were separated on the second day from the lower waters by the <span>firmament</span> set between them, were also sweet like the lower waters (the upper waters are not those that became salty in the seas on the third day, but are those that were separated from them on the second day). They were not salty because they would not have become stagnant, for they had not been left on the land to become stagnant. The air there does not serve to cause [ things ] to grow or to swarm, nor do rivers flow into them to keep them from evaporating for there is no sun there to generate heat that would cause them to evaporate. They remain there for the dew of blessing and are kept there for the floodgates of wrath. 
<p>The waters that are above the <span>firmament</span> do not move about, because something made does not move about within something that is made, nor does something move about within nothing. But something that is created within something possesses, at its <span>creation</span>, all of that thing; that is, that thing moves, rises and falls within that thing in which it was created, but nothing surrounded the upper waters. Therefore, the upper waters were unable either to turn or to move about because they did not have something in which they might turn or move about. 
<p><a name="div01.14"></a>Heaven, earth, fire, wind and water were created from nothing as Scripture bears witness. But light, which came to be on the first day along with the rest of the things that came to be afterwards, came to be from something. For when these other things came to be from nothing, Moses said, "God created heaven and earth." Although it is not written concerning fire, water and wind that they were created, neither is it written that they were made. Therefore, they came to be from nothing just as heaven and earth came to be from nothing. 
<p><a name="div01.15"></a>After God began to make [things] from something, Moses wrote, "God said, 'Let there be'" light, and so on. Even though Moses did say, "God created the great serpents," still "let the waters swarm with swarming things" had been [ said ] prior to that. Therefore those five created things were created from nothing and everything else was made from those [ five ] things that came to be from nothing. 
<p>Fire was also created on the first day, although it is not written down that it was created, because it was in another element. It did not have its own existence, for it was created together with that thing in which it was. It is not possible that a thing which does not exist of itself can precede that thing which is the cause of its existence. That [ fire ] is in the earth, nature bears witness, but that it was not created together with the earth, scripture affirms, when it says, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." Fire then, since it does not exist of itself, remains with the earth, even if the wind and the clouds have been commanded at every moment to bring forth fire from their wombs along with the wind and the clouds. 
<p><a name="div01.16"></a>Darkness, too, is neither a self-subsistent being nor a created thing, but is a shadow, as scripture makes clear. It was created neither before heaven nor after the clouds, for it was with the clouds and was brought forth from the clouds. [ Darkness ] too exists in another [ thing ], for it has no substance of its own. When that in which it exists vanishes, the darkness likewise vanishes with it. For whatever comes to an end along with another thing when it vanishes is without its own existence, because that other thing is the cause of its existence. 
<p>So, how could darkness, whose existence is due to the clouds and to the <span>firmament</span> and not to the first light or to the sun, exist of itself? It is [ a thing ] which one thing, by its cover, brings forth and another, by its brightness, destroys. If one thing creates it and causes it to become something while another thing turns it back into nothing, how can it be a self-subsistent being? The clouds and the <span>firmament</span>, which were created at the beginning, bring it forth and the light that was created on the first day brings it to an end. If a created thing creates it and another created thing destroys it, and henceforth, one thing, at one moment, brings it into visibility and another, at that very moment itself turns back into nothing, turns it back into nothing, it is by compulsion that [ one thing ] causes it to begin and [ another thing ] causes it to go away. If created things cause it to come into existence and also cause it to vanish then it is a <span>creation</span> of creatures. [ The darkness then ] is but a shadow of the <span>firmament</span> and it is capable of vanishing in the presence of another thing, for it can be destroyed before the sun. Some teachings posit that this [ darkness ], which is at all times subject to created things, is an adversary of creatures, and they make that thing which has no substance of its own a self-existent being. 
<p><a name="div01.17"></a><a name="glossGen1:6,Gen1:7,Gen1:8"></a>After Moses spoke of those things that came to be on the first day, he began to write about those things that came to be on the second day, saying, <i>"And God said, 'Let there be a <span>firmament</span> between the waters and let it separate the waters below the <span>firmament</span> from the waters above the <span>firmament</span>.'" </i>[ Gen1:6 ] The <span>firmament</span> between the waters was pressed together from the waters. It was of the same measure as the waters that were spread out over the surface of the earth. Then if, in its origin, it was above the earth (for the earth, water and fire were beneath it, while water, wind and darkness were above it), how do others posit that this [ <span>firmament</span> ], which encloses this world within it like a child in the womb, was created in the middle of everything as the womb of everything? 
<p>If, on the other hand, the <span>firmament</span> had been created as the center of everything, light, darkness and wind, which were above the <span>firmament</span> when it was created, would have been confined above the <span>firmament</span>. If the <span>creation</span> [ of the <span>firmament</span> ] had occurred at night, the darkness and wind would also have remained there together with the waters which remained there. But if the <span>creation</span> [ of the <span>firmament</span> ] had occurred in the day, the light and the wind also would have remained there along with the waters. And if the [ wind, water and lights ] had remained there then the [ wind, water and lights ] here would be other things. When, then, could the [ wind, water and lights ] have been created? If, however, they did not remain there, how did those elements that were above [ the <span>firmament</span> ] when they were created move below it? 
<p><a name="div01.18"></a>The <span>firmament</span> was created on the evening of the second night, just as the heavens came to be on the evening of the first night. But when the <span>firmament</span> came into existence, the covering of clouds that had served for a night and a day in the place of the <span>firmament</span> dissipated. Because [ the <span>firmament</span> ] had been created between the light and the darkness, no darkness remained above it, for the shadow of the clouds was dispelled when the clouds themselves were dispelled. Nor did any of this light remain there, for its alotted measure of time had come to an end and so it sank into the waters that were beneath [ the <span>firmament</span> ]. 
<p>The wind could not have remained there, either, because it did not even exist there. It was on the first night that Moses said "it hovered" and not on the second night. If the <span>firmament</span> had been created on the first night when [ the wind ] was blowing there could then be some debate. But, since it is not written that [ the wind ] was blowing when the <span>firmament</span> was created, who would say that the wind was there when Scripture does not say so? 
<p><a name="div01.19"></a>After the wind hovered on the first day, manifested its service by its blowing and returned to its stillness, then the <span>firmament</span> came to be. It is evident, therefore, that [ the wind ] neither remained above nor descended below, for how can one seek in any place or spot for something whose very substance only exists at the moment of its service and whose service comes to an end when it ceases to blow? The wind underwent three things on the day of its <span>creation</span>: it was created from nothing, it blew in and through something, and it reverted to being hidden in its stillness. 
<p><a name="div01.20"></a>After the wind had undergone these three things, the <span>firmament</span> was created on the evening of the second day. There was then nothing that rose along with it, because there was nothing that remained above it. It made a separation between the waters that it was commanded to separate, but not between the light, the wind or darkness, for this had not been commanded. 
<p>There was no light, therefore, on the first night. On the night of the second and third day, it sank into the waters beneath the <span>firmament</span> and sprang forth as we said [ above ]. But on the fourth day, when the waters were gathered into one place, they say that the <span>firmament</span> was formed and that the sun, the moon, and the stars were formed from the <span>firmament</span> and from fire, and there were places set apart for the lights. The moon would rise in the west of the <span>firmament</span>, the sun in the east, and at the same moment, the stars were dispersed in orderly fashion throughout the entire <span>firmament</span>. 
<p>Although God said about the light that came to be on the first day that "it was very good," He did not say this about the <span>firmament</span> which came to be on the second day, because the <span>firmament</span> had not yet been finished, neither in its structure nor in its adornment. The Creator delayed until the lights came to be so that when [ the <span>firmament</span> ] was adorned with the sun and the moon and the stars, and the strength of the darkness that was weakened by the lights shining from it, He would then say of the <span>firmament</span> as well as of [ the rest of <span>creation</span> ] that "it was very good." 
<p><a name="div01.21"></a><a name="glossGen1:9,1:10"></a>After Moses spoke of the <span>firmament</span>, which came to be on the second day, he then turned to write about the gathering of the waters and about the grass and the trees that the earth brought forth on the third day, saying, <i>"And God said, 'Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.'" </i>[ Gen1:9 ] From the fact that He said, "Let the waters be gathered into one place," it is evident that it was the earth which bore the waters and that the abysses were not standing on nothing beneath the earth. Although the waters were gathered in the night at the word of God, the surface of the earth still became dry in the twinkling of an eye. 
<p><a name="div01.22"></a><a name="glossGen1:11,Gen1:12,Gen1:13"></a>After these two things had occurred, He commanded the earth to bring forth at dawn " <i>grass and herbs </i>[ Gen1:11 ] of every kind and all the various fruit-bearing trees. Although the grasses were only a moment old at their <span>creation</span>, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like [ trees ] years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches. 
<p>The grass that would be required as food for the animals who were to be created two days later was [ thus ] made ready. And the new corn that would be food for Adam and his descendants, who would be thrown out of Paradise four days later, was [ thus ] prepared. 
<p><a name="div01.23"></a><a name="glossGen1:14,Gen1:15,Gen1:16,Gen1:17,Gen1:18,Gen1:19"></a>After Moses spoke about the gathering of the waters and about the sprouting of the vegetation on the earth on the third day, he turned to write about the lights that were created in the <span>firmament</span> saying, <i>"And God said, 'Let there be lights in the <span>firmament</span> of the heavens to separate the day from the night'," </i>[ Gen1:14 ] that is, one to rule over the day and the other [ to rule ] over the night. 
<p>That [ God ] said, <i>"Let them be for signs," </i>[ Gen1:14 ] [ refers to ] measures of time, and "let them be for seasons," clearly indicates summer and winter. "Let them be for days," are measured by the rising and setting of the sun, and "let them be for years," are comprised of the daily cycles of the sun and the monthly cycles of the moon. 
<p>Indeed Moses said, <i>"God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and [ He made ] the stars." </i>[ Gen1:16 ] Although all that was done before the fourth day was begun in the evening, the works on the fourth day were fashioned at dawn. Because the third day had been completed, in that it is said, "It was evening and it was morning; day three," God did not create the two lights in the evening lest night be changed into day and morning be given priority over evening. 
<p><a name="div01.24"></a>Because the days followed the same order in which the first day was created, the night of the fourth day, like that of the other days, preceded its day. And if its evening preceded its dawn, the lights were not created in the evening, but rather at dawn. But to say that one of them was created in the evening and the other at dawn cannot be allowed for Moses said, "Let there be lights," and "God made the two great lights." If they were great when they were created and they were created at dawn, then the sun would have stood in the east and the moon opposite it in the west. The sun would have been set very low because it was created in the place where it set out over the earth, whereas the moon would have been set higher because it was created in the place where it stands on the fifteenth day. Indeed, at the moment the sun appears over the earth, the lights see each other and then the moon sinks. From the position of the moon, from its size and from the light it produced, it is clear, then, that it was fifteen days old when it was created. 
<p><a name="div01.25"></a>Just as the trees, the vegetation, the beasts, the birds and even mankind were old, so were they also young. They were old according to the appearance of their limbs and their substances, yet they were young because of the hour and moment of their <span>creation</span>. Likewise, the moon was both old and young. It was young, for it was but a moment old, but was also old, for it was full as it is on the fifteenth day. 
<p>If the moon had been created a day old or even two, it would have given no light; because of its proximity to the sun, it would not even have been visible. If it had been created about four days old, although it might have been visible, it would still not have given any light. This would have rendered false the verse <i>"God created the two great lights," </i>as well as "He said, <i>'Let there be lights in heaven to give light upon the earth.'" </i>Therefore, the moon had to be fifteen days old. The sun, although it was only one day old, was nevertheless four days old, for it is according to the sun that each day was counted and will be reckoned. Accordingly, those eleven days that were added to the moon at that first moment, by which the moon was older than the sun, are also added to it each year, for these [ days ] are used in the lunar reckoning. 
<p>There was nothing lacking in that year for Adam and his descendants, for any deficiency in the measure of the moon had been filled in when the moon was created. Thus, Adam and his descendants learned from this year that, henceforth, eleven days were to be added to every year. Clearly then, it was not the Chaldeans who arranged the times and years; these things had been arranged before [ the <span>creation</span> of ] Adam. 
<p><a name="div01.26"></a><a name="glossGen1:20,Gen1:21,Gen1:22,Gen1:23"></a>After Moses spoke about the lights that came to be in the <span>firmament</span>, he turned to write about the swarming things, the birds and the serpents that were created from the waters on the fifth day, saying, <i>"And God said, 'Let the waters cause living things to swarm, and let the birds fly above the earth.' And God created the great serpents and every living creature with which the waters swarmed according to their kind." </i>[ Gen1:20,1:21 ] 
<p>When the waters were gathered, which had been ordered on the second day, the rivers were ordered and also springs, lakes, and ponds were revealed. At the word of God, these waters--dispersed throughout <span>creation</span>--brought forth swarming things and fish from within them: the serpents were created within the abysses and the birds soared in flocks out of the waves into the air. As for the great serpents that were created, although the prophets said that Leviathan dwelt in the sea, Job said that the Behemoth dwelt on dry land. David too, speaking of this beast, says that "on a thousand mountains is Behemoth's pasture land," that is "His place of repose." Perhaps it was after they were created that their places were separated so that Leviathan should dwell in the sea and Behemoth on dry land. 
<p><a name="div01.27"></a><a name="glossGen1:24,Gen1:25"></a>After Moses spoke about the <span>creation</span> of the swarming things and of the birds and the sea serpents on the fifth day, he turned to write about the creeping things and the animals and the beasts that were created on the sixth day, saying, <i>"And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and reptiles and beasts.'" </i>[ Gen1:24 ] Although the entire earth was swarming with swarming things, nevertheless the cattle and the beasts were made on the border of Paradise so that they might dwell at the appointed place of Adam. , 
<p>Then the entire earth stirred with creeping things as it had been commanded. The earth also brought forth the beasts of the field as companions to the wild beasts, and it brought forth as many beasts as would be useful for the service of that one who, on that very day, was to transgress the commandment of his Lord. 
<p><a name="div01.28"></a><a name="glossGen1:26"></a>After Moses spoke about the reptiles, the cattle and the beasts that were created on the sixth day, he turned to write about the <span>creation</span> of that man who was fashioned on the sixth day, saying, <i>"And God said [Let us create man. . .]" </i>[ Gen1:26 ] But to whom was God speaking? Here as well as in every place where He creates, it is clear that He was speaking to His Son. The Evangelist said about Him that <i>"everything came to be through Him and without Him not one thing came to be." </i>[ John1:1 ] Paul also attests to Him saying, <i>"In Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, all that is visible and all that is invisible." </i>[ Col1:15 ] 
<p><a name="div01.29"></a><i>"And God said, 'Let us make man in our image." </i>[ Gen1:26 ] According to what has been said up to this point, he is able, as it pleases him, to interpret for us: Moses explains ["in our image"] as follows <i>"Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds, and over the cattle, and over all the earth." </i>[ Gen1:26 ] It is the dominion that Adam received over the earth and over all that is in it that constitutes the likeness of God who has dominion over the heavenly things and the earthly things. 
<p><a name="glossGen1:27"></a>Then Moses said, <i>"male and female He created them," </i>[ Gen1:27 ] to make known that Eve was inside Adam, in the rib that was drawn out from him. Although she was not in his mind she was in his flesh, she was in his flesh with him, and she was also in soul and spirit with him, for God added nothing to that rib that He took out except the structure and the adornment. If everything that was suitable for Eve, who came to be from the rib, was complete from the rib alone, it is well said that "male and female He created them." 
<p><a name="div01.30"></a><a name="glossGen1:28"></a><i>"And God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds and over every animal that crawls upon the earth.'" </i>[ Gen1:28 ] Because they were blessed on this earth, it is as if this dwelling spot had been prepared for them prior to their sin. For although they had not yet sinned God knew that they were about to sin. 
<p><i>"Be fruitful and multiply and fill," </i>[ ] not Paradise but <i>"the earth," </i>[ Gen1:28 ] and <i>"have dominion over the fish of the sea and the birds and over all the beasts." </i>[ Gen1:28 ] But how was Adam to rule over the fish of the sea unless he were in proximity to the sea? And how was he to rule over the birds that fly throughout every region unless his descendants were to dwell in every region? And how was Adam to rule over every beast of the earth unless his offspring inhabited the entire earth? 
<p><a name="div01.31"></a>Although Adam was created and was blessed to rule over the earth and over everything that was created and blessed in [ the earth ], God had indeed made him to dwell within Paradise. God truly manifested His fore-knowledge in His blessings and manifested His grace in the place in which He caused Adam to dwell. Lest it be said that Paradise was not created for [ Adam's ] sake, God made him dwell there in Paradise. And lest it be said that God did not know that Adam would sin, He blessed him on this earth. And everything with which God blessed Adam preceded the transgression of the commandment, lest by the transgression of him who had been blessed, the blessings of Him who gives blessing be withheld and the world be turned back into nothing on account of the folly of that one for whose sake everything had been created. 
<p>Within Paradise, therefore, God did not bless Adam because that place and all that was in it is blessed. But God blessed him on the earth first so that by the blessing with which [ His ] grace blessed beforehand, the curse of the earth, which was about to be cursed by [ His ] justice, might [ thus ] be diminished. But even though it was a blessing of promise, in that it was fulfilled after his expulsion from Paradise, it was, nevertheless, His grace that was effected, for on that same day, God made Adam dwell in the garden, clothed him with glory and made him ruler over all the trees of Paradise. </p>

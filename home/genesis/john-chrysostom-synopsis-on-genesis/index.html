formation of man. Adam receives a command; the woman is formed of one of her
ribs; the snake deceives her; she deceives the man herself, and, cursed with
him, is driven from Paradise with him. The serpent is cursed; he will crawl on
his stomach. Cain kills his brother because he is preferred, he receives the
punishment; then he begets children. Eve gives birth to Seth. List of the
descendants of Adam and Seth to Noah, and reproaches that men incur for their
criminal marriages, at the same time as for their iniquities. The sons of God,
these are the names of those who have their origin in Seth (Gen. VI, 2),
because here is what is written: "I said: you are gods, you are all the
sons of the Most -Top. (LXXXI, 6.) The daughters of men are the descendants of
Cain. God announces to Noah the ruin of the human race by the flood, and orders
him to build the ark, three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits high, and thirty
cubits high. When he entered the ark, the deluge occurs for forty days and
forty nights. Water remains on the earth for a hundred and fifty days, and the
peaks of the mountains appear on the first day. the tenth month. After forty
days, Noah sends the horn. water (he does not return, and seven days later he
sends the dove back carrying an olive branch.) God orders Noah to leave the
ark, when he comes out, he offers God a sacrifice and he is blessed He receives
from God the promise that men will no longer perish by a deluge, then he
blesses Seni and Japheth, but curses Chanaan because Chain, whose son he was,
revealed the nakedness of his son. This curse was performed on the Gibeonites,
and, to tell the truth, it had the appearance of a (525) curse, but in reality
it was a prophecy. List of Noah's descendants to Phaleg, to whom this name was
given because the earth was divided by the time it was lived in. Then was built
the tower in the place that was called Babylon, that is, confusion, because in
this place there was confusion, tongues. Eber, father of Phaleg, did not
consent, said, to build the tower with the others and for this there, his
language was not changed; but he kept his idiom intact, and even imposed his
name upon it. It was called Heber, its language was Hebrew, and so it is proved
that the Hebrew idiom is the oldest language. This language was the one
everyone used before the confusion.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Abraham. Genealogy of the descendants of Seth until Abraham. Tarthe, father of
Abraham, takes with him his sons Abraham and Nachor and Lot, his grandson, and
comes to the land of Charran, having resolved to dwell in the land of Chanaan.
Taken dead, Abraham receives from God the order to leave the land of Charran
and he goes to Shechem, in the land of Chanaan. God promises him to give this
land to his race. Abraham raises an altar to God and sets his tent towards the
sea. A famine having arisen, he goes to Egypt, ordering his wife to say that
she is his sister. But Pharaoh removes it and, taken over by God, gives it back
to Abraham. The leaders of the flocks of Abraham and Lot argue, and they cease
to live with each other. Lotte stays in the land of Sodom and Abraham near the
oak of Mamre, where God renews his promises to him, affirming that he will
multiply his race and give it this country for inheritance. Now when five kings
of the land of Sodom had rebelled against Chodorlahomor, whom they had
previously obeyed, he took with him three other kings and made war against
them; he put them to flight and took prisoners, among whom was Lot. However,
Abraham having known it, he pursued the conqueror with three hundred and
eighteen of the servants in his house, and took the son of his brother with the
horses and the women. He is blessed by Melchizedek, who comes to meet him with
bread and wine, and gives him tithes. This is why Paul said in the epistle to
Hebrews that Levi who receives tithing himself paid tithing. He does not
acquiesce at the request of the king of Sodom, who begged him to keep the
horses for his part, "so that you can not say," he said: enriched
Abraham. (Gen. XIV, 23.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Abraham, "Your reward will be great (Genesis XV, 1)," he complains of
having no children. God speaks to him a second time; he tells him that he who
comes out of him will inherit his inheritance, and that his race will be like
the stars of the firmament. It is in this place that it is said: "Abraham
believed in the word of God and his faith was imputed to him for righteousness.
He divides the flesh of the victims, and he learns that his race will be
reduced to slavery, and that afterwards it will be delivered after it has been
humiliated for four hundred years. Sarah, who was barren, gives Hagar to
Abraham to have children of her. The latter having conceived, took pride in her
mistress, and Abraham delivered her to Sara to punish her insolence. Hagar,
ill-treated by Sara, fled from her home: an angel orders her to return to her
mistress, promises him that her race will be numerous and, before the child is
born, gives him a name, calling him Ishmael. Hagar gives birth to Ishmael, and
Abraham, ninety-nine years old, changes his name: he ceases to be called Abram
and his name is Abraham. God orders him to circumcise himself and with him all
his house. Sara also changes her name and is called Sarra. The birth of Isaac
is promised to Abraham. The Son of God appeared to him with two angels and said
to him, "I will return to you in this time and at this time, and your wife
Sara will have a son. (Gen. XVIII, 10.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

people of Sodom. Two angels will find Lot. The inhabitants of Sodom pursue them
and are blinded. The angels, taking Lot, come out of the house, and he himself
takes refuge in Segor with his daughters, while his wife is changed into a
statue of salt because she turned to look behind her. While Sodom was on fire,
Lot withdrew to the mountain, and his two daughters conceived of him; the
oldest gave birth to Moab and the youngest to Ammon: they had conceived after
intoxicating their father, because they thought that all the race of men had
perished.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

live in the land of Gerare, and the king of that land, Abimelech, removed
Sarra. The king having heard the (526) threats of God justifies himself by

with Abraham an alliance, they swear not to harm one another; Abimelech
receives seven young sheep in testimony before the well of the oath, that all

bought a tomb of Hephron the Hittite and buried his wife. Then he sends his
servant to bring a son of Mesopotamia for his son Isaac, advising him not to
bring him to this country if the woman refuses to come with him. When the
servant arrived in the city inhabited by Nachor, he asked God to let him know
by a sign the girl he was coming for, and this sign was that she would give him
water to drink for him and for him. his camels. Rebekah, daughter of Bathuel, who
himself was the son of Nahor, introduced himself. Now, Nachor was Abraham's
brother. The girl gave drink to the servant and the camels; she said of whom
she was a daughter, and she led the man and she gave him hospitality. He said
why he had come and asked the girl; but his parents left him to answer. She
consented; the servant took her away and she was Isaac's wife.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

conceived in her bosom, God said to her, "Two nations are in your bosom;
one people will dominate the other (Gen. XXV, 23), "wanting to announce
what was to happen to Jews and Christians. She gave birth to the children, who
grew up, and Esau sold Jacob his birthrights for a dish of lentils. A famine
occurred; but when Isaac thought of going to Egypt he was prevented from doing
so by God, who commanded him to abide in the place where he was, promising to
be with him, to bless his race, and to multiply it. Abimelech, king of Gerare, knowing
that Rebekah was Isaac's wife (for he had thought at first that she was his
sister), threatened with death anyone who offended him. Isaac sowed a field and
the grain made one hundred to one. When he had acquired great riches by the
blessing of God, the Philistines envied him, and Abimelech compelled him to go
away. He did not resist, but he went and dug wells; however, quarrels were made
for these wells. Isaac did not try to fight back; he dug more wells until they
stopped quarreling. God blessed him, and Isaac welcomed with kindness Abimelech
who came to him; he fled for a meal, not remembering the insults he had
received.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Chananne women who were always in a quarrel with Rebecca. But Isaac had become
old. He commanded his son Esau to go hunting and prepare food for him to bless
him. Jacob advised by his mother, estranged Esau. Having cooked two kids,
Rebekah used their skins to disguise Jacob, then she put the food prepared by
her and sent it to her. Jacob approached his father and received his blessings.
Esau returned; he learned what had happened; he lamented and groaned, also
asking for blessings. His perseverance was not disappointed; He did not get
everything he hoped for, but he did. Having received a lesser blessing, instead
of the greater one, he was angry with his brother, and remained resentful while
awaiting the death of his father, in order to secure his vengeance. Jacob's
mother warned him and advised him to seek safety in the escape. She tells Isaac
that life will become unbearable to him if Jacob also takes a woman from among
the Chananeans and arranges for the father to send him to Mesopotamia in Laban,
his brother, to take one of his daughters as his wife. When he left, Esau took
as his wife a daughter of Ishmael, who himself was the son of Abraham and
Hagar.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Jacob indignant at this deception seven more years of service if he wants to

gave him Zelpha, who was his slave, and she gave birth to Gad and Asher. Then
Lia gave birth to Issachar and Zabulon. Rachel, in turn, became Joseph's
mother. When Jacob had decided to return to his country, Laban granted him the
reward that Jacob himself had determined, all the brown lambs and all the white
goats. Both were in great numbers, for Jacob put sticks in the places where the
ewes were to drink, and they gave birth to small ones, some white, others
varied and spotted dark. Everything was God's work, as Jacob says. Laban's sons
were envious of him, so, having secretly taken his wives and all he possessed,
he went away. Laban pursued him, but before he could reach him, God made him
understand the threats that were to be made if he mistreated Jacob. Having
reached Jacob, Laban accused him and asked him why he had gone in secret. Jacob
replied that it was because of his envy and because he feared that Laban would
restrain his daughters. But he sought his gods whom Rachel had taken, he did
not find them, and he addressed violent reproaches to Jacob. Finally, after
they had eaten and drunk, they raised a heap of stones which they called the
monument of testimony, and they went each one on his side.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

coming and shares his troop, he first puts the slaves with their children, then
Lia with his children, then Rachel last with Joseph. For him, he walked
forward. Esau welcomed him, received his presents, and asked to go with him,
but Jacob refused the offer and went to Salem, the city of the Sichemites,
where-Sichem, the son of King Emmor, inflamed with love for Dina's daughter
Jacob and having done violence asked her to take her for a wife. Simeon and
Levi replied that this marriage could take place if he and his people were
circumcised. When they were circumcised, while they were still in the pains of
circumcision, Sin} eon and Levi put them to death. Then Jacob feared that the
neighboring Canaanites would melt on him, and he withdrew to Bethel by the

him because of his dreams and because his father loved him more. Having seized
him when he was alone, they wanted to kill him. Ruben advised them to throw him
into a cistern, for he had resolved to save him from death. He was cast there,
and sold to the Midianites according to the counsel of Judah. They showed their
father his tunic dipped in blood, and he, thinking that he had fallen prey to a
ferocious beast, wept bitterly. The children of Judah were Her, Onan and Sela.
Dead hero, Onan, his brother, took with him Thamar wife of this one, but he did
not want to raise a child to his brother. He died himself, and Judah did not
want to give Thamar as wife to Sela, his third son. Thamar, dressed up, sat
down along the road like a courtesan. Thinking (528) that she really was a
courtesan, because she had hidden her face, Judah had trade with her and gave
her a collar, a ring and her staff as a deposit. When he heard later that
Thamar was pregnant, Judah, who was his father-in-law, ordered her to be burned
at a stake. This one sent one who said that she had conceived by the work of
the man to whom that ring was, and Judah exclaimed: "Thamar acted with
more justice than me. "(Gen. XXXVIII, 26.) When she was born, Zara passed
her hand first and pulled her away, and then Pharès was born and Zara was born.
Now, here is the allegorical explanation of this fact. The first righteous men
who lived before the law passed their hand, that is to say they showed a life
adorned with virtues and worthy of angels. Then it was the law regime. Then,
again, the first life of the just righteous reappeared, carried by Christ to a
greater degree of perfection.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

bought Joseph and entrusted him with all the things that were in his house.
Joseph did not consent to the desire of his mistress to make him sin. She
slanders him, he is thrown into the prison. There, too, he is raised above the
others: he explains the dreams of the baker and the butler. He came according
to his word; one was put to death, the other restored to his first charge.
Pharaoh sees in dreams the cows and the ears, which foresaw abundance and
famine. Joseph is taken from prison to interpret the dream, because the
cupbearer had reported it to the king. He gave the interpretation and also the
advice that could bring a cure to the famine. He is established first after
Pharaoh; he collects a great abundance of wheat during the seven years of
abundance, and when the famine occurs, he sells wheat to those who want it. His
brothers come to buy some. He does not see Benjamin with them, and fears that
they have killed him. He accuses them of being spies, and says that there is no
other way of justifying this accusation than to bring Benjamin, their youngest
brother, to Egypt, and to show it to him. He takes Simeon as hostage and holds
him prisoner; he sends back the others and gives them wheat and money. But when
they saw the money, opening the bags, they were troubled by this unexpected
fact. They asked Benjamin for their father, telling him everything that had
happened. Jacob refused to let the child go. The famine continued to rage. Judah
insisted on taking Benjamin, promising to bring him back safe and sound, and
Jacob gave double the money, again recommending other gifts.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

they were welcomed by him with benevolence; he asked them about their father
and made them a big feast. When they left, Joseph ordered to put a gold cup in
the bag of Benjamin, without the knowledge of all. The cup being set, they went
away, carrying away the whole thing. Joseph told the intendant of his house to
pursue these men, and. the latter having met them reproached them for rewarding
the benefits by bad actions. They were troubled and said that any of them who
were found guilty of theft would be worthy of death, and that the others would
remain slaves. Now the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. Then Judah appeared
before Joseph, spoke to him at length about their father, Joseph and Benjamin,
offering to be a slave in his place, and he so excited Joseph's pity that
everything was discovered. Having dismissed everyone so that he could shed tears
freely, Joseph made himself known to his brothers and sent them to their father
with considerable gifts and carts. Pharaoh had given his consent to all this.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">When Jacob heard all that
pertained to Joseph, he was filled with joy, and by the command of God he
surrendered. in Egypt. Joseph saw his father again and told Pharaoh that
Rameses was their dwelling place. However all the money of the country was
exhausted. The inhabitants paid the corn with their flocks, and when they had
no more, and the famine continued, they surrendered themselves with their
lands. As Pharaoh's slaves, they sowed the land and bore him one-fifth of the
harvest, keeping four other shares for them. On the point of death, Jacob made
promise to Joseph, by oath, that he would not bury him in Egypt, but in the
tomb of his fathers. Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, were put by him,
not to the rank of his grandsons, but to the rank of his own sons. Jacob's
sight had weakened. He had kissed Joseph's sons and was going to bless them. Joseph
had placed Ephraim on the left (529) of Jacob and Manasseh on the right. But
Jacob placed his right hand on the youngest, who was on his left, and the left
hand on the one on his right, and he blessed them. Joseph, thinking that he
acted out of ignorance, and wishing to remedy it, Jacob did not suffer him, and
said that he had acted knowingly; not out of ignorance. And he gave to Joseph
the city of Shechem, which was not divided, which was taken by Simeon and Levi.
He blessed all his children and prophesied concerning the coming of Christ.
"The prince shall not go out of Judah," said he, "the leader of
the people shall not go out of his race before the coming of the One who is
expected. (Gen. XLIX, 10.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Joseph wept for him and, taking away his bones, he buried him in the cave of
Abraham. His brethren then said to each other, "Perhaps he will remember
the injury we have done to him and will do us the evil done to him (Gen. L,
15)," and they implored him saying: "Here we are your slaves. (Ibid,
L, 18) Joseph began to cry and answered: "Do not be afraid, for it is God
who has done everything. You have formed criminal projects, but God has favored
me with his property. I will feed you and your families. Joseph lived one
hundred years, and saw the children of Ephraim until the third generation. He
spoke. so to his brethren: "God will visit you and he will bring you into
the land of promise which he promised with an oath to give to our fathers. You
will then carry with you my bones. (Ibid., 24.) And being dead, at the age of
one hundred, he was buried in Egypt.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

certain swiftness the Sacred Scriptures called canonical and compared the
translations with other manuscripts that were adjusted to the version of the
Septuagint, it seemed useful to us to gather in a writing some questions that
came to mind so that we would not forget. It was already a matter of
remembering them briefly, and only of proposing them even with some detail, and
of solving them in some way, even if very quickly. It was not a question of
explaining them exhaustively, but of being able to take a look when we needed
to do it, or to check what we still had to investigate, or to be not only ready
to think, but also prepared to respond, according to our possibilities, from
what seemed to us already sufficiently investigated.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">So, if there is someone
who does not mind reading these pages because of my careless style because of
the haste with which I have written them, if you find problems proposed and not
solved, do not think that there is nothing useful in this writing. For a part
of the investigation is to know what one should investigate. And whatever the
explanation of the issues, do not despise the simple style, but rather be glad
to have some participation in the doctrine that is contained, because we do not
seek the truth to discuss, but we discuss to seek the truth.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

be treated in many ways, and of which I have already spoken in another place,
according to my options, here are the topics that I wanted to put in writing,
as they were presented to me as I read them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

DID CAIN BUILD A CITY? — We may wonder how Cain could found a city, if a city
is made up of a certain number of men, and instead it is said in Scripture that
there were only two fathers and two sons, that one brother killed the other,
and then adds that another son was born to occupy the place of the one that had
been assassinated. Perhaps the problem arises precisely because the readers of
the text think that at that time there were only those two men who Holy
Scripture recalls and do not notice that the two who were born first or even
those whom they begot lived so long that they begot many others. Indeed, Adam
himself did not beget only those whose names we read in Scripture. For the
Scripture, when it speaks of him, ends by saying that he begot sons and
daughters (Cf. Gen. 5:4). Therefore, since these men lived many more years than

They also often ask how angels could have sex with the daughters of men, of
whom the giants are said to have been born, although some manuscripts, not only
Latin but also Greek, read not of the angels, but of the sons of God. To solve
this question some have claimed that they were just men, and so it could also
be said of them that they were angels. Scripture, for example, says about John,
who was a man: Behold, I send my angel before you to prepare your way. (Mt.

the problem is knowing how giants were born through sex of men, or how they

the giants, that is to say, very large and very strong men, I think that there
is nothing strange in that they could have been born of men, because even after
the flood they existed; as a matter of fact, in our own day there have also
been some individual humans incredibly large, not only men but also women. It
is therefore more credible that righteous men, called angels, or sons of God,
(Cf. Gen. 6:2) moved by lust, sinned with women, instead of angels, who could
not commit that sin because they lack bodies; although certain demons have been
evil with women, so many things are said and by so many people, that it is not

hundred years</i>, or, as the Greek says: <i>three
hundred years</i>, the question arises as to how God said to Noah: And the
years of life of them a hundred and twenty years (Gen 6:3), for Arphaxad was
not yet born when God said that, nor was he in the ark with his fathers. How,
then, are we to understand the aforementioned one hundred and twenty years of
human life, since there is a man who lived more than four hundred? The passage
must be interpreted as meaning that twenty years before the beginning of the
construction of the ark, a building that lasted for a hundred years, God said
this to Noah, pre-announcing to him already that he would send the flood and
that he did not predict the time of human life of men that were to be born
after the flood, but the time of the human life of men that he would annihilate

WAS ABRAHAM ESTABLISHED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN? <a name="_Hlk488933987"><font color="#000000">— </font></a>How
is it that the Scripture says that Terah, the father of Abram, fathered Abram
at the age of seventy and then remained with all his people in Harran and lived
two hundred and five years in Harran and died, and that the Lord commanded
Abram to come out of Harran, (Cf. Gen. 12:1-4) and he went out, Abraham being
seventy-five years old? The answer would be that the Scripture says as a
recapitulation that the Lord spoke while Terah was still alive, Abram left
Harran, according to the command of the Lord, at the age of seventy-five years,
when his father was one hundred and forty-five, if the years of his father's
life were two hundred and five, so it is written that the years of Terah's life
were two hundred and five in Harran, because he lived all his years there. The
question, therefore, is solved by way of recapitulation; for it would remain
unresolved if we consider that after the death of Terah the Lord commanded
Abram to leave Harran because he could not be only seventy-five years old when
his father died, who begat him at seventy, so Abram would be a hundred and
thirty years old, after the death of his father, if all that he lived were two
hundred and five. In summary, if one takes into account this type of
recapitulation that Scripture uses, many problems that otherwise appear
mysterious are solved, as we have said above with respect to other questions
that we have also solved by appealing to it (recapitulation). However, there
are others who solve the problem differently, saying that Abram's years of life
are calculated from the moment he was released from the fire of the Chaldeans,
in which he was cast out for not worshiping it (the fire) according to their
superstition. And although the Scripture does not say that he was freed from
that fire, we recall it from Jewish tradition. The problem may be solved as
follows: The text that says: When Terah was seventy-five years old he begot
Abram, Nahor, and Haran, (Gen. 11:26) it does not mean, of course, that he
begat all three at the age of seventy; the Scripture recalls the year from
which he began to have children. But it may be that Abram was later begotten,
and because of his excellency, which is frequently advanced in Scripture, he
was mentioned earlier, just as the prophet first mentioned the younger one: I
loved Jacob and hated Esau (Mal. 1:2-3). And in the book of Chronicles, Juda is
mentioned first, in spite of occupying the fourth place in the order of birth,
because it is he who gives the name to the Jewish stock because his tribe was
the royal tribe (Cf. 1 Chron. 4:1). In short, to solve the difficult questions
there are certainly different solutions. It is necessary to take into account,
of course, Stephen's account (Cf. Acts 7:2-3) on this subject, to see which of
these expositions agrees more. And this, of course, compels us not to think, as
Genesis (Cf. Gen. 12:1) seems to indicate, that God commanded Abram to leave
his family and his father's house after the death of Terah, but to understand
that, being in Mesopotamia before living in Harran, God spoke to him during
that journey, once he had obviously left the land of the Chaldeans. But what
Stephen says: Then Abram, coming out of the land of the Chaldeans, dwelt in
Harran, and then after his father was dead, he removed him into this land (Acts
7:4); he presents no small difficulties to this explanation, which is based in
a kind of recapitulation. For it seems that he received the commandment of the
Lord, who had spoken to him on the journey from Mesopotamia, after he had come
out of the land of the Chaldeans and when he went to Harran, and that after his
father's death he truly obeyed this command, when it is said: And he dwelt in
Harran. And then, when his father died, he removed him into this land.
Therefore, it continues the problem of how it may be true that he was
seventy-five when he left Harran, as is clearly stated in the text of Genesis.
Perhaps the words of Stephen: Then Abram came out of the land of the Chaldeans
and dwelt in Harran, not to be understood thus: He went forth, after the Lord
had spoken to him, for he was already in Mesopotamia, as was said before, when
he heard that from the Lord. But Stephen, with that rule of recapitulation,
wanted to unite both things and say at the same time where he had come from and
where he dwelt, when he added: Then Abram left the land of the Chaldeans and
dwelt in Harran. God spoke to him at the middle, that is, between the departure
from the land of the Chaldeans and their settlement in Harran. Afterwards,
however, Stephen adds: And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed
him into this land; it is to be noted that he did not say: And after his
father's death he left Harran, but: Then God set him in this land, so that he
was put in the land of Canaan after dwelling in Harran. He did not leave after
the death of his father, but was placed in the land of Canaan after the death
of his father, so that the order of the words are: Dwell in Harran, and then
put him in this land after the death of his father. So it must be understood
that Abram was put or placed in the land of Canaan when he received that
offspring, whose whole descendants would reign there, according to the promise
that God made, to give to him the land as an inheritance. For there was born of
Abram himself, Ishmael, the son of Hagar. There also were born the children of
Ketura, to whom the inheritance of that land would not belong. Esau was also
born of Isaac, (Cf. Gen. 25:25; 29:32-35; 30:5) who was also deprived of that
inheritance. But all the sons who were born to Jacob, son of Isaac, that is,
all his offspring belonged to that inheritance. Therefore, if one correctly
understands the fact that Abram was put and placed in that land because he
lived until Jacob's birth, the problem is solved through a recapitulation,
although other solutions cannot be rejected either.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 25]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Here is the question of how God's promise to Abram and his offspring is
understood to give him as much land as he could look with his eyes toward the
four key points. For how much land can your body's eyes encompass in your
vision? But the problem disappears if we realize that this was not promised
only, since God did not say: I will give you as much land as you see, but: I
will give you the land which you see. For as there was also land after all,
evidently it was given above all that which was seen. In addition, we must pay
attention to what follows. For in order that Abram himself did not think that
only the land which he could see or behold about him was promised to him, God
said to him, "Arise and walk the earth far and wide, for I will give it to
you," (Gen. 13:17) because if he stood in one place he could not see with
his eyes alone. With these words is indicated the land that the first people of
Israel received, who were descendants of Abram according to the flesh, not the
offspring that is more widespread according to faith. In order that he would
not forget, he was told that it would be like the sand of the sea (Cf. Gen.
13:16), evidently using hyperbole, but offspring so great that no one could

insulted him, after having passed the danger, by the fact that the

neither feared nor faded. The philosopher replied that the young man had not
lost his calm precisely because he had nothing to fear for his perverted soul,
for he was not even worthy of fearing anything. The others, worried that they
had been with him on the ship, and awaiting a reply, presented them with a book
of the stoic Epictetus, in which it was said that it had not pleased the Stoics
to assert that no such disturbance affects the soul of the wise man, as if
nothing similar were found in their feelings. For they say that there is a
disturbance when reason yields to such sensations. When it does not yield,
there is no need to be called a disturbance. But we must take into account how

are old, although the name of old people is also given to people who are simply
advanced in age. Now, if it is true, as some doctors assert, that an elderly
husband cannot have the children of an elderly woman, even if she is still
experiencing what usually happens to women, We can understand Abraham's
astonishment at the promise of a son Cf. Gen. 17:17), and the reflection of the
Apostle (Cf. Rom 4:19), who sees it as a miracle, since he says that the body
of Abraham was already dead. It must not be imagined, however, that the body of
Abraham was dead, to such an extent that he could not have had the children of
a young woman; But it was so in the sense that it could not have been of a
woman advanced in age.<span>  </span>If he had
children of Céthura, it is because he took still young.<span>  </span>Doctors say that a man whose generative vigor
has fallen cannot have children with an elderly woman, even if the woman still
has menstruation; but you can have them with a young woman. And, on the other
hand, an elderly woman, although she still has menstruation, cannot have
children with an elderly man, may have in a union with a young man. Therefore,
that act of Abraham was a miracle, because, according to what we have said, the
body of that man was already dead, and the woman was of an age so advanced that
she no longer had menstruation. Now, if anyone would insist on interpreting
literally what the Apostle says that "Abraham's body was already
dead", and, in saying, dead he understood it in the sense that he no
longer had a soul, but was a corpse, he would be sadly wrong. Therefore, the

question often arises as to whether what God said about Sodom, namely, that he
would not punish that place if there were only ten righteous ones, is to be
understood only of that city, or, more generally, of any place, so that God
would forgive any place where only ten righteous ones would be found. I think
that in this matter we are not forced to accept that the text has to be
interpreted as a general law. But, as far as Sodom is concerned, God was able
to keep this manner of expression, because he knew that it contained not even
ten righteous. And his response was to make Abraham see that it was impossible
to find that number, so great was their iniquity. For God had no need to
forgive those wicked men so as not to punish the righteous with them, for he
could give the wicked worthy punishments, excluding the righteous. But as I
have said, to bring out the wickedness of that multitude, he said: If I find
ten righteous men there, I will spare the whole city. As if to say, "I
cannot punish the righteous with the wicked, but without forgiving the wicked;
for, when the righteous are liberated and separated from there, I can give to
the wicked their due; And yet, if those righteous ones are found there, I
forgive them ", knowing that even that number was not there. A similar
thing is found in Jeremiah (5:1), when he says, "Go through the streets of
Jerusalem, and look and search in their places, and see: if you find one who
practices righteousness and seeks faithfulness, I will forgive their sins, I
will forgive others. In this way he exaggerates and proves that not one could
even be found there.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

asked how he put such a big boy on her shoulder. For Ishmael had been
circumcised at the age of thirteen, before Isaac was born, when Abraham was
ninety-nine years old (Cf. Gen. 17:17-24). Isaac was born when his father was
one hundred years old. Ishmael was playing with Isaac when Sarah saw him with
concern (Cf. Gen. 21:9), Isaac was already a big boy, since he had already been
weaned. For all this, it is evident that Ishmael was more than sixteen years
old when he was expelled with his mother from his father's house. Now, even if
we consider that it was said in recapitulation that he played with Isaac when
he was still very young, before being weaned, nevertheless, it is too absurd to
believe that a child, even in this case of more than thirteen years, had been
placed on the shoulder of his mother, with a wineskin and some loaves. The
question is solved very easily if we do not understand "put", but
"gave". For Abraham, as it is written, gave to his mother loaves and
a wineskin, which she put on her shoulder. When it was added and said: also the

fir tree. And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were
a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I cannot see the death of my child: and she
sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept. And God heard the voice
of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Hagar out
of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Hagar? fear not, for God has heard the
voice of the child from the place where he is. Rise up, and take the child, and
hold him in your hand, for I will make him a great nation</i>. The question is
often asked how, when the child was more than fifteen years old, his mother
threw him under a tree and left at a distance as a bow shot so as not to see
him die. The text appears as if she had thrown down the child she was carrying,
especially considering what follows: ‘the child began to mourn’. But it must be
understood here that the child was thrown, not by the one who carried him, but,
as is often the case, by his state of mind, thinking that he was going to die.
For concerning these words of the Scripture: I am cast out from the sight of
your eyes (Ps. 30:23), neither was any man has said this. On the other hand, in
ordinary language there is the habit of saying something similar when one says
that he is thrown by another with whom he was with, so that he does not see or
remain with him. It must be understood, then, that the Scripture omitted to say
that the mother separated herself from her son so that the child did not know
where the mother had gone, and that she hid among the woods in the forest so as
not to see her child die of thirst. What, then, is it strange that, even at his
age, he would burst into tears when he had not seen his mother for so long and
thought that he had been lost in the place where he remained alone? In relation
to what the Scripture says: Take the child, he was not told to take it from the
ground, as if he were lying there, but to join him and then give him the hand
to accompany him, as he was, thing That usually do those who walk together of
any age that they are.</span></span><span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> <a name="_Hlk494438386"><font color="#000000">[Question 54]</font></a></span></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Well of the Oath was made, although the well would have been made later, but long
before the time of the writer (Moses). However, the well was named after the
book was written, retaining the ancient name Abraham had given it. But if it is
the same well that Hagar saw when opening her eyes, there is no other solution
than to solve the question by way of recapitulation. And it should come as no
surprise that Hagar did not know the well Abraham had dug, if the well was dug
before she was expelled. It could well be that, because of his herds, Abraham
dug the well away from the house where he lived with his family, and she did
not know of the well.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

OF ABRAHAM. —<span>  </span><i>And God tempted Abraham</i>. It is often asked how this can be true
when James says in his letter that God does not tempt anyone (Jas. 1:13). The
answer is that the language of Scripture often uses the word "tempt"
with the meaning of "prove." Instead, the temptation spoken of by
James is understood only as referring to that by which one falls into the nets
of sin. That is why the Apostle says: lest the tempter should tempt you (1
Thess. 3:5). For it is written elsewhere: The Lord your God tempts you to know
if you love him (Deut. 13:3). Naturally, this expression says: to know, as if
it were said: "to make you know", because the power of love itself is
hidden from man, if God does not make it known through a test of his.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 57]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

said from Heaven to Abraham: "Do not put your hand on the child, and do
nothing to him." For I know that you fear God. This issue resolves, like
the previous one, by an analogy of expressions; For these words: "I know
now that you fear God" mean: now I make you known. This way of speaking is
clearly understood in the following text: "And Abraham called this place:
the Lord saw;" And it is said today: The Lord appeared on the mountain. He
saw, put for: He appeared (Gen. 22:14), has the same meaning as: he did see;

IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ANGEL, OR OUT OF RESPECT FOR GOD, THAT ABRAHAM WAS
PREPARED NOT TO SPARE HIS SON? — <i>and for
My sake you have not spared your beloved son</i>. Is it that Abraham did not
spare his son by an angel or God? The solution is that under the name of an
angel it is to be understood that it was our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
undoubtedly God, and the prophet expressly calls him Angel of Great Counsel
(Is. 9:6), or that God was in the angel and the angel spoke in name of God, as
he usually does through the prophets.<span> 
</span>This latter sense appears to be drawn more clearly in the following
words of the text: "And the Angel of the Lord called again Abraham from
the top of heaven, saying: I sworn by myself, says the Lord (Gen.
22:15-16)." It is difficult indeed to find that here Christ engages God
the Father as his Lord, in this time frame who preceded the Incarnation. With
regard to the form of slave that he has taken, this expression seems not to be
lacking in modesty. Indeed to prophesy this event it is said in a psalm: “The
Lord said to me: you are my son (Ps. 2:7).” But it is difficult to discover in
the Gospel itself, that Christ calls God the Father his Lord, because this
would be true, though he calls him God, in this passage where they say: "</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">I ascend to my Father and

of Scripture: "The Lord said to my lord," it is in the name of the
one who speaks that they are uttered: "The Lord said to my lord (Ps.
109:1)," that is, the Father told the Son. Thus these other words:
"The Lord made rain… from the Lord (Gen. 19:24; Lk. 17:29)," are also
said in the name of the sacred writer and here is the meaning: the Lord of this
writer sent the rain on the part of his Lord; Our Lord on behalf of our Lord,
the Son of the Father.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

is the Lord to whom one must worship (Cf. Rev. 19:10). Indeed, the angel had

when he begged God to show him that the wife of his master Isaac would be the

thing to ask for a miracle which is extraordinary; it is another thing to

inquiry.<span>  </span>From here it is understood that
it is said that they tempt the Lord who do not do it correctly. The Lord
himself, being tempted by the devil, proclaimed proof from Scripture: You shall
not tempt the Lord your God (Mt. 4:7). Indeed, the Lord was asked as if he were
a mere mortal, that he himself show with some proof with a miracle how great he
was, that is, the great power he had before God; which is a sin to do. But this
evil temptation must not be confused with the conduct of Gideon (Jud. 6:17),
who was in a hurry to engage in battle with the enemy: he consulted God on this
occasion rather than tempt him. Ahaz also feared in Isaiah to solicit a miracle
for fear of appearing to tempt God at the moment when the Lord gives him the
advice of the prophet to ask for one (Is. 4:11-12). He probably believed that
the prophet was trying to find out if he remembered the precept that forbids
God to tempt.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question

word, think that it is a bodily exercise. But the Greek says: </span><span style="color:black;line-height:115%;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

considered somewhat bad. But Scripture tends to use that word most of the time
in good sense. Some of our translators translate that word into 'exercise';
others translate it by 'chat', a kind of verbiage. And this word verbiage, as
far as the Latin language is concerned, is never or almost never used in a good
sense. But, as I have just said, in Scripture the Greek word is used many times
in the good sense, and I believe that this expression signifies the state of a
soul deeply absorbed in meditation, and finding its delights there. Those who
know Greek better may find a preferable meaning.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 69]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

POLYGAMY. <i>—<span>  </span>And Abraham again took a wife, whose name was
Keturah</i>.<span>  </span>The question that arises
here is whether this would be a sin, thinking especially of the ancients, who
were dedicated to the propagation of the offspring. Here you can think of
anything but the lack of self-restraint of a man so outstanding as Abraham,
taking into account also his advanced age. I said earlier why he had children
of Keturah, when Sarah only had them by miracle. Although there are some who
think that Abraham's gift, consisting of a kind of bodily rejuvenation to
father children, remained in him for a long time, so that he could become the
father of other children. But it is much easier for an elderly man to have
children of a young girl than to have a man of advanced age from a woman of
similar age, if God had not done in him a miracle, taking into account, above
all, not only the age of Sarah, but also her sterility. In fact, a man of an
advanced age can even be called an elderly man, and, as the Scripture says, to
one full of days. This is what is meant by πρεσβυτην (elder), which is what was
said of Abraham when he died.<span>   </span>Every old
man is therefore an (elder) πρεσβυτης, but every πρεσβυτης is not an old man:</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">for it is ordinarily
referred to as the age next to oldness. Also, in the Latin language, the word
old age, <i>senectute</i>, is “senior” which
means old age and applies to πρεσβυτης.<span> 
</span>In Greek, mainly in the style of writing, it is said by contrast
πρεσβυτεροι and νεωτεροι even when we still speak of young men, as we say among
us the eldest, and the youngest. However, the fact that Abraham, after Sara's
death, had children by Keturah, should not be taken in the sense that this is
due to human custom and desire only to have a larger offspring. Because then men
could also interpret what happened with Hagar, if the apostle had not warned us
that those things prophetically came to pass (Gal. 4:22-24), so that in the
people of those two women and their children the allegorical sense would
represent the two Testaments for the revelation of future things. That is why,
in this fact of Abraham, we must also look for something similar. Although this
sense does not appear easily, I, in the meantime, say what I think: the gifts
that the children of the concubines received (Cf. Gen. 25:5-6) seem to me to
mean certain gifts of God already in the mysteries, already in certain signs
given also to the carnal people of the Jews and the heretics, as children of
the concubines, while the gift of the inheritance, which is charity and eternal
life, belongs only to Isaac, that is, to the children of the promise.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 70]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Where did she go, if not at the place where Abraham had established an altar?
But the Scripture says absolutely nothing about the way the answers were given
there, if by means of a priest, it seems incredible that it had not been mentioned,
if there were any, and that no mention be made of it that there were priests
there, or perhaps once they had expressed their desires there by prayer, they
waited asleep to receive the answer in their dreams? Or was Melchizedek still
alive, whose excellency was so great, that some doubted whether he was a man or
an angel? Or was there, at that time, men of God like himself, by whom they

</span>In the answer that the Lord gives to Rebekah: <i>There are two nations in your womb and two peoples shall be separated
from your belly, and one people shall excel the other, and the greater shall
serve the lesser</i>. According to the spiritual sense, the carnal men of the
people of God are signified by the eldest son, and spiritual men by the younger
son, because, as the Apostle says: Yet that was not first which is spiritual,
but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:46).
These words are still understood in the sense that Esau is the eldest people of
God, that is, the Israelites according to the flesh, while Jacob signifies his
own spiritual descent.<span>  </span>History in turn
complements this answer made by God when it relates that the people of Israel,
that is to say Jacob, the younger, overcame the Idumeans, that is to say, the
nation which came from Esau, and made them inferior in the time of David (Cf. 2
Sam. 8:13-14; 1 Kgs. 11:15). The Idumeans remained long in this state, until
King Jehoram, under the reign of which they revolted and issued themselves to
the yoke of the Israelites, according to Isaac's own prophecy, when he blessed
the younger instead of the eldest (Cf. Gen 27:26, 39-40). Since all this he
told the eldest, when he also blessed him after having blessed his brother. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question 73]</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"> </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

What the Greek text qualifies as απλαστος, some Latins translated it as <i>simplicem</i> (simple). But απλαστος
accurately means "sincere." For this reason, some Latin translators
translated that word “<i>sine dolo</i>”<i> </i>(without deceit), giving the phrase the
following meaning: “Jacob was a man without deceit, who lived at home.” Hence
arises the great problem of knowing how the blessing received through a
deception was considered for a man without deception. The answer is that
Scripture anticipated this to mean something great. Therefore, we are totally
obliged to understand something spiritual in this passage, because it was a man
without deception who acted with deceit. I have sufficiently developed, in a

this event occurred. Was it after Esau had sold his birthright for a meal of
lentils, that this begins to be narrated? Or, as is often the case, did the
narrator return to this matter by recapitulation, when, abandoning the story
about his children, he returned to that passage that we have mentioned of the
plate of lentils? We ask ourselves, too, why does Abimelech himself appear
here, who had even desired Sarah, and his companion and the chief of his troops</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">is also mentioned (Cf.

Isaac was not yet born, but his birth was already promised. Suppose that it
happened a year before Isaac was born. Then after Isaac, at the age of sixty,
had children, but they were young when Esau sold his birthright. Suppose also
that they were about twenty years old. Then Isaac's age, when the event of his
sons took place, would be about eighty years. Suppose Abimelech was a young man
when he desired Sarah and became friends with Abraham.<span>  </span>He could, therefore, be almost a hundred
years old, if he went to that land pressed by famine after that event of his
children. Nothing, therefore, obliges us to think that the departure of Isaac
for Gerera is reported by way of recapitulation.<span>  </span>But as it is said that Isaac remained for a
long time in this country, that he dug wells, on the occasion of which there
were disputes, and that he became very rich (Cf. Gen 26:14). It would be
strange that these things are mentioned if the author does not resort to recapitulation.
These things would therefore have been passed over in silence, in order to
enable the narrative to speak first of the sons of Isaac to the place where the
lentil dish is mentioned.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

humble. So that whoever is faithful in the least may also be faithful in the
great, and whoever has been found faithful in the unrighteous riches deserves
also to receive true wealth, as the Lord says in the Gospel (Cf. Lk. 16:10-11).
It is also said of Abraham that his riches were a blessing from God. This

beautiful simplicity of ancient times, to kiss between parents and relatives,

Rachel accepts the kiss from a stranger, since Jacob revealed his kinship only
after kissing her. One of these two assumptions must therefore be used:</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Thus, it is necessary to
think that he, who had already heard who she was, rushed himself with all

who he was. It is something similar to what happens with the story of Paradise.
It tells how God, having already said before that He had planted it and had put
in it the man who He had formed (Cf. Gen. 2:8). There are many other examples

which used to last seven days. The following is said: <i>and fulfilled the sevens</i> of marriage that correspond to her with
whom you have married, and I will also give to the other for the service that
you will lend me for another seven years. Then he continues: <i>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her sevens</i>;
that is, the seven days of marriage with Leah, <i>And Laban gave his daughter Raquel his wife. And Laban gave his slave
Bala as a bondwoman to his daughter Rachel. And Jacob also joined Rachel, and
loved Rachel more than Leah, and served her uncle another seven years</i>. It
appears clearly that, after marrying Rachel, he served her another seven years.
It would have been too hard and too unfair that, in addition to deceiving
Jacob, Laban would delay the delivery by another seven years and only then
deliver to whom he should have given from the first place. That the wedding
used to be celebrated for seven days is also demonstrated by the book of
Judges, when he speaks of Samson, who celebrated a banquet for seven days (Cf.
Judg. 14:10). And Scripture adds that such was the custom of young men.<span>  </span>But Samson made this feast for his wedding.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 89]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE ENGINEERING OF JACOB TO VARY THE COLOR OF HERDS. — About what Jacob did,
when he took off the bark of the branches, tearing out the green to make them
look white, so that at the moment of conception, when the mothers would drink
in the water of the canals, and would look upon the branches in this variety of
colors, the flocks of the herds also became spotted. It is said that many facts
of the same nature are produced in the animals. There is even a similar story
of a woman, and</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> a </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">skillful
physician of the highest antiquity, which is described in the books of
Hippocrates<span style="color:red">*</span>. The woman, therefore, having
brought into the world a child of rare beauty, who had no resemblance either to
its father or mother or to its family; the woman was under the suspicion of
adultery, condemned to execution. But the physician whom we mentioned above
decided to inquire by seeking counsel to see if there was not some similar
picture of the child in the bedroom. A similar picture was found, and this
woman was relieved of suspicion. Let us return to what Jacob did: It is not
clear how useful it was, for the multiplication of spotted animals, the meeting
of three branches of different trees; It was not important for this result that
the spotted branches were made from one or more tree species, since the variety
of colors was the only necessary condition. We must therefore see a prophecy
and a figurative sense in this act that, without a doubt, Jacob did as a
prophet: And that is why he should not be accused of deceit. One must believe
indeed, that he did not behave in this way only according to a spiritual
revelation. Now, in order not to violate justice, as other translators say it
more clearly, he did not lay the branches when the sheep conceived a second
time. This is what the Septuagint says in few words and with some obscurity: </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><span><font face="Calibri"> </font></span></span><i><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">But

(Gen. 30:42). This assertion must be understood in the sense that as soon as
they had given birth for the first time, so that they do not think that they
used to put them when they were going to give birth a second time, so that he
did not take all the offspring, which would be an injustice.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 93]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE CONDUCT OF LABAN TO JACOB IN RELATION TO THE HERDS. — What does it mean
what Jacob says to his father-in-law, <i>and
you did falsely rate my wages for ten lambs</i>? For the Scripture does not say
when or where this was done. But obviously what Jacob mentions did happen. He
even told his wives, when he made them come to the country, complaining about
their father, he says among other things: "And he changed my wages to ten
lambs (Gen. 31:7)." It happened, therefore, that in each of the times the
lambs were born.<span>  </span>When Laban saw that the
offspring that was agreed upon that they belonged to Jacob, Laban fraudulently
changed the agreement and said that Jacob would have as payment other colored
lambs that would be born in the future. Jacob no longer the varying shades, but
there were no spotted offspring, but only one-color offspring, which Jacob took
under the new agreement. When Laban became aware of this, he again fraudulently
changed the agreement so that the spotted lambs belonged to Jacob. And the
spotted lambs were born because Jacob had put out those branches. Then what
Jacob says to his wives: "He changed my pay into ten lambs”, and then to
Laban: “You took away from my wages ten lambs.” Jacob therefore does not wish
to make it understood that this disloyalty benefited his father-in-law, for he
says that God helped him against Laban to prevent this result. But he wagered
ten lambs or ten young lambs to indicate the ten times that the sheep he kept
had offspring for a six-year term. They gave birth twice a year. However, the
first year he dealt with Laban, and he agreed to keep the flocks for the agreed
reward, the sheep only gave lambs once at the end of the year, the first litter
having already come, when the commitment was contracted. The same thing
happened in the sixth and last year. When the sheep had given a first litter,
it was necessary for Jacob to leave, before they had given the second. Thus, as
the first year and the last year had only two births, that is, each year one,
and, on the other hand, the four years in between had two in each one, they
make a total of ten births.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt"><span> </span>It is not surprising that he designates these

hearing the harvest, and the harvests of the years. As to the fertility of the

his people, dividing them into two camps. When we arrive here we can ask how he
could have faith in the promises of God if he said: <i>If Esau should come to one camp, and destroy it, the other camp shall
be in safety</i> (Gen. 32:8). But it could also happen that Esau destroyed his
camps, and yet, after that affliction, God would help him and deliver him and
fulfill what he had promised. This example should serve as a warning to us, so
that, even if we believe in God, let us, however, do what men must do to
protect their lives, lest by omitting these measures it seems that we tempt
God. Finally, after this we must meditate on the words that Jacob himself said:
<i>God of my father Abraham, and God of my
father Isaac, O Lord, you are he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of
your birth, and I will do you good. Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the
justice and all the truth which you have wrought with your servant; for with
this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps. Deliver
me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him,
unless he gladly should come and kill me, and the mother upon the children. But
you said, I will do you good, and will make your seed as the sand of the sea,
which shall not be numbered for multitude</i> (Gen. 32:9-12).<span>  </span>In these words appear both and the weakness
of man and pious faith.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">

then, how could Jacob want to be blessed by someone he defeated in the fight?
Jacob overcame Christ, or rather seemed to conquer him through those Israelites

in Christ, among whom was the one who said, “For I am also an Israelite, of the

THESE WORDS: I SAW YOUR FACE AS WHEN ONE SEES THE FACE OF A GOD. — What does
Jacob mean to his brother: <i>therefore have
I seen your face, as if anyone should see the face of God</i>? Is it possible
that the words of a frightened and disturbed person have reached such a degree
of adoration? Can they perhaps be taken as blameless to indicate some special
meaning? Perhaps, indeed, since even the gods of the gentiles, who are demons
(Cf. Ps. 95:5), are called gods, do not misjudge the man of God by these words,
for he did not say: "as if I saw the face of God”, but <i>as if anyone should see</i>. But we do not
know who that "anyone" is to whom it could mean. And perhaps the
words have been chosen so that Esau himself would welcome the honor so great
his brother did to him. And those who are able to interpret them even in a
different way, do not dare to accuse the one who said them of any sin. For
although these words, spoken with good intention, are fraternal, and since even
fear itself had disappeared after the brother had received them well, that
expression could be used, just as, for example, Moses was also called the god
of Pharaoh (Cf. Ex 7:1), according to what the Apostle says, “Although there
are those who are called gods or in heaven or on earth, as there are many gods
and many lords (1 Cor. 8:5).” And it may be said above all in view of the fact
that in Greek the word does not carry an article, because it is used most
obviously to indicate the only true God. Actually it did not say, προσωπον του
Θεου, but προσωπον Θεου. Now, those who often hear and understand the Greek

How can the Scripture say that she was a virgin, if he had already slept with

indicate age, according to the Hebrew expression. Or perhaps it is rather a
recapitulation by means of which the author then says what happened before? In

COULD JACOB'S CHILDREN HAVE DONE SO MUCH HARM TO THE SICHIMITES? — Speaking to
Jacob shortly before with his brother Esau says that his children are still
children. That word in Greek expresses by the word παιδια. We may ask how they
were able to make such a massacre and devastation in the city, by putting to
death, even in the midst of their sufferings, those who had circumcised
themselves for their sister Dina. The answer is that we must know that Jacob
lived there for a long time until his daughter became a girl and her children
were young. For the Scripture says, <i>And
Jacob came to Salem, a city of the Shechemites, which is in the land of Canaan,
when he departed out of Mesopotamian Syria, and encamped in front of the city.
And he bought the portion of the field, where he pitched his tent, of Emmor the
father of Sychem, for a hundred lambs. And he built there an alter, and called
on the God of Israel. And Dina, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob,
went forth to observe the daughters of the inhabitants</i>, etc. By these words
it is seen that Jacob stayed there not in a fleeting way, as a traveler usually
does, but bought a field, established a tent, erected an altar, and so lived in
that place for a long time. His daughter, when she reached the age of being
able to have friends, wanted to meet the daughters of the local citizens. And
on account of it took place that dreadful slaughter and plunder, I think, no
longer needs an explanation. There was indeed a not small crowd with Jacob, who
had grown rich. Their children are mentioned in this misdeed, because they were

BENJAMIN BORN IN MESOPOTAMIA? — When the twelve sons who were born to Israel
are mentioned, it is said: <i>These are the
sons of Israel, who were born to him in Mesopotamia</i>. Now Benjamin was born
long afterwards, when Bethel had already passed and they were approaching
Bethlehem. Some interpreters strive unnecessarily to decide this question,
saying that one should not read: <i>nati
sunt</i>, as most Latin copies do, but <i>facti
sunt</i>, according to the Greek text εγενοντο, pretending to understand also
Benjamin</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-size:10pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">would
not have been born in Mesopotamia, but there he had come, since he was already
begotten in the womb of his mother, for it is thought that Rachel had come out
of there pregnant. In this way, although it was read, they were born to him, it
could be said that he was already born in the womb, since he had already been
conceived. As an example, what was said to Joseph about the Virgin Mary is
indicated, “For what has been born in her is of the Holy Spirit (Mt. 1:20).”<span>  </span>But there is another reason that prevents
this solution of the problem. For if Benjamin had been conceived there, the
sons of Jacob, who had come out of that place and grown up, could scarcely be
twelve years old. For Jacob spent twenty years there. Of these twenty, the
first seven years without being married, hoping to marry serving Laban.
Assuming that the year he was married was born a child, the oldest could be
about twelve, when they left. Therefore, if Benjamin had already been
conceived, all that journey had to take place within ten months, and all that
was written about Jacob in the journey. It follows that their children, such
small children, would have carried out such a large slaughter on the occasion
of their sister Dina, would have killed a large number of men and thus have
taken possession of the city. Two of them, Simeon and Levi, who with sword in
hand, were the first to reach these men, and killed them, were age eleven and
the other ten years. Their mother would have had without interruption, a child
every year. But it is unbelievable that children of this age could have done
all this, when Dina herself was barely six years old. Therefore, we must find
another solution to this problem so that we correctly understand what was said
about the twelve children mentioned. These are the sons of Jacob, who came to
him in Mesopotamia of Syria. Because among all those children, who were so
many, there was one who was not born there, but who had reason to be born in
that place, since his mother had married there with his father. But this
solution of the problem must be confirmed by some example of another similar
expression. There is no easier solution to this question than recourse to a
synecdoche (A figure of speech that uses the name of a part of something to represent
the whole). Thus, when in one part is greater or more important, it is usually
also designated by its name that which does not belong to the name itself. For
example, the case of Judas, who no longer belonged to the twelve apostles,
because he had already died when the Lord rose from the dead (Cf. 1 Cor. 15:5),
and yet the Apostle keeps in his letter the number of twelve when he says that
the Lord Appeared to the twelve. The Greek codices have this word with an
article, so that no twelve persons can be understood, but those known by that
number. I think that this same type of expression belongs to what the Lord
said, “Have I not chosen you, the twelve? And one of you is a devil.” And he
says so that it does not appear that he too belongs to the elect. It is not
easy to speak of the elect with reference to evil, except when the bad ones are
chosen by other bad ones. But if we thought that Judas was also chosen so that
through his betrayal the Lord's passion would be realized, that is, if we
thought his wickedness was chosen for something, since God uses good even of
bad things, let us pay attention to these other words, I do not mean all of
you; I know who I chose (Jn. 6:70). Here he declares that only the good belong
to the elect. And so, that which the Lord said, “I chose you twelve,” he said
it through a synecdoche, so that under the name of the greater part and better
understood also what does not belong to the name itself. This way of expressing
itself is in this same book when Emmor goes to speak with Jacob in favor of his
son Shechem to obtain that he married Dina, the daughter of Jacob. And the sons
of Jacob, which were absent, came, and Emmor said unto them all, My son Shechem
is fond of your daughter; Give her then for a wife (Gen. 34:8).” As the person
of the father was the most important, in saying, by synecdoche, your daughter,
also understands under that name the brothers, of whom Dina was not a daughter.
To this same type also belongs the expression: Go to the sheep and bring me
from there two kids. For they grazed the sheep and the goats at the same time.
And since the sheep are more important, under that name it also included goats.
Now as the eleven number of the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in
Mesopotamia, was the most important, when he mentioned the Scripture to them,
he also understood Benjamin, who was not born there. And he said, <i>These are the sons of Jacob, who came to him

can say that Esau, at the death of his father Isaac, withdrew from the land of
Canaan and went to live on Mount Seir, when another passage reads that when his
brother Jacob came Mesopotamia, he already lived there. Therefore, we must find
the reason why this is said, in order not to believe that Scripture is wrong or
deceives us. Esau, after his brother went to Mesopotamia, did not want to live
with his parents, either because of the anger that tormented him to be deprived
and deceived of the blessing, either for the sake of his wives, who he saw that
they were hateful to their relatives, or for any other reason, and so he went
to live on Mount Seir. Later, after the return of his brother Jacob and once
peace was established between them (Cf. Gen. 33:4), he returned even with his
parents, and went back to Seir, giving rise there to the town of the Idumeans,
after burying together his father, who had died. And the reason for leaving was
that the land which, as the Scripture says, had enriched them so much, was no
longer sufficient for both (Cf. Gen. 36:7).</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 119]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

THE KINGS OF EDOM. — <i>These are the kings
who reigned in Edom before a king reigned in Israel.</i> This passage must not be
understood, as if it contained the number of all the kings, from Edom, until
the time when the kingdom began in Israel even in the days of Saul. There were
many kings in Edom before the coming of Saul in the days of the Judges, which
preceded the kingdom; but among these kings Moses could only name those who
lived before his death. And not surprised to find, from Abraham to the last
king named by Moses, through Esau, the father of the people of Edom; by Raguel
the son of Esau; by Zara, son of Raguel; by Jacob the son of Zara, and by Balak
his successor, who is given as the first king of Edom, more generations than
are counted by Jacob from Abraham to Moses. There indeed are nearly twelve
generations, and here scarcely seven as far as Moses. It may have happened that
where there are the most, there have been more kings to succeed each other,
because death took them away more quickly. Thus, following a different order,
St. Matthew has two generations, from Abraham to Joseph (Mt. 1:1-17); St. Luke,
according to another order, and counting the generations, not by Solomon, but
by Nathan, enumerates fifty-five from Abraham to Joseph (Lk. 3:23-28). In the
line where we count the most generations, death has been more prompt than in
that where it counts the least. And in fear lest we should be astonished that
Balak the son of Beor should be numbered with the kings of Edom, and because of
the likeness of the name, it is not imagined that it was this Balac who
resisted Moses, the leader of the people of Israel, it must be known that this
was Moabite and not Idumean, and that he was from Sephor and not from Beor;
there was in the days of Moses a son of Beor, whose name was Balaam, and not
Balak, and it was this same Balak who called Balaam to curse the people of
Israel (Num. 22:2-6). </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question

JOSEPH SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN ISRAEL DIED? — From whatever side we turn, it
is difficult to find out how, at Isaac's death, Joseph, his grandson, could be
seventeen years, as seems to result from the narrative in Scripture. I do not
wish to be proved, for I cannot know what would not escape others. If Joseph,
after the death of Isaac his grandfather, was seventeen years old, when his
brothers sold him for Egypt, there is no doubt that at the same time his father
Jacob was one hundred and twenty. Indeed, according to Scripture (Gen. 25:26),
Isaac was sixty years old when he had Esau and Jacob; he lived a hundred and
twenty years afterwards, for he died a hundred and eighty years old; so he left
his sons a hundred and twenty years old and Joseph seventeen years old. As
Joseph was thirty years old, when he appeared at the court of Pharaoh, and
there was then seven years of abundance, and two famines, until the coming of
his father and of his brethren, Joseph reached his thirty-ninth year, when
Jacob came to Egypt (Gen. 47:9). Now, at that time, Jacob had come, as he
himself said to Pharaoh, at his one hundred and thirtieth year; and he was a
hundred and twenty years old, when Joseph was seventeen: it is absolutely
impossible that this should be true. For if Jacob were a hundred and twenty
years old, when Joseph had seventeen; at the time when he was thirty-nine, it
was not a hundred-thirty years, but a hundred-forty-two that Jacob had to reckon.
And if Joseph had not yet attained his seventeenth year at the death of Isaac,
but only some time afterwards, as at this age he was sold by his brothers in
Egypt, to the testimony of Scripture, it follows that his father must have been
more than a hundred and forty-two years old, when he went to find his son in
Egypt. Indeed, after having said that Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years;
after having related his death and burial, the Scripture records how Esau left
his brother and the land of Canaan to retreat to mount Seir; then it gives the
terminology of kings, and interweaves the mention of kings and princes of the
race in which Esau was established or propagated (Cf. Gen. 36:6-43). After
this, Joseph's story begins in the following terms: “But Jacob dwelt in the
land of Canaan.” Now this is what concerns the children of Jacob. Joseph,
seventeen years of age, was feeding the herds with his brethren. It is then
said how, on account of his dreams, he became the object of the hatred of these
same brothers, and was sold by them (Gen. 37:1-2). So it was at the age of
seventeen, or at a somewhat more advanced age, that he came to Egypt; but
whatever the hypothesis is adopted, the problem remains. For if he was
seventeen years after the death of his grandfather, when his father was one
hundred and twenty, evidently at thirty-nine, when Jacob went to Egypt, Jacob
had to be one hundred and forty-two; but Jacob was only one hundred and thirty
years old. That is why, if Joseph was sold to Egypt at the age of seventeen, he
was sold twelve years before his grandfather died. It is necessarily twelve
years before the death of Isaac, and when Jacob his father was a hundred and
eight years old, then Joseph was seventeen years old. In addition to the
twenty-two years he spent in Egypt before the arrival of his father, we shall
find thirty-nine years for the age of Joseph, and a hundred and thirty for the
age of Jacob, and the question will be settled. But as the Scripture describes
these events after Isaac's death, Joseph is thought to be seventeen years after
his grandfather's death. Therefore, we must think that the Scripture did not
say anything about the life of Isaac, as of a very decrepit elder, when he
began to speak of Jacob and his children. Joseph, however, began to turn
seventeen when Isaac was still alive. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question 122]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

QUESTION. — <i>And it came to pass at that
time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and went unto an Adollamite,
called Ira. And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua, and
took her for a wife, and came to her, and conceived, and bare a son</i>, etc.
We want to know when these things could happen. For if it happened after Joseph
had come down to Egypt, how in the space of twenty-two years; for after so long
it was clear that they were able to go to Egypt with their father to see their
brother; it could happen that all the sons of Judah of that time could marry?
For when his firstborn son died, he married his daughter-in-law Tamar to
another of his sons (Cf. Gen. 38:6-11). This second died, waited for the son
third to grow. When he got older, he did not give her as his wife, fearing that
he too would die. So it happened that she gave herself to her own father-in-law
(Cf. Gen. 38:12-18). With all reason, therefore, the problem arises of knowing
how so many things could happen in so few years. The explanation might be that,
as is often the case, Scripture meant by way of recapitulation that all this
began to happen some years before the sale of Joseph, because the text is
written as follows: “It happened at that time.” Nevertheless, if Joseph was
seventeen when he was sold, the question arises as to how many years Judah,
Jacob's fourth son, could have, since his firstborn, Reuben, could have at most
five or six more than his brother Joseph. But it is clear that Scripture says
that Joseph was thirty years old when he became known to Pharaoh (Cf. Gen.
41:46). Now, if one thinks that he was sold at seventeen years of age, he would
have spent thirteen years in Egypt unknown to Pharaoh. To these thirteen years
we would have to add the seven of abundance, and thus we arrived at the twenty
years. To these should be added the two years of famine, because Jacob went to
Egypt with his children the second year of the famine. And so we are at twenty-two
years old, during which Joseph was far from his father and his brothers. Well,
it is difficult to know how in this interim of time all the things that were
told about the woman, the children and the daughter-in-law of Judah could
happen. Unless we think, well, it may have happened that Judah, when he was a
teenager, fell in love with the woman he married before Joseph was sold into
Egypt. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question 128]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

insinuated in this book. The first time it was said: “And the spirit of God was
carried on the water (Gen. 1:2).” The second time, where God said, "My spirit
will not abide in these men, for they are flesh (Gen. 6:3)." The third
time here, when Pharaoh says that Joseph has the spirit of God. But the Holy
Spirit is not yet said. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question

FATHER-IN-LAW. — <i>And he gave him Asenath
the daughter of Potiphar, the priest of the city of the sun</i>. We often
wondered who this Potiphar was, that is, whether he was the servant of Joseph
or another. Most likely it was another. In fact, there are many reasons to
think that it is not the first one. First, because the Scripture does not
mention anything that could report no small glory to that young man, we seem to
have been able to omit such a thing, namely, to marry the daughter of that man
in whose house he served. Secondly, how could a eunuch have a daughter? To this
we answer: And how could he have a wife? Thus, it is believed that he became a
eunuch or because of some injury or of his own volition. In addition it is
necessary to consider the fact that there is not even a mention his position,
as is usually done, and that was the αρχιμαγειρος, title that the Latin
translators translated as head chefs and others translate as head of the
militia. But this is also answered by saying that he had those two positions,
the priesthood of the Sun and the head of the militia. In another place,
however, the position which he held and which was suitable for such acts was
appropriately remembered, and here, after Joseph had manifested a not
insignificant divine quality, that office must have been mentioned by his
father-in-law; divine quality not small, in the opinion of the Egyptians, since
it boasted the priesthood of the Sun. Now in all this, since he was also head
of the prison guard, it seems too incredible that a priest was the head of this
job. Moreover, Scripture does not simply say that he was a priest of the Sun,
but of the city of the Sun, called Heliopolis. It is said that this city is
more than twenty miles from the city of Memphis, where the Pharaohs, that is, the
kings, resided in a special way. How, then, could he courageously serve the
king in the leadership of the militia, abandoning the office of priest? It
should be added, furthermore, that they are said to have always rendered their
services only in the temples of the gods and did not perform any other office.
But just in case things happened in another way, that each one think what he
wants, since there is no problem that has no solution, whether there has been a
single Potiphar or two. Neither of these two hypotheses that one admits is
dangerous to faith or contrary to the truth of the Scriptures of God.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> <a name="_Hlk492282365"><font color="#000000">[Question 136]</font></a></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"BY THE SALVATION OF PHARAOH." — How could Joseph, a man so prudent
and so praised, not only by the testimony of the men among whom he lived, but
by the affirmation of his own Scripture, so swear by the salvation of Pharaoh
that his brothers would not depart from Egypt if their younger brother did not
come with them? Is it true that even for a good and faithful man the salvation
of Pharaoh was despicable, to whom was he faithful as before, in everything, as
his master? And how much more should he keep to him who had placed him in such
an important post, if he kept it to him who owned him as a servant who had bought!
And if he did not care for Pharaoh's salvation, should he not have avoided
perjury for the salvation of any man? Is it not perjury? He kept one of his
brothers until Benjamin came and fulfilled what he had said: You will not leave
here, unless your brother comes (Gen. 42:15). For these words of his could not
refer to all his brothers, for how could Benjamin come if some had not come to
bring him? But the words that come next pose an even greater problem, when he
swears again, saying, Send one of you and bring your brother. In the meantime,
the rest of you will remain here prisoners until your words are checked, to see
if you speak the truth or not. If not, for the salvation of Pharaoh! that you
are spies (Gen. 42:16), that is, if you do not tell the truth, you are spies.
He ratified these words with an oath, for if they had not told the truth, they
would be spies, that is, they would be liable to the punishment of the spies,
those men who, in spite of everything, knew that they were telling the truth. In
reality, one is not a perjurer if he says to someone, who knows that he is an
absolutely chaste person; "If you have committed this adultery of which
you are accused, God condemns you," adding an oath to these words. This
individual swears a totally true thing, because there is given the condition
that he used, saying: if you have done it, when you know perfectly well that he
has not done it. But someone can say: it is true, because if he committed
adultery, God condemns him. But how can this be true: if you do not tell the
truth, you are spies, when, even if they lie, they would not be spies? Well,
this is what it said in the Scripture: you are spies, as if you had said: you
are worthy of the punishment of the spies, that is, you will be considered spies
because of your lie. That the word you have been able to be used instead of
"you will be held by" or "you will be considered as" is
demonstrated by many other similar expressions, such as that of Elijah: He who
hears in the fire, that will be God (I Kgs. 18:24). It does not mean that then
it will be God, but then it will be had by such. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question 139]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

in many passages who read carefully. An example: You have visited the earth and
drunk it; you have filled it with riches (Ps. 65:10). As these words are said
to exalt the blessing and the gift of God is remembered in them, it is clear
that with this drunkenness satiety is indicated. For the earth does not get
drunk as drunkards get drunk, since this would not be useful to it, because a
greater humidity than the earth needs does not to satisfy it, but spoils it. Such
is the life of drunkards, who are not filled by satiety, but are plunged into

should one think that it is not a lie? Lies, in fact, are from liars that are
serious, not joking. On the other hand, things that are said jokingly and do
not exist are not considered lies. But the greatest problem is the meaning of
Joseph's actions with his brothers, making fun of them so often and keeping
them in suspense until they discovered who he was. For although the action,
when it is read, is all the softer and the more unexpected for those to whom it
was addressed, however, given the seriousness of Joseph's prudence, if there
were no significant meaning in this kind of game, then neither he would have

Egyptians so that a remnant of Israel would be saved. That is why the Apostle
says: “For I am an Israelite (Rom. 11:1),” and “until all the Gentiles come in,
and thus all Israel may be saved (Rom. 11:25-26),” then it is the rest of
Israel, according to the flesh, and all the nations, who are Israel by faith in
Christ, according to the Spirit. Or even of the people of Israel, if they

said, not only have the Hebrew codices in this passage, but the Septuagint
itself in the Exodus (1:5), and the Septuagint's version do not seem to me
wrong in this, for this, by some mystical meaning and, using a certain
prophetic freedom, wanted to complete this number, if still living Jacob,
spread from the two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, those individuals whom the
Septuagint version believed should be added to the number of the people of the
house of Jacob. Now if, on the one hand, it is known that Jacob lived seventeen
years in Egypt (Cf. Gen. 47:28), on the other hand, it is not known how the
sons of Joseph could have grandchildren, while Jacob still lived. Jacob, in
fact, entered Egypt the second year of the famine. Joseph's children, on the
other hand, were born in the years of abundance (Cf. Gen. 46:21), although they
do not know the years of the abundance in which they were born. From the first year
of the abundance to the second year of the famine, when Jacob entered Egypt,
there are nine years. If we add to these the seventeen years that Jacob lived
there, he was twenty-six years old. How could young people under the age of
twenty-six have grandchildren? This question cannot be resolved by any Hebrew
text. For how could Jacob have so many grandchildren before entering Egypt,
even of his son Benjamin, who at that time came to his brother Joseph? For the
Scripture not only speaks of Jacob having children, but also grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, all of whom must be added to those sixty-six persons with
whom Jacob entered into Egypt, as it says even the Hebrew text itself. It is
also necessary to consider the fact that while Joseph and his children are only
eight, Benjamin and his children are eleven in all, not nineteen among all, as
indeed eight are eleven plus, but the sum throws the figure of eighteen. And
besides, Joseph and his children are not eight people, but they are said to be
nine, when in reality only eight appear. These problems, which seem unsolvable,
undoubtedly contain a great meaning; but I do not know if I will be able to
agree all things literally, especially the numbers that in the Scriptures are
absolutely sacred and are full of mysteries, as we believe with all reason,
based on some numbers that we have been able to know by them.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 152]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

PATRIARCHS THEIR PROFESSION, SHEPHERDS OF HERDS. — When speaking of the
patriarchs, it is made more explicit that they were shepherds from their youth,
just as their fathers had been. And rightly so, because no doubt is given the
just servitude and the right rule when the cattle serve man and man dominates
the cattle. Indeed, in the creation of man, Scripture says: Let us make man in
our image and likeness, and have power over the fish of the sea, and over the
birds of the air, and over all the cattle that are upon the earth (Gen. 1:26).
Here it is hinted that reason must rule over irrational life. And iniquity or
adversity made man a servant of man. Iniquity, no doubt, according to the words
of the Scripture: Cursed be Canaan; will be a servant of his brothers (Gen.
9:25). Adversity also, as happened to Joseph, sold by his brothers as a servant
to a foreigner. The wars gave rise to the first to whom this name of slaves was
given in the Latin language. For the man overcome by another man, who by right
of war could have been killed, by pardoning his life, became a servant. They
are also called <i>mancipia</i> (slave),
because they have been captured by hand. There is also a natural order in men,
so that women serve their husbands and children to their fathers. For in this
too there is a justification, which is that the weakest reason serves the strongest.
There is, therefore, a clear justification and legal right in names, so that
those who excel in reason, also excel in the domain. But as in the present
world this is disturbed by the iniquity of men or by the diversity of fleshly
natures, the righteous endure temporal perversity, since on the day of death
they are to obtain the most ordained and everlasting happiness.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 153]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

What does it mean what Jacob said to Pharaoh: <i>The days of the years of my life, in which I dwell as a stranger?</i>
So say the Septuagint. The Latin codices have either a (step) or <i>habeo</i> (I have) or some other similar
word. He said perhaps in those who live as a foreigner, because he was born in
a land that the people had not yet received in inheritance by the divine
promise, and living there was evidently in a foreign land, not only when he was
a pilgrim, as in Mesopotamia, but also when he was there where he was born? Or
is it to interpret these words rather as the Apostle says: While we are in the
body, we are pilgrims away from the Lord (II Cor. 5:6)?<span>  </span>According to this is also meant what is said
in the Psalm: I am a stranger on the earth and a pilgrim like all my parents
(Ps. 39:12). About the days of his life he says again: <i>They have not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers,
the days in which they dwelt as strangers</i>. Here he has not wanted to
understand anything other than what the Latin codices say: that is, the years
they lived. By this he meant to indicate that the present life is a dwelling in
another's homeland in the earth, that is to say, the dwelling of a pilgrim. I believe
that this is convenient for the saints, to whom the Lord promises another life,
which is eternal. Therefore, we must understand well what is said about the
wicked: They will live as strangers and they will hide; they will observe my
footsteps (Ps. 56:6). For this is better understood what the psalm says that
they inhabit as strangers to hide themselves, that is to say, to lay up their
children; they never stay at home.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 156]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is justified especially when the brothers of Joseph had said to Pharaoh: <i>For there is no pasture for the cattle of
your servants, for there is a great famine in the land of Canaan</i>. And they
had added that they had come there precisely because of that lack of pasture.
If, therefore, because of this famine the pastures in the land of Canaan were
lacking, why had the pastures not been lacking in Egypt, if that famine had
spread everywhere? Could pastures not be lacking in many marshy regions of
Egypt, as those who know those places say, even if there is a famine of wheat,
since these pastures usually appear after the floods of the Nile? It is said
that those marshy regions produce pastures, the more fertile the less the Nile

Jacob, when he dies, says to his son Joseph: <i>If I have found grace in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and
you will show me mercy and truth</i>. Jacob obliges his son with the same oath
with which Abraham had required his servant (Gen. 24:29). Abraham ordered him
from where he would look for a wife for his son and Jacob indicating to him
where to bury his body. In these two circumstances there are at the same time
named two things which deserve special attention and interest, in whatever
place of Scripture they are found; sometimes they are called mercy and justice,
sometimes mercy and truth, for in one text it is said: “All the ways of the
Lord are mercy and truth (Ps. 25:10).” In short, these two things so
recommended should be highly appreciated. The servant of Abraham had said, "If
you act with my lord mercy and justice (Gen. 24:29)." Jacob says to his
son, "You will show me mercy and truth." If we measure with human
parameters what is meant by such an important man, so solicitous a
recommendation that his body not be buried in Egypt, but in the land of Canaan,
with his parents, seems strange and almost absurd, and does not agree with
excellence so great of a prophetic mind. But if in all these things are sought
the mysteries that enclose, who discovers them will obtain the joy of a greater
admiration. There is no doubt that in the law the bodies of the dead signify
sins, because men, after touching them or after any contact with them, were
obliged to purify themselves as if it were an impurity (Cf. Num. 19:11-13).
Hence this sentence is derived: “Who purifies himself from contact with a dead
man and touches him again, what good is his purification? So it is he who fasts
for his sins and again goes and does the same (Sir. 34:25-26).” Therefore, the
burial of the dead means the remission of sins, according to what is said in
that passage: "Blessed are those whose iniquities have been forgiven and
whose sins have been covered (Ps. 32:1)." Where, then, were the corpses of
the patriarchs to be buried, which meant these things, but in that land where
he was crucified for whose blood the forgiveness of sins took place? He whose
blood has redeemed us from sin? For the death of the Patriarchs was the figure
of sins of men. From the place where the Lord was crucified, to the one bearing
the name of Abrahamium, where the bodies of the Patriarchs are buried, there
is, it is said, the distance of nearly thirty miles; this number itself
signifies the one who came to receive baptism at the age of thirty. This and
any other similar or more sublime thing can be discovered here on this subject,
provided that we do not believe that men of God of such importance and status
so frivolously worried that their bodies were buried, being and ought to be for
the faithful, a total security, the fact that wherever their bodies are buried
or even if they are buried even by the hatred of the enemies, or even if they
are dismembered to procure pleasure for those same enemies, this does not mean
that their resurrection will be less complete or less glorious.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 161]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

"And he bowed on the top of the rod of him (ejus); But several more
chastened examples say: he bowed on the top of his rod (suae), or at the upper
of his rod; at the end, or at the close. These translators are misled by the
Greek word that is written with the same letters, either to translate eius (of
it) or suae (su). But, on the other hand, the accents are different. And
therefore, those who know these things do not despise them in the codices.
Well, they serve to make a great distinction. Although it could have even a
letter of more, if it were his or his own, so that in Greek was not αυτου, but
εαυτου. It is therefore not without reason that one asks what is the meaning of
this passage. It would easily be understood that an old man, carrying a rod in
the same manner as a stick at that age, when he bowed to worship God, made it
on the end of his rod, since he wore it so that by bowing his head on, he could
worship God. What does it mean then: "He bowed to the end of the rod of
his," that is to say, of his son Joseph? Would it be by chance that Jacob
had received his son's scepter while he was swearing, and that after Joseph's
oath, still holding the scepter in his hands, he worshiped God immediately? He
had no reason to be ashamed of bearing for a moment the insignia of his son's
power, the figure of a great event to come. But the Hebrew text gives a very
easy means of solving the question; he said, "And Israel worshiped and
toward the bedside," of that evidently upon which the old man was placed
so as to pray without difficulty, whenever he wished. However, it should not be
imagined that the interpretation of the Septuagint is meaningless or of little

that his sons conquered Salem, the city of the Shechemites (Gen. 34:25), and by
law of war became his, so that the war which they did against those who had
previously committed such a great injury in the rape of his daughter (Cf. Gen.

that? If now, rejoicing in that victory, he gives that land to his son Joseph,
why then did the sons who did this act displease him? Why, finally, even now,
when he blesses them, he mentions this fact, throwing their conduct against
them? It is clear, therefore, that some prophetic mystery is hidden here, for
even Joseph prefigured Christ with a principal meaning and was from that land

days spent in the tomb, which Scripture recalls, may mean something relative to
the penance through which sins are buried. For this reason, the forty days of
fasting that Moses (Cf. Ex 34:28), Elijah (Cf. 1Kgs. 19:8), and Our Lord
Himself (Cf. Mt. 4:2), lasted forty days, And the Church calls Lent to the
special observance of fasting. Even the translation of the Hebrew of the prophet
Jonah thus says of the Ninevites: “Forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed
(Jon. 3:4).” In this way we understand that during those days, certainly
accommodated to the humiliation of the penitents, the Ninevites wept their sins
in the midst of the fasts and attained the mercy of God. But we must not
believe that this number only suits the crying of the penitents, because in
this case the Lord would not have spent forty days with his disciples after the
resurrection, going in and out, eating and drinking with them. And these days,
of course, were for joy. And it is not necessary to think either that the
version of the Septuagint, which the Church uses in her reading, is wrong, not
saying: forty days, but three days, and Nineveh will be destroyed. Adorned,
indeed, these Seventy men of an authority greater than the simple office of
translators, possessed the prophetic spirit. That is why their versions were as
close to each other as if they had spoken with one mouth. And this was a great
miracle. Well, these men put three days, but they did not ignore that the
Hebrew codices said forty days. And this they did so that it be understood that
sins are blotted out and disappear in the glorification of our Lord Jesus
Christ, of whom it was said: “He who was delivered for our sins and rose again
for our justification (Rom. 4:25).” Well, the glorification of the Lord is
known in his resurrection and ascension to the heavens. That is why he gave
twice the Holy Spirit, although he is one and the same. The first time, after
the resurrection. The second, after the ascent to the heavens. And since he
rose again on the third day, and ascended to heaven after forty days, one of
these two things, which happened in the second place, signifies the Hebrew
codices with the number of days. The other thing, which refers to the three
days, which relates to the same subject, the Seventy wanted to remember, not by
the literalness of translation, but by the authority of prophecy. Let us not
say, then, that one of these two things is false and we fought to defend some
translators against others, since those who translate from Hebrew show us that
what they translate is written. And the authority of the Septuagint, who
recommends even divine authority with such a remarkable miracle, is supported
in the churches by a very great antiquity.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 169]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Joseph commanded the Egyptian dignitaries to tell Pharaoh of his part: "My
father took an oath to me, saying, <i>In the
sepulcher that I dug in the land of Canaan, you will bury me there</i>; because
these words of the father of Joseph do not appear when he gave orders about his
grave. However, we must refer to the content, as we have noted above when
dealing with similar expressions or narrations. Words must serve to express
one's intention and to make it known. That Jacob excavated a tomb for himself,
we find him not affirmed before in any passage of Scripture. But if he had not
done so, as he was in those lands, the Scripture would not now say so.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 170]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

— What does the Scripture mean when they were to bury Jacob: <i>And they came to the age of Ahaz, which is
beyond the Jordan</i>? As those who know the place say, those men went more
than fifty miles beyond the place where they had to bury the dead man. This is
the distance that is more or less from the place where the patriarchs are
buried, including Jacob, to this place where they arrived, as the Scripture says.
After a great mourning and grief there, they returned to the place which they
had left behind, going back across the Jordan. Someone, however, can say that,
to avoid the presence of enemies, they returned with the body through the
desert, to the same place where the people of Israel were also led by Moses
when he brought them out of Egypt. In fact, there is a great detour along that
road, and through the Jordan one arrives at the siege of Abraham, where the
bodies of the patriarchs are (Cf. Gen. 50:13), that is, the land of Canaan. But
in any way this has happened, the fact of going so far to the east, beyond
those places, and the fact of returning to them through the Jordan, we must
understand that it was made by some meaning, that is, that by the Jordan would
come later to those lands Israel with their children.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 171]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

I do not know that in the Scriptures, on the occasion of the death of a holy
personage, there is a mourning celebrated for nine days, which the Latin calls
the <i>nouendial</i>. Therefore, it seems to
me that this custom must be forbidden to Christians if they keep this number of
days of mourning for their dead, because it is properly a pagan custom. The
number seven, on the other hand, enjoys authority in the Scriptures. That is
why it is written elsewhere: “The mourning for a dead man lasts for seven days;
by a fool, all the days of his life (Sir. 22:12).” The number seven is, above
all, a sign of rest because of the mystery of the Sabbath. That is why the dead
are rightly said to rest. In the mourning of Jacob, meanwhile the Egyptians
multiplied this number tenfold at the funeral of Jacob; they wept for seventy
days. </span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">[Question 172]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WENT DOWN WITH JACOB TO EGYPT. — <i>And
Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim
unto the third generation. And the sons of Mahir the son of Manasseh were born
on the knees of Joseph</i>. As the Scripture says that Joseph saw these sons of
his sons or grandchildren of his children while he lived, how can he add them
to those seventy-five men with whom Jacob says that he entered Egypt (Cf. Gen.
46:27), since Joseph came to see those sons in his old age, and when Jacob
entered Egypt, Joseph was young and when his father died, Joseph was almost
fifty-six years old? In conclusion, the Scripture must have recommended that
number seventy-five for some mystery that it contains. But if anyone wished to
know how it could be true to agree even with the historical accuracy that Jacob
entered Egypt with seventy-five people, I tell him that it is not necessary to
think that he entered that single day when he arrived there. And the reason is
that, like Jacob, he is called many times by the name of his sons, that is, of
his descendants, and it is recorded that he entered Egypt through Joseph. The
entrance of Jacob, therefore, must be taken during all the time that Joseph
lived, for which reason he entered Egypt. In fact, during all that time, all
those mentioned were able to be born and live, to the age of seventy-five,
counting the grandsons of Benjamin. This is confirmed by what the text says:
“These are the children Lia gave birth to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria (Gen.
46:15).” And this text also refers to children who were not yet born. And he
alludes to them because there he had given birth to the parents of those who
were born, presenting them as born there. And she does so because the cause of
her parents was born there, the ones that Leah gave birth to there. Now as
Joseph was the cause of Jacob's entering into Egypt, all the time that Joseph
lived in Egypt was the time of Jacob's entry into Egypt, which he made by his
seed, which spread, while he lived was the cause of Jacob entering.</span><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> [Question 173]</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

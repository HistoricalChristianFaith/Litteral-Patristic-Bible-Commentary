him, and would adjure him by You that he would open unto me these things, and I
would lend the ears of my body to the sounds bursting forth from his mouth. And
should he speak in the Hebrew tongue, in vain would it beat on my senses, nor
would anything touch my mind; but if in Latin, I should know what he said. But
whence should I know whether he said what was true? But if I knew this even,
should I know it from him? Verily within me, within in the chamber of my
thought, Truth, neither Hebrew, nor Greek, nor Latin, nor barbarian, without
the organs of voice and tongue, without the sound of syllables, would say, He
speaks the truth, and I, immediately assured of it, confidently would say unto
that man of Yours, You speak the truth. As, then, I cannot inquire of him, I
beseech You — You, O Truth, full of whom he spoke truth — You, my God, I
beseech, forgive my sins; and do Thou, who gave to that Your servant to speak

For it was not as a human worker fashioning body from body, according to the
fancy of his mind, in somewise able to assign a form which it perceives in itself
by its inner eye. And whence should he be able to do this, had not Thou made
that mind? And he assigns to it already existing, and as it were having a
being, a form, as clay, or stone, or wood, or gold, or such like. And whence
should these things be, had not Thou appointed them? Thou made for the workman
his body — Thou the mind commanding the limbs — Thou the matter whereof he
makes anything, — Thou the capacity whereby he may apprehend his art, and see
within what he may do without — Thou the sense of his body, by which, as by an
interpreter, he may from mind unto matter convey that which he does, and report
to his mind what may have been done, that it within may consult the truth,
presiding over itself, whether it be well done. All these things praise You,
the Creator of all. But how do You make them? How, O God, did Thou make heaven
and earth? Truly, neither in the heaven nor in the earth did Thou make heaven
and earth; nor in the air, nor in the waters, since these also belong to the
heaven and the earth; nor in the whole world did Thou make the whole world;
because there was no place wherein it could be made before it was made, that it
might be; nor did Thou hold anything in Your hand wherewith to make heaven and
earth. For whence could You have what You had not made, whereof to make
anything? For what is, save because You are? Therefore You spoke and they were
made, and in Your Word You made these things. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

speak? Was it in that manner in which the voice came from the cloud, saying,
This is my beloved Son? Matthew 17:5 For that voice was uttered and passed
away, began and ended. The syllables sounded and passed by, the second after
the first, the third after the second, and thence in order, until the last
after the rest, and silence after the last. Hence it is clear and plain that
the motion of a creature expressed it, itself temporal, obeying Your Eternal
will. And these your words formed at the time, the outer ear conveyed to the
intelligent mind, whose inner ear lay attentive to Your eternal word. But it
compared these words sounding in time with Your eternal word in silence, and
said, It is different, very different. These words are far beneath me, nor are
they, since they flee and pass away; but the Word of my Lord remains above me
forever. If, then, in sounding and fleeting words Thou said that heaven and
earth should be made, and thus made heaven and earth, there was already a
corporeal creature before heaven and earth by whose temporal motions that voice
might take its course in time. But there was nothing corporeal before heaven
and earth; or if there were, certainly Thou without a transitory voice had
created that whence You would make the passing voice, by which to say that the
heaven and the earth should be made. For whatsoever that were of which such a
voice was made, unless it were made by You, it could not be at all. By what
word of Yours was it decreed that a body might be made, whereby these words
might be made?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

speaks through the flesh; and this sounded outwardly in the ears of men, that
it might be believed and sought inwardly, and that it might be found in the
eternal Truth, where the good and only Master teaches all His disciples. There,
O Lord, I hear Your voice, the voice of one speaking unto me, since He speaks
unto us who teaches us. But He that teaches us not, although He speaks, speaks
not to us. Moreover, who teaches us, unless it be the immutable Truth? For even
when we are admonished through a changeable creature, we are led to the Truth
immutable. There we learn truly while we stand and hear Him, and rejoice

whence we are. And, therefore, the Beginning, because unless It remained, there
would not, where we strayed, be whither to return. But when we return from

You are the Creator of all times, if any time was before You made heaven and

neither go nor come; but ours both go and come, that all may come. All Your

times are co-eternal with You, because You remain for ever; but should these
continue, they would not be times. For what is time? Who can easily and briefly
explain it? Who even in thought can comprehend it, even to the pronouncing of a
word concerning it? But what in speaking do we refer to more familiarly and
knowingly than time? And certainly we understand when we speak of it; we
understand also when we hear it spoken of by another. What, then, is time? If
no one ask of me, I know; if I wish to explain to him who asks, I know not. Yet
I say with confidence, that I know that if nothing passed away, there would not
be past time; and if nothing were coming, there would not be future time; and
if nothing were, there would not be present time. Those two times, therefore,
past and future, how are they, when even the past now is not; and the future is
not as yet? But should the present be always present, and should it not pass
into time past, time truly it could not be, but eternity. If, then, time
present — if it be time — only comes into existence because it passes into time
past, how do we say that even this is, whose cause of being is that it shall
not be — namely, so that we cannot truly say that time is, unless because it
tends not to be?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

future. A long time past, for example, we call a hundred years ago; in like
manner a long time to come, a hundred years hence. But a short time past we
call, say, ten days ago: and a short time to come, ten days hence. But in what
sense is that long or short which is not? For the past is not now, and the
future is not yet. Therefore let us not say, It is long; but let us say of the
past, It has been long, and of the future, It will be long. O my Lord, my
light, shall not even here Your truth deride man? For that past time which was
long, was it long when it was already past, or when it was as yet present? For
then it might be long when there was that which could be long, but when past it
no longer was; wherefore that could not be long which was not at all. Let us
not, therefore, say, Time past has been long; for we shall not find what may
have been long, seeing that since it was past it is not; but let us say that
present time was long, because when it was present it was long. For it had not
as yet passed away so as not to be, and therefore there was that which could be
long. But after it passed, that ceased also to be long which ceased to be.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

O human soul, whether present time can be long; for to you is it given to
perceive and to measure periods of time. What will you reply to me? Is a
hundred years when present a long time? See, first, whether a hundred years can
be present. For if the first year of these is current, that is present, but the
other ninety and nine are future, and therefore they are not as yet. But if the
second year is current, one is already past, the other present, the rest
future. And thus, if we fix on any middle year of this hundred as present,
those before it are past, those after it are future; wherefore a hundred years
cannot be present. See at least whether that year itself which is current can
be present. For if its first month be current, the rest are future; if the
second, the first has already passed, and the remainder are not yet. Therefore
neither is the year which is current as a whole present; and if it is not
present as a whole, then the year is not present. For twelve months make the
year, of which each individual month which is current is itself present, but the
rest are either past or future. Although neither is that month which is current
present, but one day only: if the first, the rest being to come, if the last,
the rest being past; if any of the middle, then between past and future.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

which alone we found could be called long, is abridged to the space scarcely of
one day. But let us discuss even that, for there is not one day present as a
whole. For it is made up of four-and-twenty hours of night and day, whereof the
first has the rest future, the last has them past, but any one of the
intervening has those before it past, those after it future. And that one hour
passes away in fleeting particles. Whatever of it has flown away is past,
whatever remains is future. If any portion of time be conceived which cannot
now be divided into even the minutest particles of moments, this only is that
which may be called present; which, however, flies so rapidly from future to
past, that it cannot be extended by any delay. For if it be extended, it is
divided into the past and future; but the present has no space. Where,
therefore, is the time which we may call long? Is it nature? Indeed we do not
say, It is long, because it is not yet, so as to be long; but we say, It will
be long. When, then, will it be? For if even then, since as yet it is future,
it will not be long, because what may be long is not as yet; but it shall be
long, when from the future, which as yet is not, it shall already have begun to
be, and will have become present, so that there could be that which may be
long; then does the present time cry out in the words above that it cannot be
long.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

seek further; O my Hope, let not my purpose be confounded. For if there are
times past and future, I desire to know where they are. But if as yet I do not
succeed, I still know, wherever they are, that they are not there as future or
past, but as present. For if there also they be future, they are not as yet
there; if even there they be past, they are no longer there. Wheresoever,
therefore, they are, whatsoever they are, they are only so as present. Although
past things are related as true, they are drawn out from the memory, — not the
things themselves, which have passed, but the words conceived from the images
of the things which they have formed in the mind as footprints in their passage
through the senses. My childhood, indeed, which no longer is, is in time past,
which now is not; but when I call to mind its image, and speak of it, I behold
it in the present, because it is as yet in my memory. Whether there be a like
cause of foretelling future things, that of things which as yet are not the
images may be perceived as already existing, I confess, my God, I know not.
This certainly I know, that we generally think before on our future actions,
and that this premeditation is present; but that the action whereon we
premeditate is not yet, because it is future; which when we shall have entered

therefore, this secret preconception of future things may be, nothing can be
seen, save what is. But what now is is not future, but present. When,
therefore, they say that things future are seen, it is not themselves, which as
yet are not (that is, which are future); but their causes or their signs perhaps
are seen, the which already are. Therefore, to those already beholding them,
they are not future, but present, from which future things conceived in the
mind are foretold. Which conceptions again now are, and they who foretell those
things behold these conceptions present before them. Let now so multitudinous a
variety of things afford me some example. I behold daybreak; I foretell that
the sun is about to rise. That which I behold is present; what I foretell is
future — not that the sun is future, which already is; but his rising, which is
not yet. Yet even its rising I could not predict unless I had an image of it in
my mind, as now I have while I speak. But that dawn which I see in the sky is
not the rising of the sun, although it may go before it, nor that imagination
in my mind; which two are seen as present, that the other which is future may
be foretold. Future things, therefore, are not as yet; and if they are not as
yet, they are not. And if they are not, they cannot be seen at all; but they
can be foretold from things present which now are, and are seen.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

but when it shall have passed, it is not measured; for there will not be
anything that can be measured. But whence, in what way, and whither does it
pass while it is being measured? Whence, but from the future? Which way, save

learned man that the motions of the sun, moon, and stars constituted time, and
I assented not. For why should not rather the motions of all bodies be time?
What if the lights of heaven should cease, and a potter's wheel run round,
would there be no time by which we might measure those revolutions, and say
either that it turned with equal pauses, or, if it were moved at one time more
slowly, at another more quickly, that some revolutions were longer, others less
so? Or while we were saying this, should we not also be speaking in time? Or
should there in our words be some syllables long, others short, but because
those sounded in a longer time, these in a shorter? God grant to men to see in
a small thing ideas common to things great and small. Both the stars and
luminaries of heaven are for signs and for seasons, and for days and years.
Genesis 1:14 No doubt they are; but neither should I say that the circuit
of that wooden wheel was a day, nor yet should he say that therefore there was
no time.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

power and nature of time, by which we measure the motions of bodies, and say
(for example) that this motion is twice as long as that. For, I ask, since day
declares not the stay only of the sun upon the earth, according to which day is
one thing, night another, but also its entire circuit from east even to east —
according to which we say, So many days have passed (the nights being included
when we say so many days, and their spaces not counted apart) — since, then,
the day is finished by the motion of the sun, and by his circuit from east to
east, I ask, whether the motion itself is the day, or the period in which that
motion is completed, or both? For if the first be the day, then would there be
a day although the sun should finish that course in so small a space of time as
an hour. If the second, then that would not be a day if from one sunrise to
another there were but so short a period as an hour, but the sun must go round
four-and-twenty times to complete a day. If both, neither could that be called
a day if the sun should run his entire round in the space of an hour; nor that,
if, while the sun stood still, so much time should pass as the sun is
accustomed to accomplish his whole course in from morning to morning. I shall
not therefore now ask, what that is which is called day, but what time is, by
which we, measuring the circuit of the sun, should say that it was accomplished
in half the space of time it was wont, if it had been completed in so small a
space as twelve hours; and comparing both times, we should call that single,
this double time, although the sun should run his course from east to east
sometimes in that single, sometimes in that double time. Let no man then tell
me that the motions of the heavenly bodies are times, because, when at the
prayer of one the sun stood still in order that he might achieve his victorious
battle, the sun stood still, but time went on. For in such space of time as was
sufficient was that battle fought and ended. Joshua 10:12-14 I see that
time, then, is a certain extension. But do I see it, or do I seem to see it?

should assent, if any one should say that time is the motion of a body? Thou
dost not command me. For I hear that no body is moved but in time. This You
say; but that the very motion of a body is time, I hear not; You say it not.
For when a body is moved, I by time measure how long it may be moving from the
time in which it began to be moved till it left off. And if I saw not whence it
began, and it continued to be moved, so that I see not when it leaves off, I
cannot measure unless, perchance, from the time I began until I cease to see.
But if I look long, I only proclaim that the time is long, but not how long it
may be because when we say, How long, we speak by comparison, as, This is as
long as that, or, This is double as long as that, or any other thing of the kind.
But if we were able to note down the distances of places whence and whither
comes the body which is moved, or its parts, if it moved as in a wheel, we can
say in how much time the motion of the body or its part, from this place unto
that, was performed. Since, then, the motion of a body is one thing, that by
which we measure how long it is another, who cannot see which of these is
rather to be called time? For, although a body be sometimes moved, sometimes
stand still, we measure not its motion only, but also its standing still, by
time; and we say, It stood still as much as it moved; or, It stood still twice
or thrice as long as it moved; and if any other space which our measuring has
either determined or imagined, more or less, as we are accustomed to say. Time,
therefore, is not the motion of a body.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

measure, O my God, and know not what I measure? I measure the motion of a body
by time; and the time itself do I not measure? But, in truth, could I measure
the motion of a body, how long it is, and how long it is in coming from this
place to that, unless I should measure the time in which it is moved? How,
therefore, do I measure this very time itself? Or do we by a shorter time
measure a longer, as by the space of a cubit the space of a crossbeam? For
thus, indeed, we seem by the space of a short syllable to measure the space of
a long syllable, and to say that this is double. Thus we measure the spaces of
stanzas by the spaces of the verses, and the spaces of the verses by the spaces
of the feet, and the spaces of the feet by the spaces of the syllables, and the
spaces of long by the spaces of short syllables; not measuring by pages (for in
that manner we measure spaces, not times), but when in uttering the words they
pass by, and we say, It is a long stanza because it is made up of so many
verses; long verses, because they consist of so many feet; long feet, because
they are prolonged by so many syllables; a long syllable, because double a
short one. But neither thus is any certain measure of time obtained; since it
is possible that a shorter verse, if it be pronounced more fully, may take up
more time than a longer one, if pronounced more hurriedly. Thus for a stanzas,
thus for a foot, thus for a syllable. Whence it appeared to me that time is
nothing else than protraction; but of what I know not. It is wonderful to me,
if it be not of the mind itself. For what do I measure, I beseech You, O my
God, even when I say either indefinitely, This time is longer than that; or
even definitely, This is double that? That I measure time, I know. But I
measure not the future, for it is not yet; nor do I measure the present,
because it is extended by no space; nor do I measure the past, because it no
longer is. What, therefore, do I measure? Is it times passing, not past? For

and give earnest heed. God is our helper; He made us, and not we ourselves.
Give heed, where truth dawns. Lo, suppose the voice of a body begins to sound,
and does sound, and sounds on, and lo! It ceases — it is now silence, and that
voice is past and is no longer a voice. It was future before it sounded, and
could not be measured, because as yet it was not; and now it cannot, because it
no longer is. Then, therefore, while it was sounding, it might, because there
was then that which might be measured. But even then it did not stand still,
for it was going and passing away. Could it, then, on that account be measured
the more? For, while passing, it was being extended into some space of time, in
which it might be measured, since the present has no space. If, therefore, then
it might be measured, lo! suppose another voice has begun to sound, and still
sounds, in a continued tenor without any interruption, we can measure it while
it is sounding; for when it shall have ceased to sound, it will be already
past, and there will not be that which can be measured. Let us measure it
truly, and let us say how much it is. But as yet it sounds, nor can it be
measured, save from that instant in which it began to sound, even to the end in
which it left off. For the interval itself we measure from some beginning unto
some end. On which account, a voice which is not yet ended cannot be measured,
so that it may be said how long or how short it may be; nor can it be said to
be equal to another, or single or double in respect of it, or the like. But
when it is ended, it no longer is. In what manner, therefore, may it be
measured? And yet we measure times; still not those which as yet are not, nor
those which no longer are, nor those which are protracted by some delay, nor
those which have no limits. We, therefore, measure neither future times, nor
past, nor present, nor those passing by; and yet we do measure times.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

this verse of eight syllables alternates between short and long syllables. The
four short, then, the first, third, fifth and seventh, are single in respect of
the four long, the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth. Each of these has a
double time to every one of those. I pronounce them, report on them, and thus
it is, as is perceived by common sense. By common sense, then, I measure a long
by a short syllable, and I find that it has twice as much. But when one sounds
after another, if the former be short the latter long, how shall I hold the
short one, and how measuring shall I apply it to the long, so that I may find
out that this has twice as much, when indeed the long does not begin to sound
unless the short leaves off sounding? That very long one I measure not as
present, since I measure it not save when ended. But its ending is its passing
away. What, then, is it that I can measure? Where is the short syllable by
which I measure? Where is the long one which I measure? Both have sounded, have
flown, have passed away, and are no longer; and still I measure, and I
confidently answer (so far as is trusted to a practised sense), that as to
space of time this syllable is single, that double. Nor could I do this, unless
because they have past, and are ended. Therefore do I not measure themselves,
which now are not, but something in my memory, which remains fixed.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

measure times. Do not overwhelm me with your clamour. That is, do not overwhelm
yourself with the multitude of your impressions. In you, I say, I measure
times; the impression which things as they pass by make on you, and which, when
they have passed by, remains, that I measure as time present, not those things
which have passed by, that the impression should be made. This I measure when I
measure times. Either, then, these are times, or I do not measure times. What
when we measure silence, and say that this silence has lasted as long as that
voice lasts? Do we not extend our thought to the measure of a voice, as if it
sounded, so that we may be able to declare something concerning the intervals
of silence in a given space of time? For when both the voice and tongue are
still, we go over in thought poems and verses, and any discourse, or dimensions
of motions; and declare concerning the spaces of times, how much this may be in
respect of that, not otherwise than if uttering them we should pronounce them.
Should any one wish to utter a lengthened sound, and had with forethought
determined how long it should be, that man has in silence verily gone through a
space of time, and, committing it to memory, he begins to utter that speech,
which sounds until it be extended to the end proposed; truly it has sounded, and
will sound. For what of it is already finished has verily sounded, but what
remains will sound; and thus does it pass on, until the present intention carry
over the future into the past; the past increasing by the diminution of the
future, until, by the consumption of the future, all be past.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

it expects, through that which it considers, may pass into that which it
remembers. Who, therefore, denies that future things as yet are not? But yet
there is already in the mind the expectation of things future. And who denies
that past things are now no longer? But, however, there is still in the mind
the memory of things past. And who denies that time present wants space,
because it passes away in a moment? But yet our consideration endures, through
which that which may be present may proceed to become absent. Future time,

is that secret place of Your mystery, and how far thence have the consequences
of my transgressions cast me? Heal my eyes, that I may enjoy Your light.
Surely, if there be a mind, so greatly abounding in knowledge and
foreknowledge, to which all things past and future are so known as one psalm is
well known to me, that mind is exceedingly wonderful, and very astonishing;
because whatever is so past, and whatever is to come of after ages, is no more
concealed from Him than was it hidden from me when singing that psalm, what and
how much of it had been sung from the beginning, what and how much remained
unto the end. But far be it that Thou, the Creator of the universe, the Creator
of souls and bodies — far be it that You should know all things future and
past. Far, far more wonderfully, and far more mysteriously, You know them. For
it is not as the feelings of one singing known things, or hearing a known song,
are — through expectation of future words, and in remembrance of those that are
past — varied, and his senses divided, that anything happens unto You,
unchangeably eternal, that is, the truly eternal Creator of minds. As, then,
Thou in the Beginning knew the heaven and the earth without any change of Your
knowledge, so in the Beginning Thou made heaven and earth without any
distraction of Your action. Let him who understands confess unto You; and let
him who understands not, confess unto You. Oh, how exalted are You, and yet the
humble in heart are Your dwelling-place; for Thou raisest up those that are
bowed down, and they whose exaltation You are fall not.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

commanded that it should be written, that darkness was upon the face of the

where should it have been save by being above all, showing itself aloft, and

my mouth and by my pen to confess unto You the whole, whatever You have taught
me concerning that matter, the name of which hearing beforehand, and not
understanding (they who could not understand it telling me of it), I conceived
it as having innumerable and varied forms. And therefore did I not conceive it;
my mind revolved in disturbed order foul and horrible forms, but yet forms; and
I called it formless, not that it lacked form, but because it had such as, did it
appear, my mind would turn from, as unwonted and incongruous, and at which
human weakness would be disturbed. But even that which I did conceive was
formless, not by the privation of all form, but in comparison of more beautiful
forms; and true reason persuaded me that I ought altogether to remove from it
all remnants of any form whatever, if I wished to conceive matter wholly
without form; and I could not. For sooner could I imagine that that which
should be deprived of all form was not at all, than conceive anything between
form and nothing — neither formed, nor nothing, formless, nearly nothing. And
my mind hence ceased to question my spirit, filled (as it was) with the images
of formed bodies, and changing and varying them according to its will; and I applied
myself to the bodies themselves, and looked more deeply into their mutability,
by which they cease to be what they had been, and begin to be what they were
not; and this same transit from form unto form I have looked upon to be through
some formless condition, not through a very nothing; but I desired to know, not
to guess. And if my voice and my pen should confess the whole unto You,
whatsoever knots You have untied for me concerning this question, who of my
readers would endure to take in the whole? Nor yet, therefore, shall my heart
cease to give You honour, and a song of praise, for those things which it is
not able to express. For the mutability of mutable things is itself capable of
all those forms into which mutable things are changed. And this mutability,
what is it? Is it soul? Is it body? Is it the outer appearance of soul or body?
Could it be said, Nothing were something, and That which is, is not, I would
say that this were it; and yet in some manner was it already, since it could
receive these visible and compound shapes.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

invisible and without form, Genesis 1:2 and there was a deep over which
there was not light; or, darkness was over the deep, that is, more than in the
deep. For this deep of waters, now visible, has, even in its depths, a light
suitable to its nature, perceptible in some manner unto fishes and creeping
things in the bottom of it. But the entire deep was almost nothing, since
hitherto it was altogether formless; yet there was then that which could be
formed. For Thou, O Lord, hast made the world of a formless matter, which
matter, out of nothing, You have made almost nothing, out of which to make
those great things which we, sons of men, wonder at. For very wonderful is this
corporeal heaven, of which firmament, between water and water, the second day
after the creation of light, Thou said, Let it be made, and it was made.
Genesis 1:6-8 Which firmament You called heaven, that is, the heaven of
this earth and sea, which You made on the third day, by giving a visible shape
to the formless matter which You made before all days. For even already had
Thou made a heaven before all days, but that was the heaven of this heaven; because
in the beginning You had made heaven and earth. But the earth itself which You
had made was formless matter, because it was invisible and without form, and
darkness was upon the deep. Of which invisible and formless earth, of which
formlessness, of which almost nothing, You might make all these things of which
this changeable world consists, and yet consists not; whose very changeableness

considered as much as You give, O my God, as much as Thou excitest me to knock,
and as much as You open unto me when I knock, Matthew 7:7 two things I
find which You have made, not within the compass of time, since neither is
co-eternal with You. One, which is so formed that, without any failing of
contemplation, without any interval of change, although changeable, yet not
changed, it may fully enjoy Your eternity and unchangeableness; the other,
which was so formless, that it had not that by which it could be changed from
one form into another, either of motion or of repose, whereby it might be
subject unto time. But this You did not leave to be formless, since before all
days, in the beginning You created heaven and earth — these two things of which
I spoke. But the earth was invisible and without form, and darkness was upon
the deep. Genesis 1:2 By which words its shapelessness is conveyed unto
us, that by degrees those minds may be drawn on which cannot wholly conceive
the privation of all form without coming to nothing — whence another heaven might
be created, and another earth visible and well-formed, and water beautifully
ordered, and whatever besides is, in the formation of this world, recorded to

as a whole, in manifestation, face to face; not this thing now, that anon, but
(as has been said) to know at once without any change of times; and on account
of the invisible and formless earth, without any change of times; which change
is wont to have this thing now, that anon, because, where there is no form
there can be no distinction between this or that;— it is, then, on account of
these two — a primitively formed, and a wholly formless; the one heaven, but
the heaven of heavens, the other earth, but the earth invisible and formless —

these things are false, which, with a strong voice, Truth tells me in my inner
ear, concerning the very eternity of the Creator, that His substance is in no
wise changed by time, nor that His will is separate from His substance?
Wherefore, He wills not one thing now, another anon, but once and for ever He
wills all things that He wills; not again and again, nor now this, now that;
nor wills afterwards what He wills not before, nor wills not what before He
willed. Because such a will is mutable and no mutable thing is eternal; but our
God is eternal. Likewise He tells me, tells me in my inner ear, that the
expectation of future things is turned to sight when they have come; and this
same sight is turned to memory when they have passed. Moreover, all thought
which is thus varied is mutable, and nothing mutable is eternal; but our God is
eternal. These things I sum up and put together, and I find that my God, the

you say, you objectors? Are these things false? No, they say. What is this? Is
it false, then, that every nature already formed, or matter formable, is only
from Him who is supremely good, because He is supreme? . . . . Neither do we
deny this, say they. What then? Do you deny this, that there is a certain
sublime creature, clinging with so chaste a love with the true and truly
eternal God, that although it be not co-eternal with Him, yet it separates
itself not from Him, nor flows into any variety and vicissitude of times, but
rests in the truest contemplation of Him only? Since Thou, O God, showest
Yourself unto him, and sufficest him, who loves You as much as You command,
and, therefore, he declines not from You, nor toward himself. This is the house
of God, not earthly, nor of any celestial bulk corporeal, but a spiritual house
and a partaker of Your eternity, because without blemish forever. For You have
made it fast for ever and ever; You have given it a law, which it shall not
pass. Nor yet is it co-eternal with You, O God, because not without beginning,
for it was made.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

no time before it, for wisdom was created before all things, Sirach 1:4 —
not certainly that Wisdom manifestly co-eternal and equal unto You, our God,
His Father, and by Whom all things were created, and in Whom, as the Beginning,
You created heaven and earth; but truly that wisdom which has been created,
namely, the intellectual nature, which, in the contemplation of light, is light.
For this, although created, is also called wisdom. But as great as is the
difference between the Light which enlightens and that which is enlightened, so
great is the difference between the Wisdom that creates and that which has been
created; as between the Righteousness which justifies, and the righteousness
which has been made by justification. For we also are called Your
righteousness; for thus says a certain servant of Yours: That we might be made
the righteousness of God in Him. 2 Corinthians 5:21 Therefore, since
a certain created wisdom was created before all things, the rational and
intellectual mind of that chaste city of Yours, our mother which is above, and
is free, Galatians 4:26 and eternal in the heavens
2 Corinthians 5:1 (in what heavens, unless in those that praise You,
the heaven of heavens, because this also is the heaven of heavens, which is the
Lord's) — although we find not time before it, because that which has been
created before all things also precedes the creature of time, yet is the
Eternity of the Creator Himself before it, from Whom, having been created, it
took the beginning, although not of time — for time as yet was not — yet of its

be of You, our God, as to be manifestly another than You, and not the
Self-same. Since, although we find time not only not before it, but not in it
(it being proper ever to behold Your face, nor is ever turned aside from it,
wherefore it happens that it is varied by no change), yet is there in it that
mutability itself whence it would become dark and cold, but that, clinging unto
You with sublime love, it shines and glows from You like a perpetual noon. O
house, full of light and splendour! I have loved your beauty, and the place of
the habitation of the glory of my Lord, your builder and owner. Let my
wandering sigh after you; and I speak unto Him that made you, that He may
possess me also in you, seeing He has made me likewise. I have gone astray,

Is not this house of God, not indeed co-eternal with God, yet, according to its
measure, eternal in the heavens, 2 Corinthians 5:l where in vain you
seek for changes of times, because you will not find them? For that surpasses
all extension, and every revolving space of time, to which it is ever good to
cleave fast to God. It is, say they. What, therefore, of those things which my
heart cried out unto my God, when within it heard the voice of His praise, what
then do you contend is false? Or is it because the matter was formless,
wherein, as there was no form, there was no order? But where there was no order
there could not be any change of times; and yet this 'almost nothing,' inasmuch
as it was not altogether nothing, was verily from Him, from Whom is whatever
is, in whatever state anything is. This also, say they, we do not deny.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

will endeavour to persuade them to be quiet, and to suffer Your word to reach
them. But should they be unwilling, and should they repel me, I beseech, O my
God, that Thou be not silent to me. Do Thou speak truly in my heart, for Thou
only so speakest, and I will send them away blowing upon the dust from without,
and raising it up into their own eyes; and will myself enter into my chamber,
Isaiah 26:20 and sing there unto You songs of love — groaning with
groaning unutterable Romans 8:26 in my pilgrimage, and remembering
Jerusalem, with heart raised up towards it, Jerusalem my country, Jerusalem my
mother, and Yourself, the Ruler over it, the Enlightener, the Father, the

Although these things be true, yet Moses regarded not those two things, when by
divine revelation he said, 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.' Genesis 1:1 Under the name of heaven he did not indicate that
spiritual or intellectual creature which always beholds the face of God; nor
under the name of earth, that shapeless matter. What then? That man, say they,
meant as we say; this it is that he declared by those words. What is that? By
the name of heaven and earth, say they, did he first wish to set forth,
universally and briefly, all this visible world, that afterwards by the
enumeration of the days he might distribute, as if in detail, all those things
which it pleased the Holy Spirit thus to reveal. For such men were that rude
and carnal people to which he spoke, that he judged it prudent that only those
works of God as were visible should be entrusted to them. They agree, however,
that the earth invisible and formless, and the darksome deep (out of which it
is subsequently pointed out that all these visible things, which are known to
all, were made and set in order during those days), may not unsuitably be
understood of this formless matter.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

should say That this same formlessness and confusion of matter was first
introduced under the name of heaven and earth, because out of it this visible
world, with all those natures which most manifestly appear in it, and which is
wont to be called by the name of heaven and earth, was created and perfected?
But what if another should say, that That invisible and visible nature is not
inaptly called heaven and earth; and that consequently the universal creation,
which God in His wisdom has made — that is, 'in the begining,'— was
comprehended under these two words. Yet, since all things have been made, not
of the substance of God, but out of nothing (because they are not that same
thing that God is, and there is in them all a certain mutability, whether they
remain, as does the eternal house of God, or be changed, as are the soul and
body of man), therefore, that the common matter of all things invisible and visible
— as yet shapeless, but still capable of form, — out of which was to be created
heaven and earth (that is, the invisible and visible creature already formed),
was spoken of by the same names by which the earth invisible and formless and
the darkness upon the deep would be called; with this difference, however, that
the earth invisible and formless is understood as corporeal matter, before it
had any manner of form, but the darkness upon the deep as spiritual matter,
before it was restrained at all of its unlimited fluidity, and before the
enlightening of wisdom.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

he may still say, That the already perfected and formed natures, invisible and
visible, are not signified under the name of heaven and earth when it is read,
'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;' but that the yet same
formless beginning of things, the matter capable of being formed and made, was
called by these names, because contained in it there were these confused things
not as yet distinguished by their qualities and forms, the which now being
digested in their own orders, are called heaven and earth, the former being the
spiritual, the latter the corporeal creature.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

is not changed. It is true, that the formlessness, which is almost nothing,
cannot have changes, of times. It is true, that that of which anything is made

made of it; whence that formlessness of which heaven and earth were made might

endeavour to contend against these last two opinions, thus —If you will not
admit that this formlessness of matter appears to be called by the name of
heaven and earth, then there was something which God had not made out of which
He could make heaven and earth; for Scripture has not told us that God made
this matter, unless we understand it to be implied in the term of heaven and
earth, or of earth only, when it is said, 'In the beginning God created heaven
and earth,' as that which follows, but the earth was invisible and formless, although
it was pleasing to him so to call the formless matter, we may not yet
understand any but that which God made in that text which has been already
written, 'God made heaven and earth.' The maintainers of either one or the
other of these two opinions which we have put last will, when they have heard
these things, answer and say, We deny not indeed that this formless matter was
created by God, the God of whom are all things, very good; for, as we say that
that is a greater good which is created and formed, so we acknowledge that that
is a minor good which is capable of creation and form, but yet good. But yet
the Scripture has not declared that God made this formlessness, any more than
it has declared many other things; as the 'Cherubim,' and 'Seraphim,' and those
of which the apostle distinctly speaks, 'Thrones,' 'Dominions,'
'Principalities,' 'Powers,' Colossians 1:16 all of which it is manifest
God made. Or if in that which is said, 'He made heaven and earth,' all things
are comprehended, what do we say of the waters upon which the Spirit of God
moved? For if they are understood as incorporated in the word earth, how then
can formless matter be meant in the term earth when we see the waters so
beautiful? Or if it be so meant, why then is it written that out of the same
formlessness the firmament was made and called heaven, and yet it is not
written that the waters were made? For those waters, which we perceive flowing
in so beautiful a manner, remain not formless and invisible. But if, then, they
received that beauty when God said, Let the water which is under the firmament
be gathered together, Genesis 1:9 so that the gathering be the very
formation, what will be answered concerning the waters which are above the
firmament, because if formless they would not have deserved to receive a seat
so honourable, nor is it written by what word they were formed? If, then,
Genesis is silent as to anything that God has made, which, however, neither
sound faith nor unerring understanding doubts that God has made, let not any
sober teaching dare to say that these waters were co-eternal with God because
we find them mentioned in the book of Genesis; but when they were created, we
find not. Why — truth instructing us — may we not understand that that formless
matter, which the Scripture calls the earth invisible and without form, and the
darksome deep, have been made by God out of nothing, and therefore that they
are not co-eternal with Him, although that narrative has failed to tell when
they were made?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

differences may arise when by signs anything is related, even by true reporters

so many truths which occur to inquirers in these words, understood as they are
in different ways, shall so discover that one interpretation as to confidently
say that Moses thought this, and that in that narrative he wished this to be
understood, as confidently as he says that this is true, whether he thought
this thing or the other? For behold, O my God, I Your servant, who in this book
have vowed unto You a sacrifice of confession, and beseech You that of Your
mercy I may pay my vows unto You, behold, can I, as I confidently assert that
Thou in Your immutable word hast created all things, invisible and visible,
with equal confidence assert that Moses meant nothing else than this when he
wrote, In the beginning God created. the heaven and the earth. No. Because it
is not as clear to me that this was in his mind when he wrote these things, as
I see it to be certain in Your truth. For his thoughts might be set upon the
very beginning of the creation when he said, In the beginning; and he might
wish it to be understood that, in this place, the heaven and the earth were no
formed and perfected nature, whether spiritual or corporeal, but each of them
newly begun, and as yet formless. Because I see, that which-soever of these had
been said, it might have been said truly; but which of them he may have thought
in these words, I do not so perceive. Although, whether it were one of these,
or some other meaning which has not been mentioned by me, that this great man
saw in his mind when he used these words, I make no doubt but that he saw it

trouble me by saying, Moses thought not as you say, but as I say. For should he
ask me, Whence do you know that Moses thought this which you deduce from his
words? I ought to take it contentedly, and reply perhaps as I have before, or
somewhat more fully should he be obstinate. But when he says, Moses meant not
what you say, but what I say, and yet denies not what each of us says, and that
both are true, O my God, life of the poor, in whose bosom there is no
contradiction, pour down into my heart Your soothings, that I may patiently
bear with such as say this to me; not because they are divine, and because they
have seen in the heart of Your servant what they say, but because they are
proud, and have not known the opinion of Moses, but love their own — not
because it is true, but because it is their own. Otherwise they would equally
love another true opinion, as I love what they say when they speak what is
true; not because it is theirs, but because it is true, and therefore now not
theirs because true. But if they therefore love that because it is true, it is
now both theirs and mine, since it is common to all the lovers of truth. But
because they contend that Moses meant not what I say, but I what they
themselves say, this I neither like nor love; because, though it were so, yet
that rashness is not of knowledge, but of audacity; and not vision, but vanity
brought it forth. And therefore, O Lord, are Your judgments to be dreaded,
since Your truth is neither mine, nor his, nor another's, but of all of us,
whom Thou publicly callest to have it in common, warning us terribly not to
hold it as specially for ourselves, lest we be deprived of it. For whosoever
claims to himself as his own that which Thou appointed to all to enjoy, and
desires that to be his own which belongs to all, is forced away from what is
common to all to that which is his own — that is, from truth to falsehood. For
he that speaks a lie, speaks of his own. John 8:44 </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

what I shall say to him, if it be pleasing unto You. For this brotherly and
peaceful word do I return unto him: If we both see that that which you say is
true, and if we both see that what I say is true, where, I ask, do we see it?
Certainly not I in you, nor you in me, but both in the unchangeable truth
itself, which is above our minds. When, therefore, we may not contend about the
very light of the Lord our God, why do we contend about the thoughts of. our

himself had appeared to us and said, This I meant, not so should we see it, but
believe it? Let us not, then, be puffed up for one against the other,

shall make God a liar when we think otherwise concerning our fellow-servants'
mind than He has taught us. Behold, now, how foolish it is, in so great an
abundance of the truest opinions which can be extracted from these words,
rashly to affirm which of them Moses particularly meant; and with pernicious

my heart and of my tongue those books might be distributed, which so long after
were to profit all nations, and through the whole world, from so great a
pinnacle of authority, were to surmount the words of all false and proud

a limited space is more plentiful, and affords supply for more streams over
larger spaces than any one of those streams which, after a wide interval, is
derived from the same fountain; so the narrative of Your dispenser, destined to
benefit many who were likely to discourse thereon, does, from a limited measure
of language, overflow into streams of clear truth, whence each one may draw out
for himself that truth which he can concerning these subjects — this one that
truth, that one another, by larger circumlocutions of discourse. For some, when
they read or hear these words, think that God as a man or some mass gifted with
immense power, by some new and sudden resolve, had, outside itself, as if at
distant places, created heaven and earth, two great bodies above and below,
wherein all things were to be contained. And when they hear, God said, Let it
be made, and it was made, they think of words begun and ended, sounding in
times and passing away, after the departure of which that came into being which
was commanded to be; and whatever else of the kind their familiarity with the
world would suggest. In whom, being as yet little ones, while their weakness by
this humble kind of speech is carried on as if in a mother's bosom, their faith
is healthfully built up, by which they have and hold as certain that God made
all natures, which in wondrous variety their senses perceive on every side.
Which words, if any one despising them, as if trivial, with proud weakness
shall have stretched himself beyond his fostering cradle, he will, alas, fall

these words are no longer a nest, but shady fruit-bowers, see the fruits
concealed in them, fly around rejoicing, and chirpingly search and pluck them.
For they see when they read or hear these words, O God, that all times past and
future are surmounted by Your eternal and stable abiding, and still that there
is no temporal creature which You have not made. And by Your will, because it
is that which You are, You have made all things, not by any changed will, nor
by a will which before was not — not out of Yourself, in Your own likeness, the
form of all things, but out of nothing, a formless unlikeness which should be formed
by Your likeness (having recourse to You the One, after their settled capacity,
according as it has been given to each thing in his kind), and might all be

these directs his attention to that which is said, In the beginning God made
the heaven and the earth, and beholds Wisdom — the Beginning, because It also
speaks unto us. John 8:23 Another likewise directs his attention to the
same words, and by beginning understands the commencement of things created;
and receives it thus — In the beginning He made, as if it were said, He at
first made. And among those who understand In the beginning to mean, that in
Your Wisdom You have created heaven and earth, one believes the matter out of
which the heaven and earth were to be created to be there called heaven and
earth; another, that they are natures already formed and distinct; another, one
formed nature, and that a spiritual, under the name of heaven, the other
formless, of corporeal matter, under the name of earth. But they who under the
name of heaven and earth understand matter as yet formless, out of which were
to be formed heaven and earth, do not themselves understand it in one manner;
but one, that matter out of which the intelligible and the sensible creature
were to be completed; another, that only out of which this sensible corporeal
mass was to come, holding in its vast bosom these visible and prepared natures.
Nor are they who believe that the creatures already set in order and arranged
are in this place called heaven and earth of one accord; but the one, both the
invisible and visible; the other, the visible only, in which we admire the
luminous heaven and darksome earth, and the things that are therein.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

otherwise understand, In the beginning He made, than if it were said, At first
He made, can only truly understand heaven and earth of the matter of heaven and
earth, namely, of the universal, that is, intelligible and corporeal creation.
For if he would have it of the universe. as already formed, it might rightly be
asked of him: If at first God made this, what made He afterwards? And after the
universe he will find nothing; thereupon must he, though unwilling, hear, How
is this first, if there is nothing afterwards? But when he says that God made
matter first formless, then formed, he is not absurd if he be but able to
discern what precedes by eternity, what by time, what by choice, what by
origin. By eternity, as God is before all things; by time, as the flower is
before the fruit; by choice, as the fruit is before the flower; by origin, as
sound is before the tune. Of these four, the first and last which I have
referred to are with much difficulty understood; the two middle very easily.
For an uncommon and too lofty vision it is to behold, O Lord, Your Eternity,
immutably making things mutable, and thereby before them. Who is so acute of
mind as to be able without great labour to discover how the sound is prior to
the tune, because a tune is a formed sound; and a thing not formed may exist,
but that which exists not cannot be formed? So is the matter prior to that
which is made from it; not prior because it makes it, since itself is rather
made, nor is it prior by an interval of time. For we do not as to time first
utter formless sounds without singing, and then adapt or fashion them into the
form of a song, just as wood or silver from which a chest or vessel is made.
Because such materials do by time also precede the forms of the things which
are made from them; but in singing this is not so. For when it is sung, its
sound is heard at the same time; seeing there is not first a formless sound,
which is afterwards formed into a song. For as soon as it shall have first
sounded it passes away; nor can you find anything of it, which being recalled
you can by art compose. And, therefore, the song is absorbed in its own sound,
which sound of it is its matter. Because this same is formed that it may be a
tune; and therefore, as I was saying, the matter of the sound is prior to the
form of the tune, not before through any power of making it a tune; for neither
is a sound the composer of the tune, but is sent forth from the body and is
subjected to the soul of the singer, that from it he may form a tune. Nor is it
first in time, for it is given forth together with the tune; nor first in
choice, for a sound is not better than a tune, since a tune is not merely a
sound, but a beautiful sound. But it is first in origin, because the tune is
not formed that it may become a sound, but the sound is formed that it may
become a tune. By this example, let him who is able understand that the matter
of things was first made, and called heaven and earth, because out of it heaven
and earth were made. Not that it was made first in time, because the forms of
things give rise to time, but that was formless; but now, in time, it is
perceived together with its form. Nor yet can anything be related concerning
that matter, unless as if it were prior in time, while it is considered last (because
things formed are assuredly superior to things formless), and is preceded by
the Eternity of the Creator, so that there might be out of nothing that from
which something might be made.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

nothing, nor though of You was equal to You, might yet be, since it could be
made of You. For what did heaven and earth, which You made in the beginning,
deserve of You? Let those spiritual and corporeal natures, which Thou in Your
wisdom made, declare what they deserve of You to depend thereon — even the
inchoate and formless, each in its own kind, either spiritual or corporeal,
going into excess, and into remote unlikeness unto You (the spiritual, though
formless, more excellent than if it were a formed body; and the corporeal,
though formless, more excellent than if it were altogether nothing), and thus
they as formless would depend upon Your Word, unless by the same Word they were
recalled to Your Unity, and endued with form, and from You, the one sovereign
Good, were all made very good. How have they deserved of You, that they should

since it were not even this had Thou not made it; and therefore since it was
not, it could not deserve of You that it should be made? Or how could the
inchoate spiritual creature deserve of You, that even it should flow darksomely
like the deep — unlike You, had it not been by the same Word turned to that by
Whom it was created, and by Him so enlightened become light, although not
equally, yet conformably to that Form which is equal unto You? For as to a
body, to be is not all one with being beautiful, for then it could not be
deformed; so also to a created spirit, to live is not all one with living
wisely, for then it would be wise unchangeably. But it is good for it always to
hold fast unto You, lest, in turning from You, it lose that light which it has
obtained in turning to You, and relapse into a light resembling the darksome
deep. For even we ourselves, who in respect of the soul are a spiritual
creature, having turned away from You, our light, were in that life sometimes
darkness; Ephesians 5:8 and do labour amidst the remains of our darkness,

not deserved of You that it should be such a life as could be enlightened, so
neither, when it already was, has it deserved of You that it should be enlightened.
For neither could its formlessness be pleasing unto You, unless it became light
— not by merely existing, but by beholding the illuminating light, and cleaving
unto it; so also, that it lives, and lives happily, it owes to nothing
whatsoever but to Your grace; being converted by means of a better change unto
that which can be changed neither into better nor into worse; the which Thou

You, being perfect, their imperfection is displeasing, and therefore were they
perfected by You, and were pleasing unto You; but not as if You were imperfect,
and were to be perfected in their perfection. For Your good Spirit was borne

that it should be spoken of Him that He was borne over, and this could not be
said, unless that were first mentioned over which Your Spirit may be understood
to have been borne? For neither was He borne over the Father, nor the Son, nor
could it rightly be said that He was borne over if He were borne over nothing.
That, therefore, was first to be spoken of over which He might be borne; and

are far other than the Trinity; but I speak of things in which they may
exercise and prove themselves, and feel how far other they be. But the three

Will; I Am Knowing and Willing; and I Know myself to Be and to Will; and I Will
to Be and to Know. In these three, therefore, let him who can see how
inseparable a life there is — even one life, one mind, and one essence;
finally, how inseparable is the distinction, and yet a distinction. Surely a

when he discovers and can say anything of these, let him not then think that he
has discovered that which is above these Unchangeable, which Is unchangeably, and
Knows unchangeably, and Wills unchangeably. And whether on account of these
three there is also, where they are, a Trinity; or whether these three be in
Each, so that the three belong to Each; or whether both ways at once,
wondrously, simply, and vet diversely, in Itself a limit unto Itself, yet
illimitable; whereby It is, and is known unto Itself, and suffices to Itself,

blessing, sending the labourers of Your goodness into Your harvest,
Matthew 9:38 in the sowing of which others have laboured, sending also
into another field, whose harvest shall be in the end. Matthew 13:39 Thus
Thou grantest the prayers of him that asks, and blessest the years of the just;

is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, as if the greater light, on account
of those who are delighted with the light of manifest truth, as in the
beginning of the day; but to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit,
as if the lesser light; to another faith; to another the gift of healing; to
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning
of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues. And all these as stars. For
all these works the one and self-same Spirit, dividing to every man his own as
He wills; 1 Corinthians 12:8-11 and making stars appear manifestly,
to profit withal. 1 Corinthians 12:7 But the word of knowledge,
wherein are contained all sacraments, which are varied in their periods like
the moon, and the other conceptions of gifts, which are successively reckoned
up as stars, inasmuch as they come short of that splendour of wisdom in which
the fore-mentioned day rejoices, are only for the beginning of the night. For
they are necessary to such as he Your most prudent servant could not speak unto
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal 1 Corinthians 3:1 — even he who
speaks wisdom among those that are perfect. 1 Corinthians 2:6 But the
natural man, as a babe in Christ — and a drinker of milk — until he be
strengthened for solid meat, and his eye be enabled to look upon the Sun, let
him not dwell in his own deserted night, but let him be contented with the
light of the moon and the stars. Thou reasonest these things with us, our

bearing fruit; and come let us reason together, says the Lord, Isaiah 1:l8
that there may be lights in the firmament of heaven, and that they may shine
upon the earth. Genesis 1:15 That rich man asked of the good Master what
he should do to attain eternal life. Matthew 19:16 Let the good Master,
whom he thought a man, and nothing more, tell him (but He is good because He is
God) — let Him tell him, that if he would enter into life he must keep the
commandments; let him banish from himself the bitterness of malice and
wickedness; 1 Corinthians 5:8 let him not kill, nor commit adultery,
nor steal, nor bear false witness; that the dry land may appear, and bud forth

Matthew 19:16-19 All these, says he, have I kept. Whence, then, are there
so many thorns, if the earth be fruitful? Go, root up the woody thicket of
avarice; sell that you have, and be filled with fruit by giving to the poor,

beautiful feet, Isaiah 52:7 and shine in the firmament, Daniel 12:3
that the heavens may declare His glory, dividing between the light of the

not despised ones. Shine over all the earth, and let the day, lightened by the
sun, utter unto day the word of wisdom; and let night, shining by the moon,
announce unto night the word of knowledge. The moon and the stars shine for the
night, but the night obscures them not, since they illumine it in its degree.
For behold God (as it were) saying, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven. There came suddenly a sound from heaven, as it had been the rushing of
a mighty wind, and there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat
upon each of them. Acts 2:3 And there were made lights in the firmament of

the voices of Your messengers flying above the earth, near to the firmament of

these things that are in the firmament of heaven, and the corporeal works in

whereof the knowledge is solid and defined, without increase by generation, as
it were lights of wisdom and knowledge, yet of these self-same things the
material operations are many and varied; and one thing in growing from another
is multiplied by Your blessing, O God, who hast refreshed the fastidiousness of
mortal senses; so that in the knowledge of our mind, one thing may, through the
motions of the body, be in many ways set out and expressed. These sacraments
have the waters brought forth; but in Your Word. The wants of the people
estranged from the eternity of Your truth have produced them, but in Your

Word, not the depth of the sea, but the earth parted from the bitterness of the

Genesis 1:20 but the living soul itself. Genesis 2:7 For now has it
no longer need of baptism, as the heathen have, and as itself had when it was
covered with the waters — for no other entrance is there into the kingdom of
heaven, John 3:5 since You have appointed that this should be the entrance
— nor does it seek great works of miracles by which to cause faith; for it is
not such that, unless it shall have seen signs and wonders, it will not
believe, John 4:48 when now the faithful earth is separated from the
waters of the sea, rendered bitter by infidelity; and tongues are for a sign,
not to those that believe, but to those that believe not. 1 Corinthians 14:22
Nor then does the earth, which You have founded above the waters, stand in need
of that flying kind which at Your word the waters brought forth. Send Your word
forth into it by Your messengers. For we relate their works, but it is Thou who
work in them, that in it they may work out a living soul. The earth brings it
forth, because the earth is the cause that they work these things in the soul;
as the sea has been the cause that they wrought upon the moving creatures that
have life, and the fowls that fly under the firmament of heaven, of which the
earth has now no need; although it feeds on the fish which was taken out of the
deep, upon that table which You have prepared in the presence of those that
believe. For therefore He was raised from the deep, that He might feed the dry
land; and the fowl, though bred in the sea, is yet multiplied upon the earth.
For of the first preachings of the Evangelists, the infidelity of men was the
prominent cause; but the faithful also are exhorted, and are manifoldly blessed
by them day by day. But the living soul takes its origin from the earth, for it
is not profitable, unless to those already among the faithful, to restrain
themselves from the love of this world, that so their soul may live unto You,
which was dead while living in pleasures, 1 Timothy 5:6 — in
death-bearing pleasures, O Lord, for You are the vital delight of the pure
heart.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Your ministers work upon the earth — not as in the waters of infidelity, by
announcing and speaking by miracles, and sacraments, and mystic words; in which
ignorance, the mother of admiration, may be intent upon them, in fear of those
hidden signs. For such is the entrance unto the faith for the sons of Adam
forgetful of You, while they hide themselves from Your face, Genesis 3:8
and become a darksome deep. But let Your ministers work even as on the dry
land, separated from the whirlpools of the great deep; and let them be an
example unto the faithful, by living before them, and by stimulating them to
imitation. For thus do men hear not with an intent to hear merely, but to act
also. Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live, that the earth may bring forth
the living soul. Be not conformed to this world. Romans 12:2 Restrain
yourselves from it; the soul lives by avoiding those things which it dies by
affecting. Restrain yourselves from the unbridled wildness of pride, from the
indolent voluptuousness of luxury, and from the false name of knowledge; so
that wild beasts may be tamed, the cattle subdued, and serpents harmless. For
these are the motions of the mind in allegory; that is to say, the haughtiness

imitating the followers of Your Christ. 1 Corinthians 11:1 For this
is after his kind; because a man is stimulated to emulation by his friend. Be,
says he, as I am, for I am as you are. Galatians 4:12 Thus in the living

our God, our Creator, when our affections have been restrained from the love of

living well; and Your word which Thou spoke by Your apostle is made good in us,
Be not conformed to this world; next also follows that which You presently
subjoined, saying, But be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
Romans 12:2 — not now after your kind, as if following your neighbour who
went before you, nor as if living after the example of a better man (for You
have not said, Let man be made after his kind, but, Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness), Genesis 1:26 that we may prove what Your will
is. For to this purpose said that dispenser of Yours — begetting children by
the gospel, 1 Corinthians 4:15 — that he might not always have them
babes, whom he would feed on milk, and cherish as a nurse;
1 Thessalonians 2:7 be transformed, says He, by the renewing of your
mind, that he may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of
God. Romans 12:2 Therefore You say not, Let man be made, but, Let us make
man. Nor sayest Thou, after his kind, but, after our image and likeness.
Because, being renewed in his mind, and beholding and apprehending Your truth, man
needs not man as his director Jeremiah 31:34 that he may imitate his kind;
but by Your direction proves what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect
will of Yours. And Thou teachest him, now made capable, to perceive the Trinity
of the Unity, and the Unity of the Trinity. And therefore this being said in
the plural, Let us make man, it is yet subjoined in the singular, and God made
man; and this being said in the plural, after our likeness, is subjoined in the
singular, after the image of God. Genesis 1:27 Thus is man renewed in the
knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created him; Colossians 3:10

does by the discernment of his mind, whereby he perceives the things of the
Spirit of God; 1 Corinthians 2:14 whereas, otherwise, man being
placed in honour, had no understanding, and is compared unto the brute beasts,
and has become like them. In Your Church, therefore, O our God, according to
Your grace which You have accorded unto it, since we are Your workmanship
created in good works, Ephesians 2:10 there are not only those who are
spiritually set over, but those also who are spiritually subjected to those
placed over them; for in this manner have You made man, male and female,
Genesis 1:27 in Your grace spiritual, where, according to the sex of body,
there is not male and female, because neither Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free.
Galatians 3:28 Spiritual persons, therefore, whether those that are set
over, or those who obey, judge spiritually; not of that spiritual knowledge
which shines in the firmament, for they ought not to judge as to an authority
so sublime, nor does it behoove them to judge of Your Book itself, although
there be something that is not clear therein; because we submit our
understanding unto it, and esteem as certain that even that which is shut up
from our sight is rightly and truly spoken. For thus man, although now
spiritual and renewed in the knowledge of God after His image that created him,
ought yet to be the doer of the law, not the judge. James 4:11 Neither
does he judge of that distinction of spiritual and carnal men, who are known to
Your eyes, O our God, and have not as yet made themselves manifest unto us by
works, that by their fruits we may know them; Matthew 8:20 but Thou, O
Lord, dost already know them, and You have divided and hast called them in
secret, before the firmament was made. Nor does that man, though spiritual,
judge the restless people of this world; for what has he to do to judge them
that are without, 1 Corinthians 5:12 knowing not which of them may
afterwards come into the sweetness of Your grace, and which continue in the
perpetual bitterness of impiety?</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

You have made after Your own image, received not dominion over the lights of
heaven, nor over the hidden heaven itself, nor over the day and the night, which
You called before the foundation of the heaven, nor over the gathering together
of the waters, which is the sea; but he received dominion over the fishes of
the sea, and the fowls of the air, and over all cattle, and over all the earth,
and over all creeping things which creep upon the earth. For He judges and
approves what He finds right, but disapproves what He finds amiss, whether in
the celebration of those sacraments by which are initiated those whom Your
mercy searches out in many waters; or in that in which the Fish Itself is
exhibited, which, being raised from the deep, the devout earth feeds upon; or
in the signs and expressions of words, subject to the authority of Your Book —
such signs as burst forth and sound from the mouth, as it were flying under the
firmament, by interpreting, expounding, discoursing, disputing, blessing,
calling upon You, so that the people may answer, <span>Amen</span>. The vocal pronunciation of all which words is caused by
the deep of this world, and the blindness of the flesh, by which thoughts
cannot be seen, so that it is necessary to speak aloud in the ears; thus,
although flying fowls be multiplied upon the earth, yet they derive their
beginning from the waters. The spiritual man judges also by approving what is
right and reproving what he finds amiss in the works and morals of the
faithful, in their alms, as if in the earth bringing forth fruit; and he judges
of the living soul, rendered living by softened affections, in chastity, in
fastings, in pious thoughts; and of those things which are perceived through
the senses of the body. For it is now said, that he should judge concerning
those things in which he has also the power of correction.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth; Genesis 1:28 in this dost
Thou not make a sign unto us that we may understand something? Why have You not
also blessed the light, which You called day, nor the firmament of heaven, nor
the lights, nor the stars, nor the earth, nor the sea? I might say, O our God,
that Thou, who hast created us after Your Image — I might say, that You have
willed to bestow this gift of blessing especially upon man, had Thou not in
like manner blessed the fishes and the whales, that they should be fruitful and
multiply, and replenish the waters of the sea, and that the fowls should be
multiplied upon the earth. Likewise might I say, that this blessing belonged
properly unto such creatures as are propagated from their own kind, if I had
found it in the shrubs, and the fruit trees, and beasts of the earth. But now
is it not said either unto the herbs, or trees, or beasts, or serpents, Be
fruitful and multiply; since all these also, as well as fishes, and fowls, and
men, do by propagation increase and preserve their kind.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

say, O Thou Truth, my Light —that it was idly and vainly said? Not so, O Father
of piety; far be it from a minister of Your word to say this. But if I
understand not what Thou meanest by that phrase, let my betters — that is,
those more intelligent than I— use it better, in proportion as Thou, O my God,
hast given to each to understand. But let my confession be also pleasing before
Your eyes, in which I confess to You that I believe, O Lord, that You have not
thus spoken in vain; nor will I be silent as to what this lesson suggests to
me. For it is true, nor do I see what should prevent me from thus understanding
the figurative sayings of Your books. For I know a thing may be manifoldly
signified by bodily expression which is understood in one manner by the mind;
and that that may be manifoldly understood in the mind which is in one manner
signified by bodily expression. Behold, the single love of God and of our
neighbour, by what manifold sacraments and innumerable languages, and in each
several language in how innumerable modes of speaking, it is bodily expressed. Thus
do the young of the waters increase and multiply. Observe again, whosoever you
are who readest; behold what Scripture delivers, and the voice pronounces in
one only way, In the beginning God created heaven and earth; is it not
manifoldly understood, not by any deceit of error, but by various kinds of true
senses? Thus are the offspring of men fruitful and do multiply.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">37. If, therefore, we
conceive of the natures of things, not allegorically, but properly, then does
the phrase, be fruitful and multiply, correspond to all things which are
begotten of seed. But if we treat those words as taken figuratively (the which
I rather suppose the Scripture intended, which does not, verily, superfluously
attribute this benediction to the offspring of marine animals and man only),
then do we find that multitude belongs also to creatures both spiritual and
corporeal, as in heaven and in earth; and to souls both righteous and
unrighteous, as in light and darkness; and to holy authors, through whom the
law has been furnished unto us, as in the firmament which has been firmly
placed between waters and waters; and to the society of people yet endued with
bitterness, as in the sea; and to the desire of holy souls, as in the dry land;
and to works of mercy pertaining to this present life, as in the seed-bearing
herbs and fruit-bearing trees; and to spiritual gifts shining forth for
edification, as in the lights of heaven; and to affections formed unto
temperance, as in the living soul. In all these cases we meet with multitudes,
abundance, and increase; but what shall thus be fruitful and multiply, that one
thing may be expressed in many ways, and one expression understood in many
ways, we discover not, unless in signs corporeally expressed, and in things
mentally conceived. We understand the signs corporeally pronounced as the
generations of the waters, necessarily occasioned by carnal depth; but things
mentally conceived we understand as human generations, on account of the
fruitfulness of reason. And therefore do we believe that to each kind of these
it has been said by You, O Lord, Be fruitful and multiply. For in this blessing
I acknowledge that power and faculty has been granted unto us, by You, both to
express in many ways what we understand but in one, and to understand in many
ways what we read as obscurely delivered but in one. Thus are the waters of the
sea replenished, which are not moved but by various significations; thus even
with the human offspring is the earth also replenished, the dryness whereof
appears in its desire, and reason rules over it.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

do I believe that I can speak the truth, since You are the Truth, but every man

John 8:44 therefore that I may speak the truth, I will speak of Yours.
Behold, You have given unto us for food every herb bearing seed, which is upon
the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree
yielding seed. Genesis 1:29 Nor to us only, but to all the fowls of the
air, and to the beasts of the earth, and to all creeping things; but unto the
fishes, and great whales, You have not given these things. Now we were saying,
that by these fruits of the earth works of mercy were signified and figured in
an allegory, the which are provided for the necessities of this life out of the
fruitful earth. Such an earth was the godly Onesiphorus, unto whose house You
gave mercy, because he frequently refreshed Your Paul, and was not ashamed of
his chain. 2 Timothy 1:16 This did also the brethren, and such fruit
did they bear, who out of Macedonia supplied what was wanting unto him.
2 Corinthians 11:9 But how does he grieve for certain trees, which
did not afford him the fruit due unto him, when he says, At my first answer no
man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid
to their charge. 2 Timothy 4:16 For these fruits are due to those who
minister spiritual doctrine, through their understanding of the divine
mysteries; and they are due to them as men. They are due to them, too, as to
the living soul, supplying itself as an example in all continency; and due unto
them likewise as flying creatures, for their blessings which are multiplied
upon the earth, since their sound went out into all lands. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again,
wherein you were also careful, but it had become wearisome unto you. These
Philippians, then, by protracted wearisomeness, had become enfeebled, and as it
were dried up, as to bringing forth this fruit of a good work; and he rejoices
for them, because they flourished again, not for himself, because they
ministered to his wants. Therefore, adds he, not that I speak in respect of
want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I
know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound everywhere and in all
things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to

fowls, speaking mysteries — for to such creatures is this food due — what is
that which feeds you? Joy. Let us hear what follows. Notwithstanding, says he,
you have well done that you did communicate with My affliction.
Philippians 4:14 Hereat does he rejoice, hereon does he feed; because they
have well done, not because his strait was relieved, who says unto you, You
have enlarged me when I was in distress; because he knew both to abound and to
suffer need, in You Who strengthenest him. For, says he, you Philippians know
also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.
For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity.
Philippians 4:15-16 Unto these good works he now rejoices that they have
returned; and is made glad that they flourished again, as when a fruitful field
recovers its greenness.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

his own necessities that he said, You have sent unto my necessity? Rejoices he
for that? Verily not for that. But whence know we this? Because he himself
continues, Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit. From You, O my God,
have I learned to distinguish between a gift and fruit. A gift is the thing
itself which he gives who bestows these necessaries, as money, food, drink,
clothing, shelter, aid; but the fruit is the good and right will of the giver.
For the good Master says not only, He that receives a prophet, but adds, in the
name of a prophet. Nor says He only, He that receives a righteous man, but
adds, in the name of a righteous man. So, verily, the former shall receive the
reward of a prophet, the latter that of a righteous man. Nor says He only,
Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold
water, but adds, in the name of a disciple and so concludes, Verily I say unto
you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. Matthew 10:41-42 The gift is to
receive a prophet, to receive a righteous man, to hand a cup of cold water to a
disciple; but the fruit is to do this in the name of a prophet, in the name of
a righteous man, in the name of a disciple. With fruit was Elijah fed by the
widow, who knew that she fed a man of God, and on this account fed him; but by
the raven was he fed with a gift. Nor was the inner man of Elijah fed, but the
outer only, which might also from want of such food have perished.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Is not this Your Scripture true, since You are true, and being Truth hast set
it forth? Why, then, dost Thou say unto me that in your seeing there are no
times, while this Your Scripture tells me that what You made each day, Thou saw
to be good; and when I counted them I found how often? Unto these things Thou
repliest unto me, for You are my God, and with strong voice tellest unto Your

they say You neither made them nor compacted them — such as all flesh and all
very minute creatures, and whatsoever holds the earth by its roots; but that a
mind hostile unto You and another nature not created by You, and in everywise
contrary unto You, did, in these lower places of the world, beget and frame
these things. Infatuated are they who speak thus, since they see not Your works
through Your Spirit, nor recognise You in them.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

That It Was Good But Through the Spirit of God Which is in Us.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">46. But as for those who
through Your Spirit see these things, You see in them. When therefore, they see
that these things are good, You see that they are good; and whatsoever things
for Your sake are pleasing, You are pleased in them; and those things which
through Your Spirit are pleasing unto us, are pleasing unto You in us. For what
man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even
so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we, says he, have
received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we
might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 1 Corinthians 2:12
And I am reminded to say, Truly, 'the things of God knows no man, but the
Spirit of God;' how, then, do we also know 'what things are given us by God?'?
It is answered unto me, Because the things which we know by His Spirit, even
these 'knows no man, but the Spirit of God.' For, as it is rightly said to
those who were to speak by the Spirit of God, 'It is not you that speak,'
Matthew 10:20 so is it rightly said to them who know by the Spirit of God,
'It is not you that know.' None the less, then, is it rightly said to those
that see by the Spirit of God, 'It is not you that see;' so whatever they see
by the Spirit of God that it is good, it is not they, but God who 'sees that it
is good.' It is one thing, then, for a man to suppose that to be bad which is
good, as the fore-named do; another, that what is good a man should see to be
good (as Your creatures are pleasing unto many, because they are good, whom,
however, Thou pleasest not in them when they wish to enjoy them rather than
enjoy You); and another, that when a man sees a thing to be good, God should in
him see that it is good — that in truth He may be loved in that which He made,
who cannot be loved unless by the Holy Ghost, which He has given. Because the
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us; Romans 5:5 by whom we see that whatsoever in any degree is, is good.
Because it is from Him who Is not in any degree, but He Is that He Is.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Lord. We behold the heaven and the earth, whether the corporeal part, superior
and inferior, or the spiritual and corporeal creature; and in the embellishment
of these parts, whereof the universal mass of the world or the universal
creation consists, we see light made, and divided from the darkness. We see the
firmament of heaven, whether the primary body of the world between the
spiritual upper waters and the corporeal lower waters, or — because this also
is called heaven — this expanse of air, through which wander the fowls of
heaven, between the waters which are in vapours borne above them, and which in
clear nights drop down in dew, and those which being heavy flow along the
earth. We behold the waters gathered together through the plains of the sea;
and the dry land both void and formed, so as to be visible and compact, and the
matter of herbs and trees. We behold the lights shining from above — the sun to
serve the day, the moon and the stars to cheer the night; and that by all
these, times should be marked and noted. We behold on every side a humid
element, fruitful with fishes, beasts, and birds; because the density of the
air, which bears up the flights of birds, is increased by the exhalation of the
waters. We behold the face of the earth furnished with terrestrial creatures,
and man, created after Your image and likeness, in that very image and likeness
of You (that is, the power of reason and understanding) on account of which he
was set over all irrational creatures. And as in his soul there is one power
which rules by directing, another made subject that it might obey, so also for
the man was corporeally made a woman, who, in the mind of her rational
understanding should also have a like nature, in the sex, however, of her body
should be in like manner subject to the sex of her husband, as the appetite of
action is subjected by reason of the mind, to conceive the skill of acting
rightly. These things we behold, and they are severally good, and all very
good.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

You, not of You, nor of any matter not Yours, or which was created before, but
of concreted matter (that is, matter at the same time created by You), because
without any interval of time You formed its formlessness. For since the matter
of heaven and earth is one thing, and the form of heaven and earth another, You
have made the matter indeed of almost nothing, but the form of the world You

description of things in such an order. And we have seen that things severally
are good, and all things very good, Genesis 1:31 in Your Word, in Your Only-Begotten,
both heaven and earth, the Head and the body of the Church, in Your
predestination before all times, without morning and evening. But when Thou
began to execute in time the things predestinated, that You might make manifest
things hidden, and adjust our disorders (for our sins were over us, and we had
sunk into profound darkness away from you, and Your good Spirit was borne over
us to help us in due season), Thou both justified the ungodly, Romans 4:5
and divided them from the wicked; and made firm the authority of Your Book
between those above, who would be docile unto You, and those under, who would
be subject unto them; and You collected the society of unbelievers into one
conspiracy, in order that the zeal of the faithful might appear, and that they
might bring forth works of mercy unto You, even distributing unto the poor
earthly riches, to obtain heavenly. And after this You kindled certain lights
in the firmament, Your holy ones, having the word of life, and shining with an
eminent authority preferred by spiritual gifts; and then again, for the
instruction of the unbelieving Gentiles, did You out of corporeal matter
produce the sacraments and visible miracles, and sounds of words according to
the firmament of Your Book, by which the faithful should be blessed. Next You
formed the living soul of the faithful, through affections ordered by the
vigour of continency; and afterwards, the mind subjected to You alone, and
needing to imitate no human authority, You renewed after Your image and likeness;
and subjected its rational action to the excellency of the understanding, as
the woman to the man; and to all Your ministries, necessary for the perfecting
of the faithful in this life, Thou willed that, for their temporal uses, good
things, fruitful in the future time, should be given by the same faithful. We
behold all these things, and they are very good, because Thou dost see them in

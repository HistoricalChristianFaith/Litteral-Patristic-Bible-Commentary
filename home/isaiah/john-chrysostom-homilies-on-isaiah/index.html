Isaiah. - That the saints and the prophets are animated by a great love towards
the people.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The excellent merit of
this prophet is seen very well in his works, but what makes him see no less
perfectly is the testimony of the one who, more than any other, was able to
appreciate his qualities. I mean St. Paul, whose Holy Spirit dictated the
words. Isaiah's frank language, his thought always free, his high sentiments,
the clarity of his prophecies on Christ, all his qualities, the Apostle shows
them by one word, saying, "Isaiah is not afraid to say . I was found by
those who did not seek me, I showed myself to those who did not ask me. His
compassion for the ills of his brethren is great too. he not only rose up
against the madness of the people, he did not only, in a free language and with
a high thought, announced to the Jews the punishments that would punish them,
but when what he had predicted happened he suffers, he is tormented no less
than those whom misfortune oppresses, and he moans more painfully than those
unfortunate ones. This, indeed, is what almost all the prophets and saints have
done: their affection for those whom they were charged to lead surpassed the
tenderness of the fathers for their children; nature is less strong than their
charity. He is not, no, there is no father who is inflamed with love for his
children like those for the people they ruled: for they were willing to die,
moaning, lamenting, sharing their captivity and their misfortunes, doing and
(338) suffering all, to put an end to the anger of heaven and the misfortunes
they were experiencing. There is nothing that makes us more able to command
than to have a soul full of wisdom and mercy. So the great Moses was placed by
God at the head of the Jewish people only after having manifested by his
actions how much he loved this people, and later he said to him: "If you
forgive them their fault, forgive them; otherwise, erase me also from the book
you wrote. And Isaiah himself, seeing the Jews perish, exclaims: "Let me
go, I will shed bitter tears; do not trouble yourself to console me for the
ruin of the daughter of my people. Jeremy uttered long moans when the city was
overthrown. Ezekiel went off with the Jews, seeing it as less painful to live
in a foreign land than in his own country, and finding that the greatest
alleviation of his troubles was to be with the unfortunate and direct their
affairs. And Daniel for their return remained without food for twenty days and
more and showed all his love for them by begging God to deliver them from this
captivity. This is in a word that all saints shine. For example, when David
sees the anger of the sky melt on the people, it is on himself that he wants to
call this plague, saying: "It is I pastor who sinned, it is I pastor who
did evil, and these, who are my flock, what have they done? May your hand dwell
on me and on my father's house. And Abraham, far from danger, having no fear of
sharing the punishment of the Sodomites, began, as if he had been in the midst
of danger, to invoke and supplicate God, and he would not have ceased to employ
and actions and words to avert this terrible conflagration, if God, after
having dismissed him, had finally left. The saints of the New Testament showed
even more virtue, because they had received more graces and were called to
longer combats. It is for this reason that Peter, hearing Christ say that it is
very difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, was anxious, and trembled
and addressed this question: "Who can be saved? "? And yet, as far as
he was concerned, he had to be full of confidence. It was because these saints
considered their own interest less than they cared for the whole earth. And St.
Paul, in the whole course of his epistles, shows us the same concern, he who in
the vision of Christ preferred the salvation of men: "To die and to be
with Jesus Christ is the best, but to remain in my flesh is more necessary
because of you. It is this same virtue which the Prophet shows when he exposes
the revelations of God so frankly, when he addresses his reproaches to sinners,
when, in frequent circumstances, and by long speeches, he tries to appease God
irritated against the Jews: what we can see especially at the end of the
prophecy. But finally let us approach the beginning of the prophecy.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

prophecy either because he had before him many future events, and so Micah saw
the scattering of the people, Ezekiel the captivity and prevarication of those
who worshiped the sun and Thamuze; or because the things that the prophets
heard coming from God, they were no less sure than the vision itself and
produced an equal certainty, which could not take place outside the divine
intervention. They heard otherwise than the rest of men, for Isaiah said,
"He has added an ear to me to hear. (Isaiah, L, 4.) By calling his
prophecy "vision," he makes his story more credible, he excites the
listener's attention, and makes him think of the author of the vision. All
those who bring us oracles from God are above all careful to establish this
point, that they say nothing that comes from their own funds, but that their
words are only divine revelations, that writings come down from the sky. So
David said, "My tongue is the pen of a writer who writes quickly. So do
not think that the letters come from the pen, but from the hand that holds it,
that is to say, not from the language of David, but from the grace that move
it. Another prophet who wanted to show the same thing said, "I was a
goatherd, snatching sycamores. (Amos, VII, 14.) So that we must not judge these
words according to the rules of human wisdom. And this very word was not enough
for him, he added: "The Spirit of the Lord filled me with strength,
judgment, and power. For grace has made them not only wise, but strong not
according to the body, but according to the soul. As they had to address a
daring and impudent people, altered from the blood of the prophets, delighted
in massacring the saints, they certainly needed a lot of strength not to fear
his anger. Therefore the Lord said to Jeremiah, "I have placed you as
naked iron cotton sea and as a wall of brass; And to Ezekiel "You live in
the midst of scorpions, do not fear in front of them and do not fear them. And
when Moses was sent, it is not only in my opinion because he feared Pharaoh
that he wanted to refuse his mission, but because he feared the Jewish people.
This is why, in talking with God, without even thinking of the king, he
inquires with great care what he will have to say to those who will not
recognize him as God's envoy, and it was for the to convince that he received
the power of miracles; and it was with reason. For if only one of them who had
even been saved by him frightened him to the point of flight, what should he
not have felt in thinking of all this turbulent people? So besides the Spirit
of wisdom, he also received the Spirit of strength, as another prophet said of
himself. "The Spirit of the Lord filled me with strength, judgment, and
power (Micah III, 8); And another "The word of God was heard by Jeremiah
son of Chelcias (Jeremiah 1: 1); And yet another: "Inspiration against
Nineveh: book of Nahum's vision of Elcesai. (Nahum.) The latter, while using
another term, utters the same thing as the first: he calls inspired those whose
Spirit has seized. It is because in speaking thus they were dominated by the
Holy Spirit that he called the operation of grace. It is for the same reason
that St. Paul places at the head of all his epistles his title of an apostle;
what the prophets did by using the words vision, speech, inspiration, speech;
he does so by using the word apostle. If he who says vision, word of God,
announces nothing that comes from him, he who is called an apostle, that is,
sent, neither teaches a doctrine of his own, but the doctrine of the One who
sent him. The function of an apostle consists precisely in giving nothing that
comes from oneself. This is why Christ says, "Call no one your master on
the earth, only one is your Master, and he is in heaven (Matt XXIII, 10); He
shows us that what we teach has its beginning and root in our heavenly Master,
although the ministers of the word are men. "What does Isaiah live? How do
the prophets perceive what they see, it is not for us to say: our speech is
powerless to explain the mode of their vision; he alone knows him who has
experienced it. If (340) our nature, whether it acts, or remains passive, has
secrets that no one can account for, how could we explain how to operate the
Holy Spirit? If, however, it is necessary, by obscure images, to try to show it
not in a clear light, but as in enigmas, it seems to me that the prophets are
experiencing something analogous to what is done in pure water that comes to
illuminate the rays. of the sun that their souls purified first by their own
virtues, and also made apt to reflect the divine light, then receive the grace
of the Holy Spirit, and with it the knowledge of the future.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

places separately? Because punishments must be distinct and inflicted in
different times; God, by regulating things thus, had shown his wisdom; he did
not want to destroy them all at once, but slowly and gradually so that the
misery of those who would be taken captive would inspire repentance to those
who remained. That if they did not profit from the remedy as they should have,
the car is to these patients and not to the divine Doctor. God has the same
conduct in all circumstances and in all times, and he never punishes at the same
time all those who have committed the same crimes; for otherwise it would have
been a long time since our whole race had disappeared; but he punishes some
here below, and by this he softens to themselves the chastisement of the other
life, while he gives to those who witness to their punishment an admirable
opportunity of conversion; as for those whom neither their own nature nor the
wisdom of this conduct can bring back to good, he reserves them for the
inevitable and terrible day of judgment. "In the reign of Uzziah, and
Joathan, and Achar, and Hezekiah, reigning in Judea. He did well to mention
time, since he thus calls the attention of the studious reader to the history
of past events. The prophecy will be all the more intelligible and clearer: for
knowing the state of things and what was wrong with the Jews, we shall judge
better of the remedies which the prophets have brought. "Listen, heaven,
and you, earth, listen, for it is the Lord who has spoken (2). This beginning
is full of anger; for if he had not been swept away by an indescribable fury,
how would he have left men to address the elements? He does so not only to show
that he is irritated, but also to shame those who should hear him, by showing
them that, honored by reason, they have, however, degraded themselves beneath
the insensible elements. This is, moreover, a customary thing for other
prophets. Thus the Prophet sent to Jeroboam, instead of addressing him whom he
comes to take back, addresses the altar. And Jeremiah dismisses the earth saying,
"Earth, earth, earth, write that this man is proscribed. And another says
again. "Listen, abysses, foundations of the earth; I begot sons. He does
not speak here of a benefit which he has granted to all men, that of existing,
but of a special benefit to the Israelites, that of having made them his
children. Everywhere the Lord begins with benefits; when he created man, he
filled with honor the one who did not yet exist, saying, "Let us make man
in our image and likeness. Under the New Testament he does more: for they are
not men who have done nothing, but men who have committed an infinity of sins,
whom he regenerates in the waters of baptism; here you see the same thing,
since he honors with his adoption men who not only did not do good but who had
fallen into evil, and yet if he honors them before they could to deserve is not
that he deprives them of reward when they have merited; on the contrary, it
grants them greater rewards. "And I raised them. The benefits bestowed in
Egypt, the benefits bestowed in the desert, the benefits bestowed on Palestine,
he recalls all in one word; for it is the custom of God, whose benefits are so
numerous to refrain from reminding them at length and (341) minutely. "And
they despised me. "They have," he says, "transgressed my law,
abandoned my precepts. "The ox knows who he belongs to, and the donkey the
stable of his master." "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Christ says, "The Ninevites will rise to judgment with this generation and
they will condemn it," and in another place: "The queen of the south
will rise to judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came
from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. (Luke, XI, 31-32.)
And Jeremiah said again, "Go to the Isles of Cosim and cast your eyes on
Cedar. Send in to know if these nations will ever change their gods; but my
people have changed their glory, and that will serve them no good. He shows
that the law is not hard, and how little it requires men, that animals deprived
of reason and the stupidest animals observe easily. But, you will say, it is
the nature that operates in them. What nature does in them, the free will can
do it in us. "The ox knows who he belongs to. It is not on the excellence
of his gifts but on the excess of their malice that he bases his accusation. In
the same way that he addressed himself to their elements for confusion, so it
is not to men, but animals and stupid animals that he compares them, and finds them

"Israel did not know me. The crime is aggravated when they are intimate
friends, filled with favors, who, all together, rush into evil. He does not say
Jacob, but "Israel," so that this name which recalls the virtue of
the patriarch inspires his descendants with more confusion. To this one his
virtue was worth the blessing expressed by his name, and these by their malice
reject it. "And my people did not understand me," he said, more
brilliant than the sun. " Misfortune ! sinful nation (4). This is still
the habit of the prophets, of crying over men suffering from incurable evils.
So does Jeremiah in many places; so Christ when he says, "Woe to you,
Corozin! woe to you, Bethsaida! This is another way of teaching: for he whom
reason has not been able to bring back, often tears bring him back.
"People filled with iniquities. This makes the accusation more serious;
they sinned all and even the last excesses. "Nasty race. It is not that he
blames them for their origin, but he shows that since their first age they are
sinners. When John says "Serpents, a race of vipers (Matt 3: 7)," he
does not accuse their nature: for he would not have said to them, "Make
worthy fruits of penance," if they had been wicked. by nature of birth.
Likewise, by saying here "wicked race," the Prophet does not reproach
them for their birth. "Son without law; He does not say
"transgressors," but "without law," which are no better
than if they had never received the law. He thus notes the corruption (1) of
the will. "You have abandoned the Lord and you have angered him. He speaks
thus emphatically, for the name alone of God sufficed to justify the
accusation. Jeremiah makes the same reproach in these terms: "Because they
have moved away from him and have become attached to the" demons. (Bar IV,

him well as the Master of all things. "They turned back (5). Why do you
still hit, you who constantly add to your prevarications? What a sad state when
the same punishments do not make it better! Certainly, it is one of the forms
of benefit that punishment. They will not be able to say that he has granted
them only honors and goods, and that when they have sinned, he has abandoned
them; but by the honors he has attracted them, by the fear of punishments he
has desired to bring them to penance, and in either case they have proved
themselves incorrigible. He used all the treatments, he cut, he burned, and the
disease did not disappear; what shows that the disease is incurable is that it
is rebellious to remedies. "Every head is sick and heart filled with
sadness (6). From the feet to the head there is nothing healthy in him, no
wound, no tumor, no inflamed wound. He then recalls the punishments and
punishments; for this is not a small mark of his love and honor. I hit them
all, he said, I overwhelmed them with pain. If all heads are sick, how is there
no injury or tumor? The wound appears only when the rest of the body is
healthy; but if he is covered with wounds, one will not be able to distinguish
one in particular. That means that the whole body is covered with ulcers, that
there is not a healthy place next to another patient, but that everything is
inflamed, that everything is a tumor. "You can not apply anything
softening. Here is more serious. It is far less unfortunate to be ill than to
be able to undergo treatment, especially when the doctor is so tall. "No
oil, no tapes. It is to speak by emphasis that he continues the metaphor; this
is the merit of this figure. "Your land is deserted (7). These events, he
does not tell them as past, he announces them as future, although he uses the
time of the past. The prophets use it to frighten the listener and to show how
much what they predict is certain. Just as past things can not have not
existed, so the things that the prophets have announced must exist, can not
fail, unless by chance those who are to be punished do not repent. "Your
cities are burned. He did not destroy them entirely, he allowed ruins escaped
from the flames of the barbarians to remain upright, because they would touch
more those who would see them. "Foreigners devour your country before your
eyes, and it is deserted because it has been ravaged by foreign peoples. This
is the height of misfortune for men to be spectators of evils which reach them,
instead of learning them by fame alone. "The daughter of Zion remained
abandoned like a tent in a vineyard and like a hut in a field of cucumbers (8).

especially those of the Holy Scripture, to make more striking what one says.
The Prophet calls Jerusalem daughter of Zion because she is placed at the foot
of this mountain. "Like a tent in a vineyard and like a hut in a field of
cucumbers. The fruit once removed, and the winemakers taken away, what are the
buildings of the city for? "Like a city besieged. This figurative
expression marks their weakness and their abandonment. For, having no one to
come to their aid, they were obliged to remain shut up in the enclosure of
their ramparts, which now made all their security. "And if the Lord of
hosts had not left some of our race, we would have been like Sodom, and we
would have become like Gomorrah." It is a constant habit of the prophets
to say not only what sinners will suffer from evils, but also what they deserve
to suffer so that in the very time of their chastisement they render to God
frequent thanksgiving. what he laughs inflicts on them a punishment far
inferior to their crimes. This is what Isaiah says here, that their sins would
have deserved not the evils he has just recalled, but the complete extinction
of the whole race, as it had happened to Sodom. But the mercy of God did not
permit it, it only sent a punishment much lower than the faults. And since
there is much connection between the Old and New Testaments, St. Paul used the
same means, and with more reason than the prophet. For just as at that time,
without the mercy of God, all would have perished, so in the time of Christ,
without charity, all men perished in a still more frightful manner. "He
has left us some of our race." He speaks of those who were saved from
captivity. "Hear the word of the Lord, princes of Sodom; pay attention to
the law of our God, people of Gomorrah (10). After saying that they were worthy
of Sodom's punishment, he shows that their crimes were no less daring than
those of Sodom, which is why he understands them with one and the same
apostrophe. This is what the Prophet means, otherwise his word would be
irrelevant. By this name of princes of Sodom it is not the inhabitants of this
last city, but the Jews whom he wishes to designate; what follows clearly
indicates this. He speaks of sacrifices, of oblations, of all this legal
worship, of which there was no trace among the Sodomites. These words, the law
of our God, prove that this is the meaning.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"What have I to do
with the multitude of your (343) sacrifices? says the Lord. I have enough burnt
offerings from your rams; the fat of the lambs, the blood of bulls and goats, I
do not want it any more. The whole psalm XLIX resembles these passages; the
terms differ, but the thoughts are the same. For this verse of the psalm,
"He will call heaven from on high and the earth to judge his people,"
looks like this: "Listen, heaven, and you, earth, lend ear, because the
Lord talked; And the rest is not the same. If David said, "I will not
rebuke you for your sacrifices, for your burnt offerings are always before
me." Isaiah said the same, "What am I to do with the multitude of
your sacrifices? says the Lord. David said again, "I will not receive with
pleasure from your house the calves, nor from your flocks the goats." And
Isaiah: "The burnt offerings of the rams, the fat of the lambs, the blood
of the bulls and goats, I do not want any more. As they were continually
reproached with want of virtue, and answered for every justification that they
continually offered sacrifices, these two prophets, or rather all the prophets,
took away their defense. Whence it is evident that these sacrifices were
instituted not for themselves, but to lead men to other works of virtue. But
because they neglected the things necessary to stop at these observances, God
declares that he will no longer accept them. "Not even when you come in my
presence (12). When you come to the temple, he means. "For who has claimed
these things out of your hands? And yet all Leviticus rolls on it and rules
what regards the sacrifices. And in Deuteronomy, as in many other books, there
are here and there a great deal of laws on this subject. How, then, can he say,
"What did these things claim from your hands? This is to teach you that
God had not made this legislation for what it was worth by itself, but to
condescend to the weakness of the Jews. Just as he did not want the woman, once
united to man, to be divorced, and yet allow it to avoid greater evils, to
prevent men from slaughtering their wives, if, while hating them, they were
obliged to keep them at home; so that, to prevent the Israelites from
sacrificing to the demons, he would receive what he did not like, so that what
pleased him was done. This is what the prophet Amos shows us with these words:
"Have you offered me sacrifices and victims during the forty years of the
desert? Jeremiah also says, "This is not what I commanded your fathers.

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. As it is in this way
that the demons were honored, it is to remove from the weak every subject of
scandal that he thus speaks by all the prophets. The demons were angry with
those who did not offer them these sacrifices, and always we are represented to
them asking for fat and smoke and saying: "It is the honor which is attributed
to us (1). God, on the contrary, did not ask in principle these sacrifices, and
when he commanded them, he showed that it was not for himself that he allowed
them, and yet another proof is that he He soon put an end to it, and when it
was offered to him, he did not accept it; in a word, he showed us by every
possible means that this mode of adoration was unworthy of the grandeur of his
worship. So he wants us to say now: I tolerated these things because of you,
but I did not need them. "You will not come to tread my courts. He either
predicts captivity or forbids them to enter his courts because they do not do
so with a right heart. "If you offer me flour, it's useless (13). For
among the commandments, some have reason to be in themselves, others in other
things; for example, to know God, not to kill, not to commit adultery, etc.,
all these commandments are ordained for themselves and for the utility they
contain; On the contrary, to offer sacrifices, to bring incense, to keep the
Sabbath, and all such things, all these commandments were not given simply and
absolutely for the things they prescribed, but for their observation to drive
the Israelites away from the worship of God. demons. But since they kept these
last precepts without reaping the fruits of them, and were none the less
attached to demons, it is with reason that God rejects these observances; for
it is with good reason that a tree is cut down, which bears leaves and
branches, but bears no fruit. Because if the farmer cares for a tree, it is not
for the bark and the wood, but for the fruit he expects. "Your incense is
an abomination to me. Do you see him? He is less pleased with the nature of
what is brought to him than with the dispositions of those who offer. So he
calls the smoke and odor that rose from the sacrifice of Noah a pleasant
fragrance, and here he gives incense the name of abomination. For as I said, he
looks less at the nature of gifts than at the dispositions of those who give.
"Your Neomenies and Sabbaths" (14). Notice that he does not reject
anything that is necessary, but only those rites that Christ descended among us
to make disappear. Thus St. Paul, who spoke vehemently when he fought against
the Jews, recalls not only these things, but others, and says that those who have
no virtue in themselves, needlessly keep these observances. "If you bear
the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and boast in God, and know his will;
and that, instructed by the law, you know how to discern what is useful.
(Romans II, 17, 18). And again: "In truth, circumcision is useful if you
keep the law; but, if you violate it, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
(Ibid, 25.) And he says that if the law has been entrusted to them, their
unbelief will not be punished for it; it is also what David says in these
terms: "God says to the sinner, Why do you speak my righteousness? (Ps.
Xlix, 16.) Seeing them proud to hear the law read, they who were empty of all
good work, St. Paul breaks down their pride by saying: "You who teach
others, you do not instruct So not yourself! You who cry to others not to
steal, you steal! Like David when he says, "If you saw a thief, you ran
with him and made a covenant with the adulterers." (Ps. Xlix, 18.) "I
abominate your great days," Pentecost, it means, the Feast of Tabernacles.
Passover and other holidays. "Your fasts, your rest, your feasts, my soul
hates them. He talks to them like a man would do. "You have become
dependent," an object of disgust, of hate. See his unspeakable
forbearance, to have borne them in spite of their many sins, and to have
avenged himself only when these sinners provoked him by the excess of their
iniquities. "I will not forgive your sins anymore. I will not suffer them
anymore. David says the same thing: "You did these things and I killed myself.
(Ps. XLIX, 21.) "When you extend your hands to me, I will turn my eyes
away from you, and when you multiply your prayers, I will not listen to you
(15). From which it is evident that prayer is useless, however long it may be,
if the one who prays remains in his sins. Nothing is equal to the virtue and
the testimony of the covers. "Your hands are full of blood," that is,
murderous; but instead of loopholes, he said full of blood, to show that they
make iniquity their occupation and always with ardor.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

proof of his gentleness, to see him give the reason for these menaces; for he
says for what causes he regrets the prayer. "Wash yourselves, be pure
(16). How, after saying, "I will not forgive your sins," does he give
this advice and how, after showing them that they are incorrigible, does he ask
them to correct themselves? God, when he threatens, makes despair of salvation,
in order to increase fear, and, far from remaining silent, then, he tries to
restore hope so as to lead to repentance. Everywhere we can see the same
behavior. With regard to the Ninevites, he did the same thing not by words, but
by effects. In his words he had promised nothing good; on the contrary, he had
only allowed the punishment to be seen after the threat; and when these
barbarians had given what they could, his anger soon calmed. This is what David
says in Psalm XLIX; for I said above that this psalm is entirely like this
beginning of Isaiah; and as Isaiah says after calling back the Lord's threats.
"Wash, be clean," so David, after saying, "I will rebuke you, I
will put your iniquities before you," says: "The sacrifice of praise
will honor me, and this is the way in which I will show the salvation of God
(Ps. xlix, 21, 23), "calling to praise the glory given to him by the
covers and the knowledge of divine things.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

that the will is free, since it was in their power to convert. "Learn to
do good (17). So their malice was so great that they did not even know virtue

(Baruch, III, 36, 37); That is, to avenge those who experience injustice, which
requires a lot of care and a watchful soul. That's why he says, "Look.
There are many things that obscure the law, for example, gifts, ignorance,
power, shame, fear, acceptance of persons: so much vigilance is needed,
"Deliver the oppressed." . This bids on the above; he asks not only
that one proposes oneself, but that one executes what is right. "Judge the
fatherless, and do justice to the widow. God takes care that no one is
mistreated, especially among those who, besides these mistreatments, have to
bear another misfortune. The widow and the orphan are very unfortunate; but
when they are mistreated by others, it is like a double shipwreck: "Come
and enter together in discussion; says the Lord. (18) It is remarkable that
everywhere in the prophets, God seeks nothing so much as to avenge the
oppressed. This is so even more so than in Isaiah, for example, in Micah, when
the Jews say, "Shall I sacrifice to him for my ungodliness my firstborn,
and for the iniquity of my soul, the fruit of my bosom?" The prophet adds:
"I will tell you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord expects of you,
nothing but to act according to justice and to love mercy and to be ready to
follow. the Lord your God. And the prophet David also says, "I will sing
before you mercy and justice, O Lord. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

after having provided them with the means to justify himself, that he brings
them to court, and that after having taught them how they can divest themselves
of their crimes, lest, finding them without excuse, he should be compelled to
condemn them. "And enter into discussion; As if he were saying, let's
start the judgment. This good judge is a lawyer and a doctor. Then to show
that, whatever our good deeds, we still need his charity to be delivered from
our sins, he says: "When your sins are like scarlet; I will make you as
white as snow; You see it, it takes diametrically opposite qualities, and
promises to change one into the other. "And when they are like vermilion,
I will make them white like wool. It is therefore very meritorious the
protection which is granted to widows, since of a soul so corrupted as to be
tainted by iniquity, it makes a soul not only pure, but so brilliant. "If
you will listen to me, you will eat the goods of the earth (19), and if you do
not want to listen to me, the sword will devour you: for it is the Lord who
uttered it with his mouth ( 20). Because these rude men looked upon it as less
desirable and less sweet to free themselves from their sins than to enjoy the
pretended goods of the present life, with the first thing he promises the
second, and makes it depend on that one.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. Then, to show how easy
virtue is, he places it in the will alone. But as the hope of these goods might
have softened the spirits, it ends with frightening things to make more
striking the power of the one who made these revelations. "How did she
become a prostitute, the faithful city of Sion (21)? This question shows the
pain of the one who makes it and the insensitivity of the Jews and what is
unexpected in this event. St. Paul makes a similar question to the Galatians:
"I am astonished that you are changing so quickly," which is like an
accusation and an exhortation to bring to virtue. This word doubtless
astonishes: but, as it is intermingled with praise, a new accusation
strengthens the other. We do not seek so much to correct those who are
worthless; who have never led but an abject life, than those who, after having
shown themselves at first virtuous, then turned to evil. He calls him a
prostitute, not that he wants to speak of the prostitution of the body, but of
the ingratitude of the soul, which is much worse than the other prostitution.
There it is on the man, here on God that the insult falls. And if Isaiah and
the other prophets speak thus, it is because God had deigned to let himself be
regarded as the husband of this city to show his ineffable charity for the
Jews, and the prophets often speak of the Lord and Jerusalem as a husband and
wife, not to lower their speech to human grossness, but to bring the Jews by
familiar examples to the knowledge of the love of God; at the same time they
wanted, by this shameful appellation of prostitute, to bring them to blush of
themselves. "Faithful," that is to say, religious and full of virtue:
which further shows that he does not speak of the prostitution of bodies, since
otherwise he would have had to say the chaste city; for this word would have
been opposed to prostitute; but to show that by prostitution he meant impiety,
he uses the opposite word, faith. "Full of iniquity," that is to say,
of justice. Here is another great accusation against this people, not only had
he rushed into all kinds of iniquities, but he had abandoned all the virtues,
that precious treasure of all the goods he held in his hands, he had rejected
it to reduce itself to the most frightful miseries. "In which" lived
justice. She remained there, said he, she lived there, that is to say, she was
planted there, rooted, and the citizens put all their ardor to keep it. By
emphasizing the praises of the past, it makes it more clear that change was
guilty, and at the same time gives hope, since it shows sinners that it would
be easy to regain what they lost. "And now it's the home of the murderers;
Homicide, he means. "Your money is impure (22)," that is, false,
altered, mixed. "Your merchants mix their wine with water. He has been
calling out from the beginning that he has not pointed out their wickedness in
each of his species, but that he has told them, in a general way, that they are
contempters, a perverse race, ungodly sons, terms which are more like insults
than accusations, it indicates here the various kinds of their crimes, and
places in the first place what is in the beginning, in the middle and at the
end of sins, the love of money, and fraud in contracts. Some who do not
understand the ineffable charity of God have taken this term in the apagogic
sense. Never, they say, would the great, the sublime Isaiah have spoken of the
deceits of the bankers, the tricks of the innkeepers; but he calls money the
oracles of God, and wine his doctrine which they mixed of their comments. For
me, without rejecting this interpretation, I say that the other is truer. Not
only is it not unworthy of a prophet to speak of these things, but it is very
worthy of him and of the charity of God. And why extend to this point? When the
only-begotten Son of God came to bring us his sublime teachings and to plant
the pure life of angels on our earth, he often spoke of measures, and of things
that seem still smaller, greetings, of the middle place, of the first rank.
Those things that seem small, if neglected, become the source of great sins.
But if all these things were to be settled in the New Testament, much more so
in the Old, when the hearers were rude, and their whole life was confined to
following these laws, since they had been instructed especially in to move away
from all injustice, to do no harm to one's neighbor, not to crush the poverty
of the poor by fraudulent mixtures.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. The contempt of these
laws caused cities to be overthrown, kings thrown from the throne, implacable
wars lit, and their observation more than once brought the peace, order, and
security necessary for virtue. "Your princes are unruly (23). This is
proof that the disease, the evil is very great, when the doctors even work to
increase it. It is up to kings to repress the evil instincts of their people,
to direct them towards good, and to make them subject to the laws; but when
they themselves are the first to break them, how can they teach others to
submit? When they say, "Are unruly," he means, do not obey the law,
reject the yoke of precepts; it is also what St. Paul reproaches them by
saying: "You who instruct others, do you not instruct yourself? When,
then, is the root corrupted, what are the branches waiting for? "They are
the accomplices of thieves. Here is what aggravates the fault is that, far from
preventing crimes, they favor them; Far from making war on thieves, they are in
league with them, and run to a perversity entirely opposed to the virtue of
princes. "Love the present. Here again is a new vice engendered by the
love of money, vice which, under an honest appearance, under the benevolence of
benevolence, hides the most sordid avarice. "Only seek gain. Grudge
against their enemies, hasten to render evil for evil, a very grave sin. Also,
the New and Old Testament care to repress it. "Let no man," he says,
"form in his heart bad designs against his brother. (Zac VII, 10.) For it
is necessary that the people, and still more the prince, be pure of all enmity,
he who must warn his subjects to submit to justice any private hatred, lest the
port should become an enemy. pitfall. "Do not do justice to the orphans.
That is to say, do not help them to obtain justice. "And the cause of the
widow has no access to them. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Notice that the Prophet
points out as an evil not only to do bad deeds, but also to not do good ones, a
doctrine that we find in the New Testament. For those who did not feed the
hungry poor, though they did not take away the good of others, but only because
they did not give their goods to those who were in need, are sent to the fire
of hell; likewise the Prophet blamed the princes of Zion not for what they are
either avaricious or tyrants, but for not granting their protection to those
who need it. "And this is what the Master says, the Lord of hosts, the
strong of Israel," 24 that is, of the people. It is not without reason
that he uses this term, the Fort, but to remind them of the benefits they have
obtained against all hope and the terrible punishments they have endured; as
after having often and much sinned, after having experienced the long-suffering
of God, they have fallen into sluggishness, he wants to show them that God can
avenge himself when he pleases, that he does not need favorable times,
opportune circumstances, that everything is under his hand and at his disposal.
"Woe to those who command in Israel! my fury against my enemies will have
no end. What is more unfortunate than those who have God as an enemy? "No
longer will he have an end," he says, not that he wants to throw them into
despair, but that a more strongly impressed fear will bring them to repentance.
For these words "my fury will have no end," are less terrible than
these, "against my enemies. There is nothing that irritates God, like the
injustice done to the poor. "Woe to those who command! He said, not to
condemn all power, but the power that does evil. The force of which he speaks
here is not the force of the body, but the force which circumstances give.
"And I will do justice to my adversaries. I will punish my enemies; he
calls his enemies the enemies of the poor, those who mistreat them; and he uses
this expression to show the greatness of the wrongdoing. "Thou shalt put
my hand on you, and I will purify you by fire." Know from there that the
wrath and vengeance of God, whatever they may be, is not for evil and
punishment, but for the very punishment of those who are punished. "And I
will cleanse you," he says, "by fire. So it is not when we are
punished, it is when peach holes that we must cry, since in the second case we
are defiling ourselves, while in the first we are purifying ourselves. What is
the virtue of this purification? To make sure there is no trace of defilement
in you; because fire is gold, punishment is for sinners. "Those who
disobey, I will lose them, I will remove from among you all the ungodly and I
will humble all the beautiful. "The incorrigible," he said, "and
those who will not give way to self-punishment, I will lose. What does it do
for them to live, since they use their lives only to procure evil and of
themselves and others? And those whom the punishment of those hardened can make
better will remain. It seems to me that he is referring here to captivity.
"And I will restore your judges as they once were, and your counselors as
they were in principle."</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

return. When the incorrigible will have disappeared, and those who are capable
of improvement will have become better, he shows (and this is the moment) how
he will complete the cure; it will be by giving good leaders and good advisers,
so that, all the body having felt the effect of the remedies and good doctors
continuing their care, all the members return from all sides to the health. It
is not a slight blessing to (348) procure good princes. "And after that
you will be called the city of justice and Zion the faithful city. And yet we
do not find anywhere that this name has been given to the city of Jerusalem.

use to us when the Jews ask us for the interpretation of Emmanuel's name. As
Isaiah predicted that Christ would be called that and nowhere has he received
this name, we will tell them that he calls the event itself, as in the passage
we are examining. "By justice and mercy it will be delivered from captivity."
(27) "By justice," that is, by the punishment, the punishment, and
the persecution that it will suffer his enemies. "By mercy," that is,
by charity. He promises them two great favors, which captives will be punished,
and that they will then enjoy a great peace, two things of which one alone
would be enough to make them very happy, and which together give an
unimaginable joy. And to show again in another way that after this long
captivity, they should their return not to what they would have by a
proportionate punishment, expiated their faults, but to his only goodness, that
their salvation would be the work of his goodness and not the result of a
compensation and a kind of exchange, he adds: "by mercy. "The wicked

left to seduce and entice them; the teachers of iniquity will be gone.

caught in a net, while no one will come to rescue them and put an end to this
storm because they will be abandoned by God, then the only experience will

sufficient even before misfortunes had come to instruct these impious ones, it
was enough to confound them to show them that these idols are the work of men.
What more shameful indeed than to make a god! "And they will blush gardens
where they surrendered so eagerly. Not only did they worship statues, but even
trees in the gardens. "They will be like the terebinth that has lost its
leaves." 30 These idols or those who live in the city. He borrows his
comparison from this tree, because it grows in this country and is not uncommon
because it has many flowers and foliage in the favorable season, and is very
ugly on the contrary, when he lost his leaves. "And like a garden without
water. This second image is clearer than the first and confirms what I said
about that one. For there is nothing more pleasant than a verdant garden, and
there is nothing more sad than a bare garden: the city of Sion has been in
these two conditions. At all times she had been good, brilliant, adorned with a
thousand beauties; and she has become more vile, more dishonored than any
other, having suddenly lost so many ornaments. "And their strength will be
like dry tow (31). His previous images showed ugliness, this one weakness, all
are very energetic, clear and striking. "As the tow is dry," that is
to say, weak. "And their works as a spark of fire. Here he shows that
their evils come from them, that they themselves have drawn captivity on their
heads, that they have themselves lit the fire that devours them. As sparks
light a fire where they fall, so their sins, by accumulating, inflamed the
wrath of God. "The wicked and sinners will burn together without anyone to
extinguish the fire. If he still seems to deprive them of all hope of
salvation, it is always for the same reason, not for them to despair, but for
them to be struck with a strong fear, to shake their softness. And from there
we can take another lesson, that one can not overcome his power, and that when
he punishes and punishes, no one can oppose him and put an end to evil.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

in the world, and the peace that will reign. If, in speaking of the

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">1. This title teaches us
clearly that the prophets did not give at once their prophecies, but that
inspired in different times, they published, on several occasions, different
parts which gathered then formed all the book that bears their name. This is
why Isaiah begins as we have just seen. This is not the only proof that makes
us what we are going forward, clear and obvious; the Prophet still tells us
this by mentioning the times, saying earlier: "The year Nathan came to
Azoth (Isaiah, CCI); Now: "And it came to pass, in the year that King
Uzziah died, that I saw the Lord seated on an elevated and sublime throne.
(Isaiah, VI, 1.) For if the Epistles of St. Paul and the Gospels were composed
of a single jet, it is not the same with the prophecies, but, as I have just
said, they have been made in various times. So the Prophet begins his story
with another title. A new proof that these are detached parts is that what he
is going to talk about is far removed from what he said above and much more
sublime. The vocation of the Gentiles, the brilliancy of preaching, the
knowledge of the religion spread throughout the earth, the peace reigning here
below, is its subject. And if, while preparing to treat this matter, he makes
mention of Judea and Jerusalem, you must not be surprised, his words were a
prophecy disguised under these names. In the same way David, composing psalm
LXX1, gave him the title, On Solomon, which does not prevent him from speaking
of things so sublime as they can not suit Solomon or even any man. These
expressions, "His name existed before the sun, His throne existed before
the moon (Ps. LXXI, 17, 15)," and the like, no one, no matter how foolish,
will apply them to a man. Likewise Jacob: when he announced what Isaiah will
speak to us here, and other events even greater, since, besides the vocation of
the Gentiles, he predicts the passion, the resurrection and the time of the
advent of the Messiah, he did not do it in an open manner, but concealing these
things under the name of his son, as if he had only announced what was to
happen to Judah; but, as the event proved, he prophesied things that looked
only at Christ. Indeed, Judah was not the expectation of the nations, his tribe
did not shine when the Jewish nation lost independence; but all this was
realized by the coming of Christ.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">That if the Jews had the
impudence to (350) reject this interpretation of the prophecies, what has just
been said would suffice to refute them; We must carefully explain the
prophecies, weigh all the terms with the proper attention, and compare the
prediction with the event. And in order to bring more proof than it takes to
close their mouths, choosing my examples in what has been predicted not of
Christ, but of their patriarchs, I will strive to make it clear to them that
most prophecies have been made under the name of tribal chiefs and have only
been realized in their descendants. And when I have reported one or two
testimonies, I will have reached my goal. When Jacob, having called Simeon and
Levi, told them what was to happen to them, he said, "Simeon and Levi,
brothers (Genesis xvii. Then, after reproaching them with their iniquity, and
the unjust slaughter of the Sichemites, he continues, "I will divide them
into Jacob and scatter them in Israel." This was certainly not done for
Simeon and Levi, but for the tribes who descended from them. For the tribe of
Levi was scattered, so that each of the other tribes had the tenth; it was
almost the same with the tribe of Simeon, who was scattered among the others,
and who did not obtain a compact territory like them. Jacob, who had received
blessings from his father, did not see any of them come to life. His father had
predicted a long prosperity, a perpetual domination over Esau; and yet he lacked
necessary things, he lived in domesticity, and far from dominating his brother,
he ran the greatest danger, and once he met him, he was seized with such fear
that he felt too happy to have been able to escape him. What will we answer to
that? That prophecy is only a lie? No, but she usually assigns to some people
what should happen to others and that she changes the names. This is what
happened again for Chanaan. We do not see him anywhere as a slave to his
brothers; and however far the curse was withdrawn, it is fulfilled in the
Gabaonites, descendants of Chanaan. Noah's words were a prophecy in the form of
a curse.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. When, then, so many
great examples show us that many things predicted for them have been
accomplished in those, and that the prophets change the names, what is there
any wonder at all? what does Isaiah, though speaking of Judea and Jerusalem,
have in mind only the Church? As he addressed ungrateful men who killed the
prophets, burned their books, overturned the altars, a veil covered their eyes
when they read the Old Testament, as St. Paul says. For they would have
annihilated the Bible if they had understood the strength of the prophecies
concerning Christ. If, despite his presence, his miracles, the evident proofs
of his power, his union, and his intimacy with the Father, they could not
venerate him, if they did not cease to pursue him until they If they had
crucified, would they have spared those who spoke of him, and even without this
motive, they tormented continually? Also, it was under names that were familiar
and known to all, that they hid their prophecies. That the prophecies do not
relate to Judea and Jerusalem is what we will fully demonstrate by examining
each expression. "In the last days the mountain of the Lord will manifest
itself to all eyes (2). See the accuracy of the Prophet who, not only
announcing the event, even predicts the time. What St. Paul says "When the
fullness of time came (Galati IV, 4)," and again in another place,
"in the dispensation of the fulness of the times (Ephesians I, 10),"
it is this that the Prophet expresses in these terms "in the last days.
The mountain designates the Church and her invincible dogmas. Even when
countless armies would attack a mountain, darting arrows, throwing javelins, maneuvering
machines of war, what would all these efforts lead to a shameful retreat of
these armies after the complete exhaustion of their forces? So it was with all
those who declared war on the Church, they did not shake it, and after the loss
of their power they withdrew covered with confusion, exhausted by the blows
that they bore, weakened by the features they launched, vanquished, they who
exercised persecution by those who suffered it: a strange victory, impossible
for men and given only to God alone.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What is admirable is not
that the Church has conquered, but has conquered in this way. Pursued, hunted
down, struck with (351) thousand ways, not only did she not weaken, but she
took further increments, and her patience alone defeated her adversaries; that
is what the diamond makes art iron: struck, it breaks the one who strikes it;
this is what the sting does to the recalcitrant; he does not become dull, he
sorted his feet with blood, the one he reaches. This is why the Church is
called a mountain. If the Jew does not want to admit this metaphor, let him be
confused by himself. The Prophet says that wolves and lambs will have common
pastures, that God will whine the flies and bees with a whistle, that he will
bring down on the Jews the violent waters of a river because they have rejected
the water of Siloë. (Isaiah XI, 6, LXV 25, VII, 18, VIII, 6.) These words taken
literally are not intelligible; but stick to what they mean, and that is when
you will understand the future differently. What, do they mean? By the wolves
and the lambs the Prophet hears the characters of men, some cruel, others full
of sweetness; by the flies, the impudence of the Egyptians; by the river, the
violence of the barbarian army; by the fountain of Siloë, the clemency and
moderation of the leader of the people of the King of the Jews. No one, however
wise, will contradict us on this point. So, just as he designates all these
things under foreign names, he has also expressed allegorically by this word
"mountain" the stability, the invincible force, the height, the
impregnable, the indomitable power of the Church. Another prophet also likens
to a mountain those who believe in God to show that they are invincible.
"It will manifest itself to all eyes." Our words are useless for
explaining these words, for the very state of things makes a voice sound louder
than that of the trumpet to publish the glory of the Church; the sun and its
light are less visible than it. "The house of God will be established on
the top of the mountains. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. How will a Jew interpret
this? Because the temple is not on the top of the mountains. But the power of
the Church rises to the heavens, and just as a house on the top of a mountain
can be seen by all, so much more is the Church visible. to all eyes. "And
it will rise above the hills. Here again is a circumstance which has never been
applicable to the temple of Jerusalem, even at the moment of its greatest
splendor. How to apply it to a temple that the Jews themselves have often
dishonored and that the hands of the barbarians have destroyed? But our
powerful Church has been much more often and more terribly tested; however, it
never gave in to the attacks of its enemies, and their efforts themselves only
served to raise it up and make it more visible. Then legions of martyrs,
multitudes of confessors met, souls harder than iron and surpassing in
brightness the stars: their bodies were torn to pieces, but their soul, far
from being vanquished, triumphed and was crowned. Whoever has ever seen, who
has ever heard that men who received death received a crown, that men who were
slaughtered won the victory, and that an army became so much more illustrious,
that the enemies had killed him more men ?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And all nations
will come to her. As he advances the Prophet becomes more explicit, he reveals
his thought more fully, holds a clearer and cleaner language to shut the mouths
of the Jews. For whatever their impudence, they can not apply these words to
their temple. Indeed, it was forbidden, and this defense was perfectly
followed, to receive the nations in this temple. And what am I saying, to
receive the nations in the temple? As for the Jews themselves, the law
prohibited under the most serious threats all commerce with the nations and
severely punished the transgressors! The prophet Haggai has only this goal in
all his prophecy, to blame, to take back, to judge these illicit alliances. But
for us it is not so; the Church opens her bosom with the utmost ease, and
receives with open arms every day all the nations of the earth. For the first
teachers of our doctrine have received this command from the Son, and it is
(his mouth that they have heard this saying: "Go and teach all
nations." (Matt xxvIII, 19.) See also as the Prophet speaks not only of
the vocation of the Gentiles, but also of their prompt and eager obedience.He
does not say "shall be brought," but "will come, a truth which
another prophet shows us in (352) terms more The fellow will no longer teach
his fellow-citizen, nor his brother, saying, "Learn to know the Lord,
because all will know me from the least to the greatest." For the Jews the
elements were changing. their nature were continual threats, repeated
chastisements, frequent wonders, warning prophets, the fear of the legislator,
imminent wars, incursions of barbarians, the wrath of God manifested, f the
souls sent by heaven, and they remained no less hard-headed and uncircumcised
of heart, as St. Stephen says, obstinate and stubborn, while for the nations it
suffices for a word, a word, and all come together. to the Church. This is what
David says with these words: "The people that I did not know became my
servant" (Ps. XVII, 45). And admiring his obedience, he adds: "No
sooner had he heard me obey. Jacob also indicates the same thing under this
figure: "He will bind his donkey to the vine, and the young of his donkey
to the branch." Who has ever tied to a branch, and attached to a vine a
donkey that did not damage the fruit? In animals it does not happen, but in men
it is often done. The Jews, whom a thousand chains subjugated, shook the yoke,
broke the bond, as the Prophet says; but the nations, who did not know this
necessity, listened with docility, like a colt tied to the branch, without the
precepts charging them; Far from it, they stood near the vineyard and showed admirable
docility. "Many people will come and say, Come, let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (3). See them indulging
in their feasts, holding their assemblies, exciting one another, and becoming
all the teachers of one another; see not one, not two, not three, but many
running together. Because, he says, there will come many different peoples and
countries, which has not happened for the Jews; if some came, it was only a
small number of proselytes, obtained with great difficulty; it was not the
nations that were called, but the proselytes: "Proselytes will come to you
and be your servants. (Isaiah, LIV, 15.) If the Prophet continues the same
metaphor and calls the house of the God of Jacob to the mountain, do not be
surprised. For, as I have said, he renders his prophecy sometimes clearer,
sometimes more obscure; more obscure, to give the most intelligent the means of
understanding what is said; clearer, in order to repress the discontent and the
troubles which the ungrateful would like to excite; it is thus that everywhere
he varies his language.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. Do not be surprised,
my dear brother, by what he said, "God of Jacob; For the only begotten Son
of God was God of Jacob. He gave the law and did all the signs that the descendants
of Jacob saw; This is easy to see in the Old Testament: for the New the Jews
ignore it. Jeremiah says, "I will make a new covenant with them, but not
according to the covenant that I made with their fathers (Jeremiah XXXI, 31,
32)," showing that he was the author of one of them. as of the other law.
He adds that he delivered them from the bondage of Egypt: "The day I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. If it is he who
brought them out of Egypt, it is he who has worked so many wonders both in
Egypt and in the desert. - "He will show us his way and we will walk
there. Do you see how they ask for another law? For holy scripture ordinarily
calls the commandments of God; if he had wanted to speak of the Old Testament,
he would not have said: "He will make us known; Because this ancient law,
all of them knew it clearly, fully.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">These are not sophisms,
but solid proofs, made to convince even the most obstinate. Not content to
mention only this new way, he still says what way he wants to speak and
indicates many signs that distinguish it. For he continues in these terms:
"The law shall come from Zion, and the word of the Lord of Jerusalem. To
this the most impudent Jews can not answer. Indeed, that these words were said
of the New Testament; This is clearly indicated by the place and the time and
the condition of those who received the law and the events. who followed her.
And first the place, the mountain of Zion. The law of Moses was given to the
ancestors of the Jews on Sinai. How, then, can he say "Zion?" And
(353) without being satisfied with the place, he still mentions time, because
he does not say, "The law is gone out," but "the law will come
out," this who looks at the future time and not a past event. But when the
Prophet spoke thus, the law was given for many years, and the New Testament was
to be given long after. So he does not say, "Has gone out," but
"will come out," that is to say, in the course of time. He returns
again to the mention of the place and says: "And the word of the Lord will
come out of Jerusalem. It is here especially that it clearly indicates to us
one of the distinctive characters of the New Testament. Sometimes it was
sitting on the mountain that Our Lord dictated sublime and heavenly precepts,
sometimes it was in Jerusalem that He did it. After the indication of the place
and the time, the Prophet gives that of the persons who were to receive the new
law, and thus closes absolutely and in any case the mouth to the contradictors.
Who are the disciples of the Gospel? The Hebrew people, the children of the
Jews? No, but the nations. He adds, "He will exercise his judgment among
the nations." 4 The essence of the law is above all to condemn those who
fight it. Now it is not a question of the ancient law; that's what the things
themselves show. We do not keep the Sabbath, the circumcision, the feasts,
nothing of all that the Jews observed. We heard Paul say to us, "If you
are circumcised, Christ will serve you nothing (Galatians 2); And again:
"You observe certain days, months, times and years; I fear I have worked
in vain among you. (Galatians, IV, 10) It is therefore evident that he speaks
of the new law, since he will exercise his judgment among the nations,
according to what St. Paul says: "In the day when God will judge what he
There is hidden in men. How will he judge, tell me? according to the Old
Testament? No, but "according to my gospel. Do you see that if the words
are different, your thoughts are the same? Isaiah says, "He will exercise
judgment among the nations. St. Paul says, "He will judge according to my
gospel. "And he will convict a great multitude," his adversaries,
those who transgressed the law. This is what Christ teaches us in these terms:
"I will not judge you; but the word that I have announced will be your
judge. »(John, XII, 48.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And they shall
smite plowshares and their spears with their swords. One people will no longer
draw sword against another people, and they will no longer practice fighting.
The Prophet did not content himself with the first clues; As the truth is rich
in testimonies which make it known, Isaiah still points to the New Testament by
another mark, but so brilliant that all the earth has been able to observe it.
What is this brand? Peace and the cessation of wars. When these things happen,
he says, the world will be in such tranquility that war money will be used to
forge instruments of agriculture. Something that we do not see anywhere in the
history of the Jews; far from it, during all the time of their existence as a nation,
they never ceased either to carry the war abroad, or to receive it, and
constantly they were harassed by enemies, sometimes more, sometimes less long
time. And the very peoples of Palestine often attacked them with so much force
that they made them run the greatest dangers.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. This is attested by
the books of kings, which contain only stories of wars; this is what the
prophets attest to us, either when they tell the story of the past, or when
they predict future events; in a word, from that day when they shook the yoke
of the Egyptians, their entire history was but a war. But today it is no longer
the case; on all the earth reigns peace. If there are still some wars, they do
not look like those of the past. Then we were going to break cities against cities,
countries against countries, peoples against peoples; the same nation was
divided into a great number of parties. Read the book of Joshua and Judges, and
you will see that wars Palestine had to support in a short time. Even worse,
the law ordered everyone to take up arms and no one was exempt from this duty.
And it was not only among the Jews that this custom existed, but all over the
world; the rhetors themselves and the philosophers who possessed only their
cloaks, covered themselves, when the war called them, with the shield, and
marched in the ranks of the army, and this philosopher (354) of Athens, so
peaceful and so wise, Socrates, the son of Sophronicus, appeared twice on the
field of battle. And the most illustrious of their orators, Demosthenes, often
came down from the tribune to go and fight. But if the law exempted neither the
speakers nor the philosophers, there were few clones who enjoy this exemption.
Today you do not see the same things happening anymore. Since the sun of
righteousness has shone upon us, cities, peoples, nations, all are so far
removed from the war and its dangers that they no longer know how to handle
weapons; but, tranquil in the bosom of their cities and under the protection of
their walls, they intend to recount distant wars, all the people live in peace,
having no longer to deal with this terrible duty. If there are still wars
today, it is at the extremities of the Roman Empire, and no longer, as
formerly, in every city, in every province. Then, as I said, in the same nation
there were continually numerous seditions and party wars; but now all that the
sun illuminates, from the Tigris to the British Isles, and besides, Libya,
Egypt, Palestine, in a word all that is subject to the scepter of the Romans
lives in peace; you know that the cities enjoy a profound tranquility and that
they know the war only to hear about it. Christ could remove these last
remnants of war; but he allowed, for the punishment of those indolent people
whom peace would sleep, he allowed, I say, the incursions of the barbarians.
The words of the Prophet, for those who understand them well, announce (I have
already said) that there will be only seditions of little importance. For he
did not say, "There will be no more war; But: "One people will no longer
draw the sword against another people," and afterwards it shows how free
the peoples will be, "they will no longer practice fighting," save a
few knotted men, to this profession. "And now, house of Jacob, come and
walk in the light of the Lord (5.)" He rejected his people, the house of
Jacob (6). After completing his prophecy on the Church, he returns to history,
as if to repeat his words. For it was the custom of the prophets to shade the
prophecies either by the terms they used or by passing abruptly from one
subject to another. Thus suddenly interrupting his prophecy, and without
transition, as if he continued the same subject, Isaiah comes to give warnings
to the Jews: "Now, house of Jacob, come and walk in the light of the
Lord," c. that is to say, in his commandments, in his law: for "the
precept of the law is a lamp, a light, life, a rebuke, and a discipline"
(Prov.VI, 23); David also says, "The precept of the Lord is filled with
light, he gives light to the eyes (Ps. And again: "Your law is a lamp that
illuminates my feet and a light in my paths. (Ps. CXVIII, 105.) Everywhere you
will see the same name given to the law. Thus St. Paul says: "You flatter
yourself to be the guide of the blind, the light of those who are in darkness,
the doctor of the ignorant." (Romans II, 19, 20.) the sun does not
illuminate the eyes of our body as the precepts of the law illuminate the eyes
of our souls.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. To show that even
before the reward, before the day of remunerations, the precepts bring their
reward, in the very time when they are fulfilled, he calls them light. For just
as the eye is strengthened by this alone that it is enlightened, so our soul,
by that alone that it obeys your law, derives the greatest fruit; it is
purified there, removed from evil and brought to virtue. On the contrary, the
prevaricators,. even before the day of vengeance, they are punished by that
alone that they prevaricate, since they are in a worse condition than men
plunged in the darkness, that they are filled with fear, fear, remorse, that in
at midday they fear everyone, those who know their sin, as those who do not
know him. "He rejected his people, the house of Jacob," that is to
say, he let him go, abandoned him, despised, deprived of his kindness. Then,
after having frightened them, he tells them the cause of this abandonment, so
that they correct what they have done wrong. What is this couse? "Because
their land, like the land of strangers, is covered with their omens. In the
first place he reproached them with their fraud, their avarice, their contempt
for widows; he reproaches them here with their bad beliefs and those remnants
of impiety which led them little by little to the false worship of demons.
Then, in (355) the intention of beating them hard, he says not only that they
are giving themselves to the augurs, but that "their country is filled
with them. Their malice has increased to the greatest extent, he means; just
now he said people, not only sinful, but full of sins, so here he says earth
"full of omens. Then, in order to bring out the reproach of their conduct,
in a still more striking way, he adds: "As from the beginning. From the
beginning? When? When they did not yet know the Lord, yet had not received his
law, or experienced his benefits, when they were still in the midst of the
nations: this is their great crime, not to have become, after so much care and
goodness, better than they were before having received its benefits. And
without stopping there, he adds, to frighten them, "like the land of
strangers," and by this comparison he aggravates the accusation. This is
what St. Paul does continually, for example, when he says, "I do not want,
my brethren, that you are ignorant of those who sleep, so that you do not
grieve like all others do. who have no hope (I Thess., IV, 72); And again:
"Let every one of you know how to possess his body holy and honestly, and
not in the passion of lust. (Ibid, 4.) And without being satisfied with this,
he adds these words: "Like other nations that do not know God. (Ibid, 5.)
For this reproach ordinarily stings even those who have fallen very low.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But if the Jews suffer
these reproaches, what indulgence, what excuse will we find, who, showered with
so many graces, clothed with so much honor, having received eternal hopes, have
fallen into the same miseries as themselves? Many, still today, worked by this
disease, ruin themselves their existence, abandoning themselves to the madness
of auguries; besides offending God, they gain only pains which they could have
avoided, and lose all the vigor necessary to the combats of virtue. For the
devil strives by all means to persuade these fools that he does not depend on
them to be virtuous or vicious, that they have not been endowed with free will,
and this to obtain these two frightening things, which they recoil before the
struggles required by virtue and abandon their liberty, one of their most
beautiful prerogatives. This is the fatal result which, by omens, by omens, by
the observance of certain days, by the hateful belief in destiny, and by many
other practices, he has already reached: he has upset everything. This is the
object of the vehement objurgations of the prophet who wants to tear the root
of evil. "And many foreign sons were born to them. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. What to say,
"foreign sons? God had forbidden them, because of their inconstancy and
fragility, to have relations with the rest of men, lest by this commerce they
should allow themselves to be led to idolatry. As far removed from being able
to straighten others, they were not even able to resist the training of the bad
example. God establishes a law to protect them, he first removes them from the
commerce of other nations, and thus separated from the rest of the world, he
applies himself to directing and training them. It would have been to wish that
with all these measures they could preserve the discipline to which God had
subjected them. If they despised the other precepts, they no longer respected
this one, they entered into relations with the neighboring peoples, took women
from the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the other idolatrous nations, and having
entered into their kinship, they admire among them teachers of iniquity and
lost their greatness and purity. "Their land was filled with gold and
silver and their treasures were infinite (7). "Their country was full of
horses and their chariots were innumerable (8). But what does it mean, one
might say, the reproach of having riches, of owning horses, especially for this
people, who were not yet called to a life so perfect? What to answer to this? That
it is not the use he blames, but their intention that was not right. Just as,
when he says, "Woe to the mighty (Is. It is not the authority he attacks,
but those who use it badly; likewise here he blames the Jews not because they
have treasures, but because they amassed them superfluous, and well beyond what
was necessary. "Their treasures," he says, "were infinite."
And besides, he blames them for their pride in their wealth and the multitude
of their horses, they gradually learned not to put their hope in God anymore. ;
it is also what another prophet says: "Woe to those who trust in their
strength and who glorify themselves in the abundance of their riches! (Psalm
XLVIII, 7.) And in another place: "It is not in his great power that a
king will find his salvation, and the giant will not be saved by his
extraordinary strength. Psalm XXXII, 16.) And in another Psalm it is said
again: "He does not like to be trusted by the strength of the horse, and
it does not please him that man should the agility of his legs. The Lord looks
with pleasure on those who fear him. (Ps. CXL, 10.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Their country was
filled with idols, execrable works with their hands, and they loved what they
had formed with their fingers. Like a skilful doctor, the Prophet indicates the
cause and source of the disease. As he was going to reproach them for their
impiety, he has just indicated the source of their illness, avarice, excesses
of every kind, illicit alliances, and shows them that they have thus gradually
slid to the bottom of their the abyss and ended up worshiping idols. Then to
mock their worship he adds "works of their hands. For what can be more
ridiculous than to see the creative man of a God? Scripture often calls
abomination idols; Beyond it calls the abomination of desolation the idol
placed in the temple: "When you see the abomination of desolation standing
in the holy place, let him who reads understand. After having diverted them
from sensible things, he forbids them to make any image; and he gives it the
name of an abomination to drive them away from (ungodliness, for to have a
thing in abomination is to hate it with force, as impure, as execrable.) What
is hateful and worthy of execration, Scripture calls it an abomination, and so
it is with every idol: "They worshiped what they had formed with their
fingers." 9 And they humbled themselves, and men humbled themselves. God's
worship is a matter of relief, that of idols lowers and humbles: what is lower
than the fallen man of the way of salvation, having God as an enemy, prostrating
himself before inanimate things and worshiping stones! God has called us to
such He has raised us above heaven, but the demon lowers his servants to make
them more foolish than unfeeling things, and the Prophet says, "Men have
humbled themselves." heal those who still have some sense, but as most men
fear less sin than punishment, he announces in these terms the punishment:
"I will not forgive them. They will not have to hope for indulgence,
pardon or negligence to punish; they will give a severe account of their
crimes, they will expiate them. "And now enter the caves, hide yourself in
the earth not to see the terrible face of the Lord (10). After mocking the
madness of the idolaters, having shown their madness and the vanity of idols,
since they are the work of men, he comes again to attack them with these words,
and leaving to experience the care of justifying what he said, he adds: It was
not enough to have shown the error and madness of idolaters, by that only idols
are made; but since, heavy and blinded by impiety as if by a kind of
intoxication, they do not perceive the clearest and most obvious things, so
many calamities will melt on the city that the most stupid will learn how
insane they are. and how great is the power of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. Also before speaking
of the war, he indicates the consequences; told them to enter the caves, to
hide even under the ground, and why? To teach them how much will be the
implacable then the wrath of God. "Hide yourself," said he,
"into the bosom of the earth, not to see the terrible face of the Lord,
nor the glory of his power, when he will rise to strike the earth. He does not
simply say before his great power, but before the glory of his power, his
actions, his victories will be great! they will have splendor and splendor! It
seems to me that he indicates here the victory of Hezekiah, that he hears by
the earth, the multitude of men who dwelt on it, by the earth struck by their
ruin, by resurrection the help by which God saved his people. For David said,
"May God arise and his adversaries be routed (Ps. LXVII, 2)! And again:
"Arise, O God, judge the earth" (LXXXI, 8), "where he expresses
the acts of God by images borrowed from men. - "The eyes of the Lord are
high and the man is nothing (11). And so that none of his hearers will refuse
to believe his words (for many this event was unexpected and quite unexpected),
the Prophet recalls the power of the One who acts and the weakness of the one
who suffers. There is, he says, (357) nothing higher than God, nothing lower than
man. Do not be surprised, therefore, that being so great and so strong, he can
so humble men so weak. And it is with reason that he says: "The eyes glued
Lord are high; He did not say power, but the eyes of the Lord, because his
sight alone is enough to make all obstacles disappear. That's what David says
in other words, "He who looks at the earth and trembles" (Ps. CIII,
32); And another prophet again: "I will look on him and I will triumph
over him. »(Hosea, XI, 4.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"The greatness of
man will be lowered, and the Lord alone will be exalted on this day. After this
unexpected victory, this triumph, so brilliant and so admirable, the demons
were vanquished, the idols slaughtered, the false prophets had their mouths
closed, the barbarians saw their tyranny broken, and every enemy's mouth of God
was shut up. This is why he says, "The Lord alone will be exalted on this
day. Henceforth, there will be no contradiction or doubt about the power of
God, when events have brought him so much into evidence. By herself she is
elevated, her greatness has no beginning, she still exists, and if one says
that she is exalted, it is in the thought of men, because the enemies and the
contradictors , realizing the facts, will recognize her humbly and bless her
properly. "The day of the Lord of Hosts will break out on all the proud
and the proud, on all the insolent and the proud men, and they will be humbled
(12). It will burst forth on those of the cedars of Lebanon which are large and
high and on all the oaks of Casan (13), on all the high mountains and walls
(14), on every high tower (15), on all the ships and on what makes ships
beautiful (16). And the greatness of man shall be low, and the Lord alone shall
be exalted in that day. "17 By walls, by cedar, by hill, by oak, he hears
the mighty, and by the height of these trees he refers metaphorically to their
power; and speaking of ships and the beauty of ships, they are the richest
among the people he hears.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">9. What he means is this:
That all great, all-powerful, all-righteous, all-rich, every man, so to speak,
clothed with power and dignity, will disappear at this time and faint and in
all these greatness nothing will be able to shield anyone from the anger of
God, neither the force of the body, nor the military skill, nor the abundance
of riches, nor the possession of power, nor the power of a great army, or
anything like it. He calls them cedars of Lebanon either because these trees
grow in abundance on this mountain, or because the announced events will arrive
soon; by the ornaments of the ships, he hears the greatness which the generals
give to their riches, their arms, their satellites. It seems to me also that
the invasion of the barbarians will be of long duration. "And they will
hide all their idols (18); they will carry them into the caves and clefts of
the rocks, into the dens of the earth, to make them disappear from before the
terrible face of the Lord, from the glory of his power, when he will rise up to
strike the earth (19 ). "Very far," he said, "that the gods
bring some help to men, they themselves will need the help of men and hidden
hiding places to disappear" from the terrible face of the Lord, from the
glory of his power. when he will rise to hit the ground. Because, lest these
things be attributed to the incursion of barbarians and we believe that this
fear is the effect of their power, it goes back to the God of the universe,
saying that He is the one who directs this war, and it is his power which,
dwelling on sinners, puts them in danger. "In that day man will reject his
abominable idols of silver or gold that he had made himself to worship vain
things and bats (20), and they will enter the cracks of stones and caves rocks
so as not to see the terrible face of the Lord and the glory of His power when
He will rise up to strike the earth (21). He has mocked them enough, showing
them that they have hidden with their gods, that they have penetrated into the
bosom of the earth, that the richness of the matter of their idols has not
relaxed them in any way whatsoever. who overwhelmed them. He called their idols
bats, either because of their weakness, or because of the darkness of error, or
because the demons are nothing but in the darkness. For just as bats hate the
sun and the light, while they love darkness, (358) even demons and those whom
they have trained love and seek vice and all that is contrary to the good.
while they hate virtue and the works of light, and when they shine, they hide
at the earliest, while he who loves virtue feels no discomfort, no fatigue. It
is enough for him to appear to dispel these shadows. "Cease to hope in the
man whose life is but a breath," and what case did they make of it (22)?
Here it seems to me that he points out to Hezekiah that fear and terror had
reduced him to nothing but a breath of life. The barbarians, having taken it as
if in a net, thought they were already holding their prey, and looked upon the
siege and capture of the city as costing them no effort, and precisely the
opposite happened. This is why the Prophet said: "Stop putting your hope
in the man whose life is only a breath, and what case did they make of it? That
is to say, they did not make any case. For they thought they were taking
everything away from the race, and it was precisely the opposite that happened,
and the one among us who seemed nothing and that we thought easy to attack,
shone more than all the others, because he was supported by the power of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

only the health of the sick whom he nurses, so our God, in his charity,
punishing. various inconstant and sinful Jews, sometimes frightened those
ungrateful by the invasion of the barbarians, sometimes before this invasion
even stops them by other threats, to maintain in them an ever new fear by
always showing them new calamities which would strike them. . Now, therefore,
he threatens them with the infirmity of famine, drought, deprivation not of the
necessary things, but of those which are nevertheless useful for the
preservation of life. Famine is not the only evil to be feared; it is no less
fatal to have no one at the head of affairs; for then the very abundance of
things is sadder than famine. What is the point that everything flows as if it
were a source, if it arises from civil wars, if the sea is agitated and in the
midst of the fury of the waves there is neither commander nor pilot, nobody
finally soothe the storm and calm down? When hunger comes on top of that, see
the excess of evil. God threatens all these calamities, and the first is also
the most serious. "Here is the Master, the Lord of hosts. The prophets
constantly use the word "here" when they want to fully certify to the
listener the truth of what they say. It is not only here, but previously, and
even from the beginning, that it has been seen that the infirmity of the body
was often only the punishment of faults, for example for Cain; as he made of
his strength a use contrary to reason, it was with good reason that it was
withdrawn from him. Likewise the paralytic of the pool; that his sins were the
cause of his paralysis, Christ affirms it: "Behold, you are healed, sin no
more. (John, V, 14.) And Paul says, "There are many among you who are
infirm. They had indeed sinned by bringing to the participation of the
mysteries an impure conscience. And he delivers to the infirmity of the body
the fornicator to whom he had announced that this would be a punishment for his
crimes. Yet it is not everywhere the result of sin; it is sometimes a trial
that will later be crowned, as it happened to Lazare and job. It is not only
infirmity, it is also the other evils of the body that come to us because of
our sins, like the leprosy of Uzziah because of his impudence, the paralysis of
the hand of King Jeroboam because of his arrogance and his pride. And the
language of Zechariah, why was she chained, except for the sin that he had
committed in his soul? As health, strength, body and prosperity became an
opportunity for the Jews to take pride in themselves, the Lord cuts the evil in
its root by warning them, making them better and giving them goods greater than
those which he takes them away. What harm is there to the body suffering if the
soul is brought to virtue? And so that they could not regard this infirmity as
a natural thing, the Prophet foretold it; and it is not to men alone that this
threat is addressed: the punishment extends to women, since both sexes are
defiled, and in the following it is addressed to women to because of the excesses
of their faults, and he reproaches them for the crimes which have overthrown
the city from top to bottom. He also threatens them with the plague, for it is
the plague which he seems to me to indicate by these words: "I am going to
remove the strong man and the strong woman," or some other infirmity of
the body which will not yield to the art of medicine. For such are the plagues
sent by God. "The strength of the bread and the strength of the water. It
is a terrible punishment to see the disappearance, not the substance, but the
strength it contained, so that the very sight punishes us because our hunger
can not be satisfied and shows us that it is there an effect of divine wrath.
"The giant and the powerful. Scripture generally calls giant any man strong
or who surpasses the others by the proportion of his members. Indeed, when she
says in the story of creation: "They were men called giants (Gen. VI,
4)," it is not that she makes us see in them another race, but she we show
them strong, robust and vigorous. "The man of war and the judge. It is an
unbearable punishment, it is the mark of complete ruin; the walls and towers
are standing, and yet the city could fall with its inhabitants into the hands
of the enemies! For the safety of the cities does not lie in the stones, in the
wood, in the walls, but in the wisdom of their inhabitants, and when they are
such, they will be, in the presence of the enemies, the best bulwark of their
homeland; when on the contrary they are without wisdom, the city more wretchedly
uses than if it were besieged.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. Also, for these
sinners and for all those who will hear it, it is a great lesson of wisdom that
the Prophet gives, teaching that one should not put his trust in the greatness
of a city, in the ditches and machines that defend it, but in the virtue of
good people. He tells them, then, to frighten them that the Lord will take away
from them that which protects them, not only men who know how to fight, but
even judges (360) who are no less useful to states than men of war, since they
ensure the preservation of peace and that often they divert wars imminent. As
iniquities continually tend to produce these wars, it is possible for the
guardians of the law, for men who are perfectly acquainted with the law, to
remove any cause of war; rhyming most sins? Why, then, does God remove them
from the Jews? Because they did not listen to them. His teachings are very
useful to those who listen to them, but when he speaks to the Jews, he spreads
a sort of darkness over his words, since they do not listen to them with
attention: this is how these excellent gifts and who bring us salvation, they
often withdraw them when those to whom he has departed do not profit. "The
Prophet and the diviner. It is not a weak sign of anger to see the prophecies
cease. When God hated the Jewish people because of the sins of the children of
Helius and the perversity of the multitude, the prophecy ceased, "The word
of the Lord was precious; we did not know any more vision. (I Kings, III, 1.)
Precious, that is rare. The same thing happened under Ozias; they could have,
if they had wished, removed from this circumstance (the great goods, in fact,
to learn to know the things of God, to guard against future dangers, to learn
from what is obscure, when it will be necessary or attacking the enemies or
resting, how they could chase the evils that overwhelmed them, all this gave
them a great facility in obtaining salvation, but as they did not put into
practice what they had learned, he took away the means of learning it again,
this shows the charity of God, of this God who knows the future, and who knows
how the Jews would use his gifts, granted them nevertheless. With the Prophet
he says he will remove them still the diviner.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Here it seems to me that
he calls soothsayers those men who, through their wisdom and experience, enter
the future. Another thing is the word of the diviner, another thing that of the
Prophet; one speaks inspired by the Holy Spirit and utters nothing from his own
background; the other, taking as a point of departure past events, and having
as its guide only his intelligence, foresees many future events, as it is
natural for an intelligent man to foresee them. But from one to the other there
is a great distance, the whole distance that exists between human intelligence
and divine grace. And in order to make this clearer by an example, let us
represent Solomon and Elisha: both of them made known the hidden things, both
revealed secrets, but not by the same means; one would only be of his intelligence
and judge courtesans from what he knew of nature; the other without having
recourse to reasoning (and what reasoning could have revealed to him the flight
of Giesi?), enlightened by grace, saw what was happening far from him: -
"The old man and the chief of fifty men. Then he adds that he will also
remove the old men and the heads of fifty men. By old men it does not mean
simply those who have reached advanced age, but those with white hair unite the
wisdom that suits white hair. And speaking of the chief of fifty men, he does
not only designate the chiefs of fifty men, but the chiefs whoever they may be.
There is nothing, nothing more terrible than anarchy, as there is nothing more
dangerous than an unmanned ship. And without stopping, he threatens them again
to take from them a last protection, the men of good advice, who are not less
useful to the States than the refined ones. "I will remove," he says,
"those admirable sages who give good advice and the expert
architects," not those who build houses, but those who have business
experience, a vast science, and who could administer the business. State with
intelligence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. And with those,
"The wise listener. If this alone is wanting, even in the midst of the
abundance of all the others, the cities will derive no advantage from it; that
there are prophets, counselors, powerful, if there are no hearers, all will be
vain and useless. And here this word I will remove seems to me to mean I will
leave, I will give up, as Saint Paul says: "He delivered them to a reprobate
meaning (Romans 1, 28)," not that he precipitated them into madness but he
left them and abandoned them in the madness where they were. "I will give
them young men for princes. Here is worse and more unfortunate than anarchy. He
who has no leader is deprived of a driver; but he who has a bad one has only
one conductor who will precipitate him into the abyss. (361) If he says:
"Young people," it is not to scorn the youth, but to better show the
folly of these leaders. Certainly we see wise young men, as well as foolish old
men; but because this is rarely done, and the opposite happens much more often,
he uses this name to designate fools. Timothy, still young, ruled churches with
more wisdom than thousands of old men had done; Solomon, who was only twelve
years old, spoke to God, enjoyed great credit, was proclaimed and crowned king,
admired for his wisdom even the barbarians who came to contemplate him, not
only men, but also women who had come running. from afar, whose journey had
only this purpose, to hear and learn something from his mouth; then, grown old,
lost much of his virtue. And his father, Blessed David, did not commit this
disastrous crime either in his childhood or in his youth; he had passed that
age when he sinned. He was still a little child when he won this admirable
victory, that he overthrew the barbarian, that he showed so much wisdom, and
his youth did not prevent his beautiful actions. And when Jeremiah wished to
apologize because of his age, God does not admit this reason; but he sent him
to the Jewish people, and told him that his youth would not be an obstacle to
him, provided he were endowed with firmness. It is at this age, or rather at a
much more tender age, that Daniel judged the old men. Josiah was not yet twelve
years old when he ascended a royal throne; and at that age he showed himself
wise, but afterwards a negligence which continually worsened corrupted all
virtue in his soul. What about Joseph? Was it not in his youth, and again, in
an extreme youth, that he had to sustain this hard struggle, not against men,
but against the tyranny of nature, and that he came out of the midst of the
flames and a fiery furnace more terrible than the Assyrian furnace, without
having felt anything and as intact as the three children. The bodies of these
had not been damaged, not even their hair, it seemed as if they were coming out
of the water rather than the fire; likewise he who escaped the enemy's Egyptian
hands withdrew without his innocence having suffered either from the touch, from
the words, nor from the sight, nor from the clothes, nor from the perfumes
which light the fire of the passions. a fire more terrible than that of
branches and pitch, nor, finally, of its young age, as it happens too often to
men. And these three young people in their prime of life were able to master
gluttony, to trample under foot the fear of death, to despise so many an army
and a king whose anger was more terrible than these flames, and without
frightening them. they always kept a free soul. It is not therefore to despise
the youth that he speaks thus, for St. Paul, when he says: "Not a
neophyte, lest he be puffed up with pride. in the condemnation of the devil (I
Tim. III, 6), "does not mean to designate a person young as to age, but
planted, that is to say, educated for a short time; for to plant in his
language is to instruct and teach, as when he says: "I planted, Apollo
watered. "(I Corinthians III, 6.) And Christ also calls it planting:"
Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be torn out. If,
however, by the word "Neophyte" he had heard a young man, he would
not have brought up Timothy, still young, so young that he said to him,
"Let no one despise your youth." I would not have raised him to this
dignity, and would not have entrusted him with the care of so many churches.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

dominate them. You see, it's not the young age he despises, but the evil. This
single added word makes his thought clearer. For by scoffers he hears here
deceivers, scoffers, flatterers, all those who finally, by their words, give
themselves up to the devil. "All the people will rush, man against man,
neighbor against neighbor." For just as, when the beams that support a
building are rotten or removed, the walls crumble necessarily since nothing holds
them back any more, so after the disappearance of all those whom the Prophet
has just recalled The chiefs, the councilors, the judges, the prophets, there
will be nothing that prevents the nation from falling into dissolution, from
being delivered to an immense ruin.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

rise up boldly against the old man and the last of the people against the
nobles. The young man, he means, will rise up against the old man, despise him,
scorn him. This is what, even (362) before the arrival of the enemies, is more
terrible than the war. When, in fact, old age is despised by youth, and vile
and abject men trample under foot those who are honored by all, the city where
these things are happening is not in better condition than if it were abandoned
to the omens. . "Everyone will go to his brother or the one who lives all
the same roof as his father, and tell him: you have a garment; be our leader
and live under your rule (6). He will then answer and say, "I will not be
your leader, for there is no bread or clothing in my house. I will not be the
leader of this people (7). Here it seems to me that Isaiah prophesies either a
terrible siege which will reduce the inhabitants to the last extremities, or,
if there is no siege, an intolerable famine, and an almost absolute lack of
necessary things. He used popular language: As many say: If we offered to sell
the whole city for a penny, she would find no buyer, so to show the extreme
misery into which she had fallen, the Prophet says: If one offered to sell
dignities for a garment or a bread, there would be no buyer, so great is the
scarcity of necessary things! "Because Jerusalem falls into
dissolution," 8 that is to say, was abandoned, deserted; the providence of
God has abandoned it. "And Judea falls; It is filled with troubles,
tumult, confusion, and disorder. "And their sinful tongues refuse to obey
the Lord's commands. Here he indicates the cause of their ills, the
intemperance of their language. It is also what Oses reproaches them in these
terms: "Ephraim was; annihilated on the day of his punishment; I made the
tribes of Israel see the truth of my threats. Malachi also says the same thing:
"The prophets blame those who by their words irritate God. And you said:
How did we irritate him? In what you said: All those who do evil are considered
good in the eyes of the Lord and he delights in them. Where is the God of
justice? In this accusation he addresses to them two accusations; it is that
they are not content to disobey and transgress the law; they should blush and
be ashamed, hide and humble themselves; far from it, they add to their first
faults, and after having broken the precepts, they add to their disobedience
impudent words, like a wicked servant who, leaving without fulfilling the
orders of his master, would add to that insolence. "Also in her glory she
was humbled and the confusion of her face testified against them (9). "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He speaks of the future
as of a past, according to the habit of the prophets. He calls captivity the
humiliation of his glory. For it is not a slight humiliation for those who were
counted among the kings of the earth to be enslaved to profane and barbarous
men. Here he means by confusion of the face that which gives rise to sin. That
was their life. As they were the first to be shamed by actions, God, in order
to punish them, deprived them of their glory, thus inducing them to a lesser
punishment than they had inflicted themselves. For they were not ashamed of the
foreign land, as living in their homeland multiplied their iniquities. There
their perversity was repressed: here it was constantly increasing. The Prophet,
therefore, gives them a great lesson when he teaches them not to wait for
retribution to flee vice, to humble themselves and to blush, not when the
barbarians carry them captive, but when the tyranny of sin keeps them enslaved.
. "They have published their sin, as in Sodom, and they have not hidden
it. What I have said often, I repeat again, is to show the divine clemency that
the Prophet announces not what they will suffer, but the punishment they
deserve. Their crimes equaled those of Sodom, but their punishment was much
weaker. The Lord did not destroy them entirely, did not overthrow their city
from top to bottom, did not remove the remnants of their nation. These words: "They
have published, they have not hidden," the Prophet uses it to speak the
language of men. God, indeed, does not wait for the crime to be made to know
him (for does he not know all things before they are made?); but Isaiah speaks
thus to show the greatness of evil.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. Just as Moses said,
"The cry of their iniquity has come up to me" (Gen. xviii. 20),
"it is not that he is relegating God far from men, or shutting him up. in
the sky, but it is because he wants to show greatness (363) their sin; likewise
here, these words: "They have announced," are intended to show the
excess of their malice. In fact, the light sins can escape the knowledge of the
neighbor, while the largest and the most enormous are known and obvious to all,
even if there is no one to be the object of an accusation, of a blame. They
announce themselves, they discover themselves. Also, as the Prophet wants to
show the greatness of the faults here, he says: "They have published, they
have not hidden," as if he were saying: it is with boldness, with
insolence that they have sinned, without shame without disguising anything, but
hurting their study.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"Woe to them,
because they have harmed themselves, saying, Let us chasten the righteous
because he troubles us (10)! It is the height of the misfortune to see not men
who not only sin, who sin with boldness, but also who chase those who could
take them back. Those whom the frenzy carries off, often strike the doctor:
even if sinners show that they are incorrigible, it is above all by expelling
the just. For such is virtue; his sight alone is enough to afflict the wicked.
Such is malice; without even being blamed often, she can not stand the presence
of those who do good. But it is a double crime to chain the right and chained
it as inconvenient. So the Prophet, seeing that they brought iniquity to its
last limits, begins by pitying them, not by accusing them or taking them back,
and he says, "Woe to them! And he skilfully adds "because they hurt
themselves. At first glance, this machination seems to be hatched against the
just; but considering it more carefully, we shall see that it is not the one
who suffers it, but those who do it. Let us learn from this that the just, even
when subjected to a thousand evils, suffers no injury from those who attack him;
but they pierce themselves with a sword, as did the Jews of whom Isaiah speaks.
They did not harm the right while chaining him; but they rushed themselves into
greater darkness, since they rejected the light. "And they will eat the
fruit of their works. For such is wickedness; she finds in herself her
punishment. What he says is this: They will enjoy the fruits of their works,
placing themselves in greater solitude and preparing for more precipices.
"Woe to the impious! he will suffer ills proportionate to the works of his
hands (11). Do you see that we give ourselves the measure and that we ask the
cause of our punishment? So the Prophet again began his complaints, his moans
and tears because the Jews were harming themselves and compromising their
salvation more than their most bitter enemies could have done; and what's more
unfortunate than that? "My people, the exactors rob you (12). It is a good
teacher to bring in his words variety, not to be always irritated, nor to show
any indulgence, but to employ sometimes one, sometimes the other way. so that
variety brings better utility. That is why the Prophet does not always accuse,
but sometimes moans, how to accuse who is all the better, while causing less
pain, and what is astonishing. is that a deeper injury causes less pain. And
not only does he groan, but still he heals, another no less amazing way of
instructing. What is it? Not to blame everyone together, but to separate the
people from their leaders and accumulate accusations on their heads. This means
is so useful that Moses used it very often. Although the charge should fall on
all, yet he directs it only against the chiefs; for Moses, seeing that the
people, above all, were guilty of prevarication, and that Aaron did not deserve
so much blame, leaves out those who were the most guilty, and addresses the one
who was less guilty, leaving to the the conscience of them, the care of judging
themselves by the reproaches of the latter, and of condemning themselves to a
greater punishment; and that's what happened. He no longer needed to speak to
the people; but it is enough for this few words which he addressed to Aaron to
contain, as one man, so great a multitude, and. to bring him so much audacity
to extreme humility and fear. This is what Moses foresaw, and that is why, just
down from the mountain, he throws the tables of the law and shouts to Aaron:
"What did this people do to you so that you made them happy? of his
enemies? (Exodus XXXII, 21.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. The prophet Isaiah
does the same and imitates (364) this saint in two ways. Moses did not just
accuse; he took the outside of a distressed person and so he charged. Isaiah
imitates him in these two things when he says: "My people, the exactors
rob you. He accuses them, and it is to appear to testify to the people of
compassion that he speaks thus. By collectors he. seems to designate usurers;
for me, I would willingly believe that it indicates thieves and miseries, or,
if it is not this sense, the receivers of taxes. Notice here his prudence. It's
not that he blames the thing, but the abuse of it. He does not say, in fact,
demand your good, but rob you, that is to say, rob you of what you have,
deprive you of everything on the pretext of taxes. It is to the reapers that he
borrowed this metaphor. To strip a field completely is to collect after the
harvest the ears that have escaped the workmen; it's leaving nothing on this
field. This is what the tax collectors did, since they removed all the property
and sent the stripped citizens back. "And the recipients dominate over
you. And what is worse is that they have not shown themselves only greedy for
property, but have carried their tyranny further by subjecting free men to
servitude. "My people, those who flatter you are deceiving you. Here
Isaiah seems to me to indicate the false prophets, or those who speak to make
themselves agreeable: what becomes the cause of extreme corruption. Also, to
show how harmful it is, he adds: "They break the path by which you must
walk; That is to say, they do not let you walk straight, because they deflect
you, discourage you, and take away your vigor. "But the Lord is ready to
come to judge you, and it is his people whom he will call to judgment; the Lord
will come to judgment with the elders of his people and their princes. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">He continues to employ
the same kind of accusation, the leader not against the people, but against the
elders and the chiefs and making his word more frightening. On the other hand
it is God whom he shows judging, condemning, and accusing of the evils which
they had done to the people those who harmed him. That is why he says,
"But the Lord is ready to come and judge." As he spoke in vain to
accuse, since he was addressing people who regard the accusation as something
not serious and let it be frightened that by punishment he says that we will
not confine ourselves to accusing, but that a punishment is reserved for sin;
he who condemns, will chastise himself and judge the prevaricators. This shows
us how much God is filled with charity, since he consents to enter into judgment
with them and seeks to confound them, which must certainly cause great pain to
men who have kept their good sense. It is not only for the motive of which I
have spoken so loudly that he speaks to princes and elders, but also to teach
to all that the judgment of the chiefs will be more severe than that of the
subjects. These will answer only for themselves, and they will answer for
themselves and for the people whose direction they have taken; and it is not
without reason that the ancients will be subject to such a rigorous judgment.
Because what authority does in chiefs, age does it in old men. Certainly the
young man who sins gravely deserves punishment; but he to whom age has brought
more cam, who is more besieged to me by furious passions, but for whom it is
easy to live as a sage, and who can abstain from the things of the age, will be
justly punished with more severity if he. shows in old age the same license as
young men. "But why have you set my vineyard on fire, and why are your
houses filled with the remains of the poor? Everywhere God shows the care he
takes of the oppressed, care no less great than when it comes to sins committed
against him; even more, he sometimes punishes more gravely the faults against
the neighbor. Is a woman adulterous, allowing her husband to dismiss her? Is
she unfaithful? He does not allow it, and yet the fault of infidelity is
directed against him, while the other is only directed against a man. If your
sacrifice is ready, he orders you to leave it there and not to offer it until
you are reconciled with your brother, if you have offended him. And when he
judges the one who owed ten thousand talents, after having recalled by how many
faults he had been offended, he does not call him even the meanest, far from it
he immediately reconciles himself with him and remits all his debt to him; but
for the hundred denarii required of his companion, he calls him a wicked
servant, the book of executioners, and, he says, he will not release him until
he has paid all the debt.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

himself received a blow, far from doing anything to the slave who had thus
struck him, he contented himself with replying gently: "If I have spoken
ill, bear witness of evil, but if I have spoken well, why are you hitting me?
When Jeroboam wanted to seize the prophet who reprimanded him, the Lord
paralyzed his hand, teaching us that we must reciprocate him, that is to say
gently endure the insults that we are made and punish with force those that are
directed against God. Also, although in his law he has seconded the love of the
neighbor, he declares him similar to the first, and if he is severe in
demanding one, he is not less obliged to demand the other. . Of the one he
says, "With all your heart and with all your soul; On the other,
"like yourself. XXII, 37, 39.) And on the other hand you can see in many
places how carefully God asks us to give back to others what we owe them. See
here as he presses with force, as he accuses with vehemence, as he resorts to
very harsh words. "But you," he said, "why did you set my
vineyard on fire? What would have been done by some barbarous and cruel
enemies, you have done to your own fellow-citizens. He calls the people his
vineyard, because he has healed and surrounded him with his divine protection.
And, to reinforce the accusation, he does not say: Why did you ruin your fellow
slaves, your neighbor, your brothers; but why did you ruin my property and
dispel it? Then to show what kind of fire it is, he adds: "Why are your
houses filled with the remains of the poor? Hail does not ravage the vines,
just as injustice makes the soul of the unfortunate and the poor that it fills
with a pain more unbearable than death. Theft is always an evil, but especially
when the one who is the object is in the last misery. It is not only to blame
them that he speaks thus, laughing to correct them, by putting before them the
spectacle of theft. For after these words it is the sight of the thing put
before the eyes by a vivid painting which is the most adapted to penetrate a sinner
who would not have lost all feeling. "Why do you oppress my people (15)?
He perseveres in the same charge, saying above my vineyard and here my people.
"Why do you work to confuse the face of the humble? "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

correct, you repel them; those you had to take up, you break them. For while
robbing them, they despised the humble and treated them more shamefully than
slaves, joining pride to greed and losing all prudence by that alone that they
had acquired unjust wealth. To avarice comes the disease of pride, and the more
wealth is accumulated, the more this disease increases. "This is what the
Lord, the Lord, the Lord of hosts says. What armies is it? Angels, archangels,
powers, and thus he raises the hearer from the earth to heaven, makes him think
of his great power, so that struck by this spectacle he produce works of wisdom
and that he sees well that the Divine patience is the effect not of impotence,
but of long-suffering. "This is what the Lord says:" Because the
daughters of Zion boasted, and walked with their heads high, waving and
measuring their footsteps, dragging their tunics as they stomped their feet.
rhythmically. And God will humble the Princesses of Zion and the Lord will
unmask them on this day. And the Lord will make the glory of their garments,
their finery, their braids and their ribbons of head, their croissants, their
necklaces, the ornaments of their faces and the arrangement of an ornament of
glory, their bracelets, their rings, their networks, their rings and their right
arm bracelets, their dangle earrings, their purple dresses, their coats for the
home, their Laconian crêpes, their linen fabrics, their hyacinth-colored
fabrics or their scarlet dotted with gold and precious stones and their summer
garments embellished with gold. And instead of a pleasant fragrance there will
be nothing but dust and you will not gird off a belt, but rush, and your curly
hair disappearing leave only a bald head because of your works and instead of a
purple tunic you will cover yourself with a hair shirt. Such will be the
punishment of your luxury. And the most beautiful of your sons, the one you
love will fall by the sword and the mighty of you will fall by the sword and be
humbled. And the vases where are (366) contained the makeup of which you raise
your beauty will weep and we will leave you alone and you will be stretched on
the ground (16-26). It is an unusual thing that the Prophet did here in
addressing women so long, which we do not notice in any other place in the
Scriptures. What is the cause?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. It seems to me that at
that time the softness of women was great and that they contributed very little
to the malice of men. That is why he addresses them in particular to reproach
them for their great crimes, and when he begins to speak to them, it is still
in the name of God. "This is what the Lord says: Because the daughters of
Zion boasted, and walked with their heads high. The first of the vices he takes
from them is pride and arrogance. Certainly this vice is very serious wherever
it occurs, but especially when it is women who are guilty of it. A haughty
woman, by the very fact that she is lighter and less reasonable, allows herself
to be easily dragged down, submerged herself and sinks, because, like a violent
wind, pride and arrogance precipitate her into the abyss. The Prophet seems to
address the women of Jerusalem; so he says: the daughters of Zion. "They
walked with their heads up. Here he mocks them, showing the pride of women who,
unable to contain this passion in themselves, let her escape from the outside
and make her appear in the attitude of their bodies. And this pride does not
only make them proud, but also unclean; what Isaiah will say and show in what
follows. For he adds: "Making signs of the eyes; It is the characteristic
of women who want to be sought after by turning their eyes here and there, thus
showing their softness and their bad passion: there is no greater index of
sluggishness and impurity. "Measuring their steps and dragging their
tunics. This accusation is serious, though perhaps it does not seem so; it is,
in fact, the mark of extreme corruption, of softness, of impurity, of
dissolution, of dragging one's tunic. This is what a profane writer reproached
his opponent by saying, "Leaving your cloak down to your heels. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

with the foot in rhythm. It is still the same indecency that manifests itself.
For there is nothing, neither the eyes, nor the clothes, nor the feet, nor the
gait, nothing, I say, that can not manifest either virtue or vice. Because the
senses are like the heralds of the soul that lives in us. And just as painters
mixing a few colors draw all the images they want, so do the movements of the
members of our body express themselves outside and render the feelings of the
soul sensitive to the gaze. This is why another wise man says: "The
garment of the man, the laughing of the teeth and his gait make me know who he
is. (Eccl XIX, 27.) "And God will humble the princesses of Zion, and the
Lord will unmask them on this day, and the Lord will make the glory of their
garments disappear. To these two passions, pride and impurity, he contrasts the
two remedies which suit them, with pride, humiliation, and the search for the
beauty of their clothes, their annihilation. A war will come, he says, and
everything will disappear. The haughty and proud women, suddenly struck by
fear, will be delivered from their illness; as for those whom slackness and
disorder corrupted, when they fell under the yoke of servitude, they will be
delivered from their impurity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

gravity and to strike the minds of his listeners, he successively indicates all
these ornaments of women, ornaments for the eyes, ornaments for all the parts
of the body. He then goes to the ornamentation of their houses. For not
satisfied with adorning their bodies, they carried their shameful passion to
adorn the walls, and thus employed their riches in useless expense, they who
curled their hair, wanted to spread everywhere the nets of their coquetry. He
reproaches them by saying that he "will make the glory of their clothes,
their adornments, their braids and their bunches disappear. Their bunches are
either an ornament of the head or the shape affected by the ribbon that held
the hair. "Their croissants": it was an ornament resembling the moon
and placed around the neck. "And their necklaces. Perhaps it means
sickle-shaped ornaments. "And the ornaments of their faces. Here I think
he wants to indicate the makeup and the colors. "And the arrangement of an
ornament of glory," that is, enshrined in gold. "And their
bracelets," the gold jewels that surrounded their arms. "Their
rings," placed (367) around the wrist. "Their golden networks,"
around the head. "Their rings and their bracelets of the right arm,"
those who are called dexiaria. "Their earrings, their purple dresses,
their coats for the house, their pancakes of Laconia." Such was their fury
of libertinage that they were not satisfied with what their country produced,
but that they were going to seek foreign ornaments and that they brought them
from beyond the seas. Because between Palestine and Laconia there is a great
distance, an immense sea.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

reason that he designated the country without indicating the name of the
ornaments to show how much their luxury exceeded the limits. "Their linen
fabrics, their hyacinth and scarlet-colored fabrics, their linen fabrics dotted
with gold and precious stones, and their summer garments embellished with gold.
There is nothing, either in the clothes or in the rest of the toilet, which has
escaped them; they had exhausted all luxury, carried away by this tyrannical
passion for unbridled impurity.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">But if, before the times
of grace and our religion so perfect, these things were already blamed, what
pardon will these women who are called to heaven, to longer fights, to the
imitation of angels, far surpass this license? and even that of the courtesans
of theater? And the sad thing is that they do not believe in sinning. So we
must fight them with the word of the Prophet. It is not only against the Jews,
but against the women of today that this word will be pronounced: "Instead
of a pleasant perfume, there will be nothing but dust. Do you see how he
condemns perfumes and how he announces that this research will be punished? The
dust of which he speaks here is that which was raised by the overthrow of the
city and the incursion of the barbarians. They destroyed the city by iron and
fire, overthrowing some parts and burning others. This is what the Prophet
foretold in these terms: "Instead of a pleasant perfume there will be
nothing but dust and you will not gird a belt, but a rush; Putting before them
the spectacle of captivity and their transmigration into the land of
barbarians. "And your disappearing curly hair will leave only a bald
head," whether their hair fell as a result of this catastrophe, or that
the enemy had cut it, or cut it themselves. For it was once the custom in
mourning and the misfortune of shaving and cutting one's hair. Job, for
instance, had his head shaved when he heard the misfortunes of his children.
And further on, the Prophet says that they will put on a hair-shirt, and that
they will groan while cutting their hair. Another also says, "Pull off
your hair, cut it off entirely to mourn your children who lived in delights.
"And instead of a purple tunic you will cover yourself with a hair
shirt." Are not these things terrible and unbearable? But for us the
punishment will not stop there; the poisoned worm, and the endless darkness
will reach us. These Jews endured captivity, servitude, and extreme evils for
their adornment: for this was the cause of their punishment, and the sin which
God particularly pursued, Isaiah teaches us when he, after this enumeration,
says, indicating the cause: "Such will be the punishment of your luxury.
If, I say, the Jews, for being adorned, suffered such a punishment that they
saw their country overthrown from the ground up, and after having known such
delights they fell into slavery, servitude and exile, that they were taken to a
foreign land, that they perished by famine, pestilence, and a thousand other
kinds of death, do you not see plainly that the same faults will bring us much
more severe chastisements? ? For if we receive greater honors, we will also
receive more severe tortures.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">That if your toilet has
not yet attracted you to these evils, do not be proud of it. For this is what
God usually does: He punishes one or two prevaricators to show others what
plagues await them. And to make clearer what I say, the inhabitants of Sodom
once committed horrible sins; they also suffered a terrible punishment when the
fire of heaven struck them, and their cities, the inhabitants, and the earth
itself were consumed with their bodies. But what? Are there not yet after them
who dared to commit the same sins? Yes, there have been many and all over the
world. Why were they not punished in the same way? Because they are reserved
for another more severe punishment. God has not renewed this punishment so that
those who will have the same audacity, even if they do not suffer the pain here
below, know well that they will not escape. Would it be reasonable indeed that
those who, before the time of grace, of the law, the prophets, sinned, suffer
so much evil, while the sinners who followed them, after being the object of a
so much love without such an example made them wiser, which certainly
aggravates their sin, would avoid the punishment reserved for their faults? Why
have not they been punished yet? To teach you that they are reserved for a much
more terrible punishment. ,</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">10. That there are
punishments more terrible than those of Sodom, Christ teaches us in these
terms: "There will be less to suffer for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for this city. So that the women who are parenting today, if they
do not suffer what the women who were then doing, were no more brothers.
Patience and long-suffering prepare a fiery fire and a greater flame. That's
what happened to Ananie and Saphire. It was at the beginning of this epoch when
the Gospel spread that, guilty of lies, they died immediately, while afterwards
many who committed the same crime suffered nothing. Could one then explain how
a judge so just and who uses the same measure to everyone would punish those
who are less guilty, while he would let out those who have sinned more
seriously? Is it not obvious that, since he has fixed a day when he must judge
the universe, he delays the punishment of the latter only in order that so much
patience makes you better or that, if they persevere in the same faults, are
they all the more terribly punished? Therefore, when after our sins we are not
punished as those who once committed the same faults and suffered from them,
let us not be more tranquil, but on the contrary that our fear increases. It
is, so to speak, the promulgation of a law of God that their punishment: he
warns us all and tells us: I have punished him who sinned from the beginning so
that if you sin after him, you know what wait for you, you convert and become
better. For the same mistakes are reserved the same punishments, although they
do not follow immediately. It is not without reason that I stopped on this
passage: because this frightening evil has penetrated into our houses, thanks
to the softness of women, I mean the refinements of the toilet which increase
the expenses, which precipitate in Inopportune prodigalities, which become
daily the occasion of struggles, discord, lawsuits, which make the poor die of
hunger. Because when the bride forced her husband to spend all his money and
even more for the shame of his body (because this gold shining on them is their
shame), the hand can not open for the alms. And from there many other kinds of
sins; but leave it so that experience will teach it to those who expose
themselves to these evils, and speak of what follows.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">After saying what will be
the captivity and declaring that she came only to punish the unbridled luxury
of his women, he completes the painting of misfortune by saying: "And the
most beautiful of your sons, the one you love, will fall by the sword, and the
mighty of you will fall by the sword. That is more frightening than captivity:
for there are cases where life is harder than death. When, besides captivity,
they will still have to groan over premature deaths, imagine what will be their
misfortune, since an uninterrupted series of evils adds suffering to suffering.
If there were only servitude, it would already be an intolerable evil, and when
such a misfortune happens to men who lived free, it is a life more cure than
death. But behold, he says, the two things will be together. But should we not
say that it is a double, a triple, a quadruple misfortune when it is a son, the
most beautiful of all, the most darling who dies, and that of the hand of the
barbarians and not by the common law of nature? And add that all those of the
same age will perish too; so that they have no hope, as to what concerns at
least the help and assistance of men. "And they will be humiliated. And
the vases where the beauties of which you lift up your beauty are crying, and
you will be left alone and you will lie down on the ground. So many traits
complete this dismal picture, inspire fear, and make anxiety more acute. The
Prophet puts misfortunes before his eyes, he paints the scourges, going everywhere
and collecting the details of this calamity, and this, because of the
insensitivity of the listeners. It would have been (369) desirable that,
touched by these threats, the daughters of Zion had risen up courageously,
anticipating the calamities that were about to melt on them. And so, he adds
(which must certainly make them understand their misfortune), that they will
see the golden vases, a remembrance of their former prosperity, so that this
sight may come to remind them of their misfortune. For misfortunes make us feel
especially their sting when we compare them with our former happiness, and this
comparison makes the wound deeper. This is what Job once said in his pains:
"Who will give me to be as in the days of old? (Job, XXIX, 2.) And he enumerates
all his riches, the goods that flowed to him from all sides, honors, revenues,
all the brilliancy he enjoyed, so that this comparison shows better the gravity
of the misfortunes that overwhelm him. This is what the Prophet does when he
speaks of these vessels, and not content to talk about them, he adds that they
are crying. Nothing is more eloquent than a way of speaking that personifies
inanimate objects. Already he makes the vines and the wine groan, to better
touch his listeners and sting their insensibility. What to say: "We will
leave you alone? "You will be deprived," he said, "of the
assistance of your allies, and of the benevolence of God, deprived of all your
splendor, surrounded on all sides by your enemies, encircled in the midst of
barbarians. Then, to show the excess of his humiliation, he says: "And you
will lie on the ground. He does not say, You will fall, neither, You will be
hasty, but it is a term much more apt to show the full extent of his
humiliation that he has resorted to.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

threat of misfortune, having sufficiently represented their misfortunes, and at
length detailed these terrible evils, he now comes to speak of better things.
It is a good doctor not only to cut and burn, but also to soften by suitable
remedies the pains that these operations have caused: this is what Isaiah does.
He does not say that all this history will lead to a sad denouement, but that
when the evils are gone, the goods will come in their turn; and not only will
the evils cease, but great glory and great glory will surround the survivors of
Israel. This is what he means by "the Lord will shine," his light
will make the darkness of sorrow disappear; bring back the day in all its
splendor, and render the Jews illustrious. These words "in the
council" show us that he will do it with intelligence, with the wisdom
that suits him "Then all those who will remain in Zion and remain in

midst of danger, he says, "They will be called all those who have been

have been separated, chosen, marked to suffer no harm. It is not without reason
that he calls them saints, he wants to show that what saved them is not simply
the choice that was made of them, nor simply the will of God, but also their
virtue, that which preceded, or that which was to follow these calamities.
Although some were already good and virtuous, nevertheless these events were to
render them better and more vigilant. For just as the gold thrown into the fire
loses all defilement, so the righteous become more righteous in the trials,
because they leave there all that could remain to them lukewarm. "Because

indicate here a double purification: first they will be punished for their
sins, and then this punishment will make them more perfect for the future. I
call Jerusalem blood, killings, unjust killings. Then, to make the accusation
worse, he said, "Who is in their midst? For it was not in secret that they
shed blood, but they cruelly exceeded the brigands, and those who lay their
ambush on the highways. They choose for their packages the darkness of the
night and a deserted place; but they committed their iniquities in the public
squares, in the middle of the city, in the tribunals themselves. But this
defilement, he says, war will remove it. In the time of prosperity he justifies
the past misfortunes, sent, he says, to wash, to purify, to burn and to remove
all stain, to relieve them of the shame they felt for so many faults and
murders. But what do these words mean: "By a spirit of justice and a
spirit of ardor? He continues the metaphor of metals subject to the action of
fire. Just as in this operation the air entering the crucible with great force
excites the flame, gives to the coals more activity, and thus removes all filth
from the metals; In the same way the divine wrath and the incursion of the
enemies was for the city like a fire, not like a fire which makes perish, but a
fire which burns, which purifies, which chastens, which corrects. Because these
words: "spirit of justice," mean spirit of punishment, punishment,
revenge. - "And the Lord will come. By his presence, he hears his action.

cloud is that well-being that comes from the cessation of evils; by fire he
hears the presence of God and the consolation that he will bring. Indeed, what
is a cloud in the heat, a brilliant fire is in the shadow and darkness of a
deep night. One makes the heat disappear, the other the darkness. So the
Prophet likens the glory of God to the brightness of fire and the cessation of
evils in the shadow of a cloud. Then to show that it is not gradually and as
the evils disappear, but that this change will take place suddenly, at the
moment when the dangers will be most pressing, so that this circumstance even

frightened the Jews with the threat of dreadful misfortunes, rejoiced by the
announcement of great goods, and treated them with various treatments, the
Prophet resumes his speech, and this in a way that resembles beginning of the
prophecy. As in this beginning, he recalled the blessings of God to them,
saying, "I have begotten sons, and have brought them up; And putting
before them the iniquities they dared to commit, he adds. "They have
despised me; And again: "Israel did not know me, and my people did not
understand me; Likewise here, in different terms, it is true, but with
identical thoughts, Isaiah shows us the same thing as first. But why, since he
is about to accuse, does he call his accusation? Moses was right in giving this
name to the song he had composted; with Mary, since it was a song of victory;
he was right to begin with these words: "Let us sing a hymn to the Lord,
because he has burst forth his greatness and glory by throwing the horse and
the rider into the sea. Exodus XV, 1.) And Deborah, after this marvelous
victory and this unexpected triumph, was right to make this song of triumph
heard, and to bring back to God all the glory. (Jug V.) But Isaiah is going to
accuse, office which calls for a vehement language, a firm and severe tone, and
yet he announces to us that he is going to sing, and he cries his reproaches.
But he is not the only one to act thus: Moses, the great Moses, who had
composed a triumphal canticle, also composed, to quote the Jews, this long song
filled with reproaches, where it is said: "Is this what do you render to
the Lord? This people is mad and foolish (Deut, XXXII, 6); Then he accumulated
the accusations and ordered the people to sing him, and we too are still
singing him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Why do they have with
reproach composed a hymn? In this they showed spiritual wisdom, and they wanted
to bring great good to the souls of their hearers. For as there is nothing so
useful as the continual memory of one's sins, and that nothing produces a
memory as lasting as singing, wanting to avoid that accusations all too often
repeated would discourage the Jews and keep them from running away. the continual
memory of their iniquities, the Prophet disguised the shame of this memory
under the hymn; to soften the pain that they could not have endured, he
composed hymns so that forced by their desire to sing, forced, I say, to repeat
them incessantly, they recollect them incessantly and that the memory their
continual sins were to them like a continual lesson in virtue. You know that
(372) most men do not even know the rest of the holy books by name, while all
are constantly mouthing the book of psalms and canticles we are betting: so the
experience itself shows us how much the songs are useful. This is why the
Prophet says here: "I will sing to my beloved vine the song of my beloved.
To my beloved vine the song, "I will sing about my beloved. I will sing
for him, he says, and I will take for my songs or himself or what relates to
him. How is it that, on the point of accusing this people, he calls it a dear
and beloved vine? Do not be surprised. Admittedly, he can not begin with a more
serious charge than to reproach them for not having become better, after having
received from God so many marks of affection. This is what another prophet says
in these words: "I have found Israel as bunches of grapes in the
wilderness and their fathers as the first figs on a fig tree (Hosea, IX, 10);
He indicates by the choice of these fruits how good they are, and filled with
good qualities, not, no doubt, by their own virtue, but by the goodness of God.
What he says is here in other words: I loved him, as one who finds a bunch of grapes
in the desert, or a fig of first fruits on a fig tree. These comparisons, it is
true, are not worthy of God, but they are well suited to their greed. "And
for them," he adds, "for them whom he pursued with so much love, they
turned away from him and found Beelphégor. It is in these terms that he
addresses this beloved and beloved people, pointing out to the Jews that God
did everything for them, even though they had not started first, God having
warned them still. And far from showing themselves worthy of this benefit,
their works have shown only their ingratitude. "My beloved had a vine
planted as on a horn, in a fertile place. By this word of vine he shows all his
solicitude and care for them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. And without stopping
there, he enumerates all the blessings with which they have fulfilled them; he
begins by indicating the choice of place: "As on a horn, in a fertile
place," indicating by the second word the nature of the ground and by the
first its position; it is also what David in his Psalms says of Jerusalem:
"Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains and the Lord is around his people.
"(Ps. CXXIV, 2.) he strengthened it, he means, by the very choice of the
place, but, without being satisfied with this, he became himself his main
defense: he indicates in fact by this word, as on a horn, that this place is
impregnable; but what is most remarkable is that it indicates divine protection
by the metaphor it uses, a metaphor borrowed from the horn of an ox. It is a
proverb commonly used when speaking of those who have taken refuge in a safe
place. As indeed the bull is the strongest of the animals and in him the
strongest part is the horn, which it uses like a weapon, many use this figure,
and the Scripture often designates by keras monokerotos, those who are safe.
These words: "On a horn" signify, in safety, in a high place: what
amounts to what is said in the first chapter: "I begot sons and I raised
them. "" In a fertile place, "or as Moses says," in a land
where milk and honey flow. (Exod III, 8.) "I have surrounded her with a
hedge and a palisade. The hedge is either a rampart, or the law, or Providence;
for the law was for them the strongest of the walls. "I have surrounded
her with a palisade," that is to say, I have given her an assured rampart;
for, as it is often easy to cross the wall of a city, I have surrounded them,
he says, with another means of defense. "And I planted it with sorec. He
continues his metaphor, which we must not interpret word for word, but of which
we must content ourselves with seeing the goal. By sorec it means here a vine
frank and good breed, whose plant is chosen, tried and of excellent quality,
because there are many kinds of vines. "I built a tower and made a press
in the middle. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Some of them mean the
temple and the winepress, the sanctuary, because there were gathered the fruits
of the virtue of each one, the offerings and all the sacrifices; for me, as I
have already said, and repeat it again, I only attach myself to the object of
allegory. By all these details he wants to hear only one thing; he has filled
them with all his benefits, and has shown them, in all things, his love. I did
not crush them with work, I did not overwhelm them with fatigue, I did not
build them, or dig the earth, or plant; On the contrary, I delivered them the
completed work. And her charity was not limited to that, but "I waited for
her to produce grapes," and I waited patiently for the time when she would
bear fruit. I used patience, this word: "I waited" the mark enough.
"She only worn thorns. He shows their life sterile, desolate and without
virtue. What indulgence will they be worthy of those who are cultivated with so
much care to give only these fruits? "And now, man of Judah and
inhabitants of Jerusalem, be judges between me and my vineyard." One must
have a well-assured right to establish the guilty same judges of what they have
done. " And now; I do not speak of old things, it is today that I am ready
to submit to your judgment, for I do not cease to fill you with blessings, and
you never fulfill your duties. "What more will I do to my vineyard? For I
have waited for her to produce grapes, and she has produced only thorns. The
construction of this sentence may seem a little obscure: so it must be made
clearer. This is what he means: What should I do that I did not do? That is to
say, what motive did I give them to sin thus? What can they pretend? Can they
claim that they sinned because they were forgotten in certain things?
"What more will I do to my vineyard than I have done? What I did, here he
is, he says; however, I am not content with the testimony of facts, or even
with that of my speech; but if I have not done all that was to be done, I ask
you to tell me, I make you judges you who have enjoyed these benefits, you who
are witnesses, you who have known them by experience, you who are not strangers
and for whom they are not unknown things. - "Now therefore I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard (5). As he has won, won his cause, and
demonstrated their ingratitude, he now carries his sentence, he says what he
will do, not just to condemn them, but so that the fear of these threats will
make them more moderate. "I will pull out the hedge and it will be exposed
to looting; I will destroy her wall and she will be trampled underfoot. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. I will deprive it of
my help, of my help, I will not grant them my benevolence any more, and the
experience of the contrary will teach them what goods they formerly enjoyed;
they will know it when they are exposed to looting. - "I will give up my
vineyard; it will neither be pruned nor plowed. "6 I repeat that he uses
the same metaphor. However, by looking more carefully, we see that he speaks of
doctrine and commandments. They will no longer enjoy the same goods as before,
they will have no more doctors, leaders, prophets to correct them and take care
of them. For as those who tend a vineyard dig, cut, so those who direct souls
threaten, frighten, teach, accuse; but, he says, they will be deprived of all
this, transported to a foreign land. "And the brambles will cover it like
an abandoned land, and I will command the clouds not to pour out their rain on
it." He wants to indicate either the desolation of the city, or the
abandonment where they will be, where will their soul to each; by the clouds
some hear the prophets who bring the rain from above and transmit to the people
what has been revealed to them. But these, he says, will no longer fulfill
their usual ministry. If there were one or two who accompanied them in their
exile, at least the crowd of prophets was silent.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"The vineyard of the
Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant that
is his delight. I waited for Israel to do righteous deeds, and did iniquity;
instead of righteousness, he produced only blatant injustice. "7 As these
names present many metaphors, vines, towers, press, hedge, furrow, size of the
vine, for fear that some insane From that time it did not seem that it was
indeed a vineyard, the Prophet was careful to give at the end the
interpretation of everything. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the
house of Israel." I do not speak of plants, he means, of an inanimate
creature, of stones, of walls, but of our people. That's why he added,
"And the men of Judah are the plant that is his delight; For Judah
surpassed the ten tribes; the temple and all that was used for worship was
there; he flourished more than the rest of Israel, and this tribe was more
royal and more powerful. He used the word "which is his delight" to
reproach them, for what they showed to the one who loved them so much. (374)
Indeed, when people love each other, they can not, even in reproaches, hide the
excess of their love. This makes us discover a second teaching that is not to
be disdained. What is it? It is to know when and where the places of Scripture
can be used for allegorical interpretation; that it is not in our power to
regulate this manner to our liking, that it is necessary above all to attach
ourselves to the very thought of the Scriptures, and to use allegorical
interpretation only as far as we shall be authorized by the sacred text itself.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What I mean, here it is.
Scripture uses the terms vine, hedge, press; and, instead of letting the
listener free to apply these figures to things or persons he would like, she
herself indicates in advance the interpretation, saying, "The vine"
of the Lord of armies, c is the house of Israel. When Ezekiel speaks of a huge
eagle, with large wings, which goes to Lebanon and removes the end of the
branches of a cedar (Ezek XVII, 3), it does not leave the listener the care to
interpret this allegory, but he himself indicates what he means by this eagle
and this cedar. Our prophet, a little further, speaks of a river that spreads
violently over Judea, and not wishing to allow everyone the freedom to apply this
figure as he pleases to whom he would like, he declares who is king that he
designates by this river. And such is the constant practice of the Holy
Scriptures, that to allegory is joined his interpretation, lest the unordered
imagination of the researchers of allegory not go at all and without motive to
go astray and rush to adventure. And do you wonder if the prophets did it, when
the author of the Proverbs did not do otherwise? After saying, "A dear
doe, a way of delights be with you; that the source of this water is for you
alone (Prov.V, 19), "he indicates to whom these words apply, to a
legitimate and free wife, and not to a woman of fornication, to adultery. In
the same way Isaiah declares here who this vine represents. Then after having
recalled the crimes, he announces the punishment; and at the end he says again
to explain his conduct: "I have waited for them to do righteous deeds, and
I see nothing but iniquity, and they bring forth fruits of righteousness, and
they only produce blatant injustice. . It is with justice, he means, that I
will punish them. For I have waited for them to do righteous deeds, that is to
say, full of equity; and they have produced only the opposite, ungodliness,
injustice, glaring iniquities. Through these glaring iniquities, he hears the
passion of riches, unjust anger, senseless fury, struggles, disputes. "Woe
to those who join house to house, who add down to earth, to take something away
from their neighbor (8)! After having said that they are guilty of gross iniquities
by the passion of riches, he indicates a sort of sin which contains a monstrous
iniquity. And he begins again his groans, to show how great are their faults
and incurable their diseases.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. These crimes, we now
see them committed by those who abuse their wealth, who want to seize the
possessions of their neighbors, not to put themselves in safety, but to harm
others and who, like an invading fire , ruin all their neighbors. "Will
you live alone on the earth? All this has gone up to the ears of the Lord of
hosts. Which means that their efforts will be in vain, useless and without
result. As punishment and scourges are less apt to convert these sinners than
to know that they will not enjoy their plunder, the Prophet addresses this
threat to them and tells them that they work, that they make themselves
unhappy. that they accumulate injustice on injustice, but that the enjoyment of
their crimes will be delighted to them. Because, he means, this eye that does
not know sleep will not close on their mistakes. This word "ascended"
does not indicate that crimes have just been revealed to God, but although the
punishment is near, they will receive their reward. "If they have many
houses, all great and beautiful they will be, they will become deserted,
without a single man living there. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">This is the effect of the
passion to amass; when it brings new wealth, it neglects the former. This is
what Isaiah says by saying: When you raise splendid buildings and you acquire
the goods of others, you will lose yours. They will be standing, those houses
that no one will inhabit, but which will so clearly accuse the captors, for
their very solitude, so great and so prolonged, will be like a monument to
their sin. "For ten acres of vines shall scarcely fill a small vessel of wine;
and he that sows six measures shall gather only three. From the desolation of
the city it passes to that of the countryside, in order to make on the listener
more impression. Because, he says, the houses will have lost their inhabitants,
and the earth its productive force. In the beginning, as punishment for Adam's
sin, she bore brambles and thorns, and then, because of Cain's crime, she only
gave products disproportionate to the culture she received and the native
fertility that remained. There are many other circumstances in which one can
see the earth chastised by the crimes of men. And why do you wonder that the
iniquity of men prevents its fertility and fertility, when you know that by us
it has become corruptible and that by us it will become incorruptible? Because
since it exists only because of us and to serve us, the modifications of its
existence also come from the same principle.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The same thing happened
under Noah. When the malice of men came to an end, everything was corrupted,
seeds, plants, animals, earth, sea, air, mountains, forests, hills, cities,
ramparts, houses, towers, and everything was covered by this terrible deluge. .
And when the human race had to multiply again, the earth returned to the old
order and recovered its first beauty. All these events took place because of
men, as it is easy to see. Caria mer withdrew and it appeared afterwards, the
sun and the moon stopped and left their usual course, the fire received the
same properties as the water, the earth that the sea, the sea that the earth;
finally, everything, to put it in a nutshell, is transformed to accommodate the
needs of man. So, since man is more precious than all the rest, and everything
exists only for him, today the Jewish people have sinned, God stops the
fertility of the earth, and, in spite of the fatigues and the reiterated works,
he does not let not his entrails give their usual product, so that we know that
it is not the art of culture, nor the oxen and the plow, nor anything like it,
but the Master of all these things that spreads the goods with a liberal hand
and who, when he wants it, stops the course of these largesses. - "Woe to
those who get up in the morning to run after the palm wine and stay until the
evening, so that the wine warms them! The lute and the harp, the flutes and the
drums do not miss in their orgies; but they have no regard for the shadow of
the Lord, and they do not consider the works of his hands (11 and 12). "By
reproaching them for their pride, he indicates the source of the evil. It is
drunkenness, the mother of a thousand evils, especially when it is audaciously
carried to such an excess.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. See how carefully he
makes his reproaches. It's all day, he says, that they use that. It is not only
during the necessary meals that they do it; but all hours are for them an hour
of drunkenness; from the beginning of the day, especially when they should make
a return on themselves, they abandon themselves to wine, and whether they want
it or do not want it, they stay until the evening riveted to this chain. As for
once they have sunk themselves into the abyss of drunkenness, that they have
lost their reason, that they have reduced their souls under the hard slavery of
this passion, like a ship without ballast, deprived of a pilot and sailors, who
wander here and there, that the current of water carries everywhere, the gulf
of drunkenness engulfs them. This is why the Prophet said, "Woe to those
who get up in the morning to run after the palm wine!" They did not
satisfy a need, they did not wait for the necessity to be felt, but it was
their only business and their occupation is to get drunk all the time. That's
why he says, "To run after the palm wine. Palm wine is the juice that is
extracted from the fruit of this tree, by crushing and pounding it, which has
the nature of wine. It is soporific and produces drunkenness. But without
paying attention to any of this, they continued their pleasure and stayed until
evening. "So that the wine warms them up. Such is the nature of
drunkenness; the more satisfied it is, the more it increases, and the thirst it
produces is difficult to bear. Then he addresses to them a second accusation
which is not less than the first. "The lute and the harp, the flutes and
the drums do not miss in their orgies. This is what another prophet reproaches
them in these terms: "You drink the purified wine, you perfume the most
precious oils, you give your voices with the sound of the musical instruments.
You look at this life as (376) stable and as not finishing. It is the mark of
extreme madness and a soul without vigor to make his house a theater and to
engage in such songs. If drunkenness darkens, the music weakens the vigor of
the spirit, it breaks the strength of the soul and the door to the last
iniquities.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"They have no regard
for the work of the Lord and they do not consider the works of his hands. He
means by that or his miracles or the spectacle of nature. How could they
contemplate him, who make day by day, and who at night look like corpses? How
could they see the sunrise, the dazzling beauty of the sky, the variety - the
stars shining in the evening, the order and subordination that reigns in all
creation, they who have lost the external sight and turns it interior? It is
therefore a great crime that they have committed to spend their lives without
contemplating the wonders that God has produced, and to consume their time in
the darkness of drunkenness. "My people have become slaves because they
have not known the Lord (13). He speaks of the future as a past and announces
the punishment of this crime. Drunkenness alone can already be a link of
punishment, since it fills the soul with trouble, and the intelligence of
darkness, makes it captive, causes it a thousand diseases and inside and out.
Paul knew that malice alone is a punishment; This is why he says, "Thus
receiving in themselves the reward due to their misguidance. But as their
insensibility was brought to this point that they were punished and did not
feel it, they were sick and did not know it, he adds the threat of corporal
punishment: "My people were taken captive because they did not know the
Lord. And a crowd of men died from hunger and lack of water. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

order of his threats is a warning, and that he does not inflict (the most
serious retribution): it is not captivity that punishes them first, but hunger
and thirst. so that they stay at home by becoming better and that their
incorrigible vices do not attract the army of barbarians.But since they have
not given in and they have not taken advantage of this delay, it inflicts them
and lastly, before coming to this point, he depicts in vivid and energetic
terms the torment of hunger: "Hell," he says, "has enlarged his
soul;" He has a soul, but the Prophet uses a prosopopoeia to threaten
better, he wants to make his word expressive and throw a strong fear in the
minds of the listeners, so he adds for the same purpose: "And he opened
his mouth for not to close it again, "as if he were talking about some
monster and he put before them the punishment that awaited them. It is serious
that he does not content himself with opening his mouth, but that he always
holds it gaping, without being satiated everywhere what falls into it.
"And all will come down there, illustrious, great, rich, those who are the
plague of Israel." - And to teach us that it is not the course of nature
that will bring this event, but that this scourge will come from God, that this
punishment will be sent by the sky, the Prophet announces that he will reach
the illustrious, the powerful, those who upset everything, who throw confusion
into the Jewish nation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

event, he himself will fall and be captive. "The man will be humbled, the
great will be despised and the eyes of the superb will be lowered. And alone,
the Lord of armies will be glorified by this judgment (15, 16). See again how
God seeks their good. He does not seek their complete ruin, he does not want
all the people to perish, but he leaves some, so that the sight of the
punishment of those who have been exterminated makes them better. This is what
he gives to hear by saying: "The man will be humbled," that is to
say, the one who will remain, who will remain. "And the Lord of hosts
shall be glorified by this judgment, and the holy God shall be glorified in
righteousness. He indicates two things which will result from it, namely, that
men will shed their pride and become better, and that God will be a subject of
admiration for all; for if he is "exalted and glorified," it will be
by this punishment, by this punishment. What does this word mean by (377) this
judgment? That is to say, by this vengeance.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

scattered like bullocks, and the lambs shall feed in the deserts they have

immense desolation of the country. "Woe to you who pull down your
wickedness like a rope, and as with a belt your sins; who say, "Coming
soon, what God must do, that we may see him; that the projects of the saint of
Israel are realized so that we know them (18, 19). The prophets, in vain,
threatened and predicted terrible things, but the false prophets who spoke only
to be agreeable, and who deprived the people of all energy, said that they were
deceiving, and that they themselves were alone in the truth. . Many, seduced by
lies, did not believe. Besides, the prophecies not being realized at the moment
when they were announced, since the proper of the prophecy is. to announce the
events long beforehand, as the prophets continually threatened famines,
pestilences, wars, without ever being able to show them, many took the
opportunity not to milk and said: Vienna what you announce; if you say: true,
that your words are fulfilled; show us in actual events the will of God. Then
that they had divine patience a pretext not to believe and that their sins they
added two others, first incredulity, then the indifference that brought this
unbelief, it is with The reason is that the Prophet moaned on them, saying: You
draw the wrath of God on you, and you aggravate your malice. Since you do not
believe our words, you only have to stand the test of events. So it is you who
draws evils, refusing to believe our words. This is why he says: "Woe to
you who pull your iniquities like a rope! That is to say, the punishment of
your iniquities. You draw from afar, he means, as with a rope, the punishment
which your sins have deserved, as with the strap which fixes a heifer under the
yoke, thus marking the zeal and the ardor which they put to sin. You are like the
one dragging a burden by means of a strong belt, and so by your unbelief you
draw on you the wrath of God. He then indicates how they attract him:
"Soon comes what God has to do, so that we may see him! This is what
another prophet reproaches them in these terms: "Woe to you who desire to
see the day of the Lord. What will it serve you for today? There is only
darkness without light, darkness without clarity. These unbelievers also said,
"When will the day of retribution and vengeance come?" (Amos, V, 18,
19). Woe to you who call evil good and good evil, which turn light into
darkness and darkness into light, which turn sweetness into bitterness and
bitterness into sweetness (20). It's always the same thought. After accusing
them of insulting and misleading prophets, of honoring the false prophets and
of overthrowing the order of things, he still calls them unhappy because their
judgments are corrupt. "Woe to you who call evil good (he means by that
the words of the false prophets), and good evil (the words of the prophets),
who change the light into darkness and darkness into light, which turn
sweetness into bitterness and bitterness smoothly! The words of the prophets
are hard, it is true, but there is nothing sweeter than them, since their
threats must divert the unpleasant events. The words of the false prophets are
sweet: but there is nothing more bitter than them, since these pleasing words
will bring about too real punishments.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. See how wisely the
Prophet showed the falsity of their judgments. As they moved away from some,
because their words were harsh and they drew nearer to others, because they
showed more gentleness and complacency, he makes them see that it is quite the
opposite, that the prophets have only sweetness and false prophets only bitterness.
We will also reason about light and darkness. Some led to error, others to
truth; some, binding them, so to speak, their hands, delivered them chained to
the obscurity of slavery; the others did nothing to bring them to the light of
your freedom. Since, therefore, the Jews had a false and unfavorable opinion of
them, he rightly reproves them by saying: "Woe to those who make light
darkness and darkness light! (378) Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
and cautious before themselves (21)! It is not a slight fault to think oneself
wise and not to be able to contain one's thoughts. This is where he comes from
what he reproaches, I mean to call evil good and bad good, etc. It is also what
Paul reproaches to the profane philosophers "By saying themselves wise,
they became crazy. And the Proverbs say again, "I have seen a man who
thinks he is wise; there is more to hope from him who has no sense. This is
what Paul recalls again in these terms: "Do not be wise in your own eyes
(Romans XII, 16); And again: "If any one of you seems wise according to
this century, let him become mad to be wise. (I Corinthians III, 18.) That he
does not confide, he means, to his own wisdom or his own thoughts, but that he
rejects them and that he delivers his soul to the lessons of the 'Holy Spirit.
Then, then, that there were among the Jews men who despised the prophets,
because they were shepherds and goatherds, men who wanted to draw their wisdom
only from themselves, an obvious sign of their folly, and who rejected the prophetic
word, it is with reason that Isaiah moaned on them, saying, "Woe to those
who are prudent in themselves and wise in their own eyes! Woe to those of you
who are strong and drink wine, who are powerful and drunk with palm wine (22).</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Do not be surprised if
after having talked so much about the drunkenness a little higher, it comes
back again on the same subject. Because this wound is serious and difficult to
close, it must be washed often. It is serious and difficult to close, because
most do not regard it as a sin, although it is the most serious of all sins,
and that it leads to a thousand disorders. That's why he says, "Who drink
wine, who are powerful and who drank palm wine. It is a double danger that the
tyranny of drunkenness and the excess of power, All men need to keep their
presence of mind, but especially those who are clothed with dignities and great
power. so as not to be carried into the precipice by the weight of their
charge, as by an irresistible stream of furious waters. "Which, for presents,
justify the ungodly and who delight his own justice." It is a double crime
to absolve the guilty and to condemn the innocent, and this double crime comes
from the same origin, the present. "Therefore, as the straw is consumed by
fire, and is devoured by the burning flame ..." The punishment will be
prompt and the revenge easy; this image shows that their ruin will be complete.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">8. That's what fire and
flame, and straw, and everything else mean. "Their root will be reduced to
ashes and their flowers will fall like dust. F that which is firmly fixed will
perish, what is brilliant will be withered, what is beautiful will pass and
flow. "For they did not obey the law of the Lord of hosts, and were
indignant with the word of the holy of Israel. This word is the law. "And
the Lord of hosts was angry with his people; he laid his hand against them, and
he struck them; he was angry with the mountains, and their corpses were thrown
like dung in the middle of the road. And all this has not satisfied his wrath,
"but his arm is still lifted up." (25) The Prophet thus indicates a
terrible war in which they will not be allowed to bury corpses, not that God
wants revenge on the dead, but so that the punishment of others teach the
living to correct itself. And see how this language is severe. He does not say
that they will be deprived of burial, but that the dead will be cast with more
contempt than manure, which is for the living the most terrible spectacle, even
more terrible than death. But what is more serious is that all these
punishments did not make them better and that they persevered in the same
conduct., Then that they did not become better, it threatens them again the
most serious plague, barbarians. This is why he adds: "Therefore he will
lift up his standard among the nations far away." (26) For fear that the
length of the road will leave the culprits in their indifference, he adds that
God will bring the barbarians so easily that he who, raising the standard, is
immediately followed by armed and equipped people; it is the same for horses
trained in battle. As soon as the standard is raised for departure, they rush
out of the gates. The Prophet, therefore, makes two things sound, that it is
easy for the barbarians to come to the call of God, and that they would long
ago have come (379), had his long patience not kept them.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Then he goes on and shows
them that it is easier still: "With a whistle he will call them ends of
the earth. Do not be surprised if, speaking of God, he uses such gross words;
he proportionates his language to the stupidity of the hearers, and wants only
one thing, to make them understand that it is easy for God and that they will
not escape punishment; so he adds: "And immediately these nations will
come with speed; they will not feel hunger or fatigue; they will not sleep.
This language is hyperbolic. How could these strangers escape hunger and sleep,
since they were men, and subject to the common miseries of our nature? But, as
I have said above, he wishes by all these details only to show the promptitude
of the invading army, its facility, its rapidity. They will not leave the
harnesses with which their loins are girded and the cords of their shoes will
not break. Their arrows are sharp and their bows still tense. The feet of their
horses are as hard as the rock and the wheels of their tanks as fast as the
storm. They rush like lions and present themselves as lion cubs. They will
seize their prey by shouting like a ferocious beast, and will carry it away
without anyone else taking it away. In that day they will leap upon Israel with
cries similar to the rustling of the waves of the sea. They will cast their
eyes upward to the sky, down to the earth, and there will be only deep darkness
in their desolation (27-30.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The Prophet uses all
these details to make his language more imposing, and the terror stronger, by
successively traversing each part, first the resolution, then the force, the
arms, the horses, the chariots; he wishes by this long enumeration to print a
deeper fear, and by these striking images put the thing under the eyes. So he
compares the invaders to lions, and without stopping there he makes the roar
heard, shows the anger of the monster; he continues the metaphor and uses only
figures. From there he passes to the sea, saying that there will be a noise, a
tumult, as when the sea is furious and its waves are raised; in a word, he
resorts to everything to increase the fear and make these fatal events avoided.
And what is most unfortunate is that these unfortunate people will find no help
either on earth or in heaven, but deprived of any help from above, any help
from below, they will fall prey to their enemies. Their misfortune will be a
frightful darkness for them, not that the sun disappears in their eyes, but
because at midday their disposition of mind makes them find darkness instead of
light: effect that affection and pain produce often in us. And to teach you
that this darkness comes, not from the air, but from the mindset of the Jews,
the Prophet adds: "Deep darkness in their anguish. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">1. Why does the Prophet,
who ordinarily designates armies, speak of the life of kings, despatch it by
the death of Uzziah? For he does not say, "It happened during the life of
Uzziah," nor "under the reign of Uzziah," but "when he
died." Why does he do this in this place? It is not without reason or
motive, but by a hidden design. What is it? This Uzziah, whom his good fortune
had exalted, which his prosperity had intoxicated, had become too proud.
Because he was king, he thought he could sacrifice, he threw himself into the
temple, entered the holy of holies, and although the high priest wanted to stop
him and defend him the entrance to the sanctuary, he had not taken it into
account, and, persisting in his mad enterprise, he had rejected the words of
the pontiff. To punish him for this impudence, God had struck him with leprosy
on his forehead. For wanting to usurp the honor of others he had lost his own.
For not only did he not obtain the priesthood, but became impure, he was driven
out of the palace, and he spent the rest of his life, hidden in a house, unable
to bear his shame. The people all. He was also punished, because he had
despised the laws of the Lord and had not avenged the honor of the outraged priesthood.
And how was he punished? By the cessation of the ministry of the Prophets: God
in his anger did not answer anything to them any more. He did not do it for
ever, however, but he put the term of the king's life to end this punishment.
When this one came out of life, God also came out of his wrath and opened the
doors of prophecy somehow again. It is to remind us of this that the Prophet
recalls the year of the king's death. Here is the beginning of his prophecy:
"It happened that in the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord
sitting. And yet Christ says, "Nobody has ever seen the Father; the only
Son who is in the bosom of the Father is the one who made him known. (John, II,
18.) And again: "No, that no one has seen the Father, but he who is of God,
because he has seen the Father. (John, vil. 46.) And he himself said to Moses:
"No one can see my face and live yet. How can Isaiah say that he saw the
Lord? "I saw," he said, "the Lord. He said nothing contrary to
the words of Christ, nothing that suited them. Christ speaks indeed of a clear
sight, such as no one has ever had; but none other than the Son has seen this
divine nature uncovered and without shadow, and the Prophet says that he has
had a view according to his own nature. He did not see what God is, but he saw
it as in the figure, and God had been willing to lower himself as much as the
weakness of the Seer wanted. That neither he nor the other prophets saw
divinity uncovered, their words clearly show. "I saw," he said,
"the Lord sitting. Praise God does not sit down; it is a figure borrowed
from the body. And not only "sitting," but "on a throne. Now,
nothing can contain God how could it be contained somewhere, the one who is
present everywhere, who fills everything, "in whose hand are the limits of
the earth? (Ps. XCIV, 4.) This shows that if this vision took place, it was
because God was lowering himself. This is what another prophet, speaking in the
name of God, says: "I have multiplied the visions (Hosea, xii, 10); That
is to say, I let myself be seen in various ways. If it were his pure substance
that one had discovered, one would not have seen it in various ways. But to
show that it was by condescension that he allowed himself to be seen by the
prophets, sometimes in this way, sometimes from this other, conforming these
visions to the various circumstances, he said: "I have multiplied the
visions, and the prophets have represented to you under different images. I did
not seem like I was, he meant, but I complied with the weakness of those who
looked at me. So you see, sometimes seated, sometimes armed, sometimes covered
with white hair, sometimes in the open air, sometimes in the fire, now;
diverting, sometimes on cherubim, sometimes at last, more brilliant than the
most brilliant metals. To say why it appears sometimes armed and covered with
blood, sometimes in the fire, sometimes turning away, sometimes in the sky,
sometimes on a throne, sometimes on the cherubim, this is not here the place,
lest the off -work does not absorb the work. However, the present vision
demands that (381) we examine it. Why then does he appear seated on a throne,
and surrounded by seraphs? He borrows the customs of men, because he addresses
men. As he was going to speak of great things which concerned all the earth, or
Jerusalem in particular, he pronounces a double sentence, the one by which he
announces a great punishment to the capital and to the whole nation, the other
by which he promises to the earth a great benefit, great hopes and immortal
honor.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. When rendering a
sentence, it is customary not to do so in secret, but to sit on an elevated
platform, to be surrounded by all, and to open the curtains. It is to imitate
those judges of the earth that God is surrounded by seraphim, and that he sits
on a high throne to pronounce his judgment. And to show you that this is not a
conjecture, but it is the custom of the Lord to do so, I want you to see the
same thing in another prophet. When, in the prophet Daniel, he is on the point
of pronouncing an important sentence about the punishments and punishments that
the Jews have attracted and the great goods that are going to be given to the
earth, we see here also a thrilling throne and splendid, legions of angels that
surround him, multitudes of archangels, the only Son sitting next to the
Father, books that are open, rivers of fire that roll their terrible waves, all
the device finally d a formidable tribunal. And our passage is quite similar to
that one, or rather that one is clearer still, the times having become closer
and the prophecy having come to an end. But let the studious men make the
comparison of these prophecies, to seize their likeness, let us hasten to
return to the first, and let us stop with every word as much as possible. This
is how everything we said will become clearer for you and for us. What does the
Prophet say? "I saw the Lord sitting. To sit on a throne is always the
mark of a judge, according to the words of David: "You have sat on a
throne, you who judge justice; And this one from Daniel: "The thrones were
brought and the judges sat down." This state of sitting alone marks yet
another thing, according to the same prophet. What? Fixity, firmness, solidity,
eternity, endless life. That is why it is said: You are seated for eternity,
and we perish (1). You, you live, you are, you live, you always stay the same.
He does not speak of the siege, the opposite member shows it well. He does not
say indeed, we are standing, but we perish. To sit on a throne is therefore to
judge; This is why the Prophet sees God seated on a high and high throne;
perhaps the meaning of these two words is not the same. The throne was high,
that is to say, large, very long; high, that is to say placed at an unspeakable
height. "And the house was filled with his glory. " Which house? Tell
me. The temple. As from there came the subject of his anger, it was right that
it was there that he showed himself in this admirable vision. What he calls his
glory is that splendor, that inaccessible light which, despairing of being able
to give by word, he calls glory, and not only glory, but glory of God.
"Seraphim were standing encircled at the turn of him. What does he call
seraphim? These incorporeal and celestial powers, whose name alone indicates
virtue and happiness. For this word of the Hebrew language is interpreted by
mouths of fire.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">What does this
circumstance teach us? The purity of this nature, his vigilance, his diligence,
his agility, his strength, his simplicity. Likewise the prophet David, to show
how the ministry of the powers from on high is quick, quick, active, says,
"Who serve you the winds to make them your messengers, and burning flames
to make them your ministers (Ps. CIII, 4); Words by which he shows us their
velocity, their lightness, their rapidity. It is the same with those powers
who, by pure songs, praise the Lord, continually fulfill this office,
constantly offering him their praises and homage. What shows their dignity is
that they are placed near the throne. As well as in the service of the kings of
the earth, those who are higher in dignity, stand near the throne; Thus these
heavenly powers, because of their superior virtue, surround the throne from on
high, endlessly enjoying unspeakable happiness, and eternally delighting in
this sublime ministry. "One had six wings and the other six, of two they
veiled their feet, of, two they veiled the face, and of the two others they
flew. They cried to one another and said: Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of
armies. The earth is full of his "glory. What do these wings tell us?
These powers have no wings since they have no body; but by these sensible
figures, the Prophet wants to make us understand hidden things, he condescends
by that to the weakness of those who listened to him, and yet, by this
condescension, he makes us understand excellently thoughts that surpass all
intelligence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. What do these wings
mean? The elevated and sublime nature of these powers. Thus we are shown
Gabriel flying and descending from heaven, to teach us his speed and lightness.
And will you be surprised if the Prophet uses these expressions in speaking of
the powers that serve God, when he did not disdain to lower himself to this
means, by speaking of God himself, of the God of the universe? For, wishing to
show either his incorporeality or the speed with which he is present
everywhere, David says: "He who walks on the wings of the winds (Ps. CIII,
3); The winds, however, have no wings, and God does not walk on their wings.
How, indeed, would it be, since it is present everywhere? But, as I said before,
the Prophet condescends to the weakness of the listeners and uses things that
they can understand to elevate their thought. It is thus that, in order to show
the assistance he receives and the safety that this help gives him, he uses the
same expressions, saying, "You will protect me in the shade of your wings.
Here the Prophet does not only wish, by means of these wings, to make us
understand the elevation and sublimity of these powers, but also another thing
which must strike us with terror. He shows us that, although this vision was
only a shadow, an act of condescension, yet the celestial powers themselves
were incapable of rising to that height of God which was lowering. For if they
hid their feet and their backs, it was because they were frightened, that they
dreaded splendor, that they could not endure the brilliancy which issued from
the throne. So they made themselves as a bulwark of their wings to darken the
brilliance of this vision; they felt what we feel when thunder roars and
lightning shines, and we bend down to the earth.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Now, if the seraphim,
these great and admirable powers, could not look with trembling God sitting and
seated on a throne, if they hid the face and the feet, who will say the madness
of those who boast to know perfectly God, who make curious inquiries on this
immortal nature? "From the other two they were flying, and they were
screaming. What does this flight mean and what does it mean? That they are
constantly around God, that they do not depart from him, that their office is
always the same, sing incessantly with him and praise continually their
Creator. For he did not say, "Shouted," but "shouted," that
is to say, they constantly fulfill this duty. "One to the other and they
dared: Holy, Holy, Holy. This indicates that their agreement was perfect and
their agreement to praise God complete. This song is not only a praise, but a
prophesy of the goods that the earth will receive and a very just expression of
the dogma. But why, after saying "Saint" once, were they not silent? why
did not they stop even after saying it twice? why did they repeat it three
times in a row before taking a break? Is it not obvious that it was because
they were singing a hymn to the Trinity? So Saint John applies this hymn to the
Son, Saint Luke to the Holy Spirit, and the Prophet to the era. And the rest
expresses the same thought. For after this song they add: "All the earth
is full of his glory. These words are an exact prophecy; they predict the
future knowledge which was to fill the whole earth with the glory of God,
whereas on the contrary, in antiquity and at the very moment when these words
were pronounced, the whole earth, and even Judea, was filled with iniquity, and
no one glorified God. And the Prophet testifies, who says, "Because of
you, my name is blasphemed among the nations. (Ps. LII, 5.) When was the earth
filled with her glory? When this hymn was brought to earth, when men sang with
the heavenly powers, that they have heard more than one song, resound that same
praise. (read if an impudent Jew refuses to believe me, to show me when the
earth has been filled with the glory of God, this glory which comes from
knowledge, but he could never show it to me, when he would deny me a thousand
times. "The top of the (383) door was shaken by the sound of this great
shout." Do you see the clarity of the prophecy and how things follow each
other? When this song had sounded and the earth had been filled from the glory
of God, the Jewish nation disappeared, as indicated by the top of the door shaken.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. Indeed, it is a sign
that the temple will be abandoned and overthrown; when the temple is
overthrown, all the rest will disappear. And to teach you that the New
Testament abrogated the Old, the Prophet said, "The top of the door was
shaken by the sound of that loud cry," that is to say, when this hymn of
praise came true hear, when grace shone, when the glory of God spread over all
the earth, the shadows vanished. "And the house was filled with smoke. In
my opinion, this prophesies the ruin that will reach it, the fire that
foreigners will put in it, and the fire that will devour it. "Then I say,
Unhappy that I am! My affliction is great, I am a man, of unclean lips, living
in the midst of a people whose lips are unclean, and who have seen with my own
eyes the Lord of Hosts. This vision terrified, stupefied the Prophet; she has
given him a strong fear, she makes him make a confession, and thanks to her, he
knows better the weakness of his nature. "So are all the saints; the more
they are honored, the more they humble themselves; Abraham, when he speaks to
God, is called earth and dust; Paul, after having been judged worthy of this
admirable vision, is called aborton; in the same way Isaiah deplores his
condition, first of all because of his nature: "Unhappy that I am! My
affliction is great, I am a man; Then, because of his dispositions: "I who
help unclean lips." He calls his impure lips relatively, it seems to me,
to the inflamed tongues of these excellent powers, and so to their homage so
perfect. Then, without stopping there, he makes humiliating confessions in the
name of all the people, and adds: "I who live in the midst of a people
whose lips are impure. Why does he here accuse their lips? To mark that he does
not dare to speak. The three children in the furnace used almost the same
expressions: "We are not allowed to open our mouths. And when the time had
come to sing and praise, to see the angels perform this office, it is not
without reason that he speaks from the lips, since it was for them especially
to fulfill this ministry. This is why he calls his impure lips; and if he also
calls those of the people impure, it is not for the same reason, but because
the people were addicted to iniquity. "And I saw with my own eyes the
King, the Lord. This is what makes me moan and cry; it is because I have been
judged worthy of this honor, and I am unworthy of it, of that honor which
surpasses both my merits and my nature. And when he says, "I saw," he
does not mean to speak of a complete view, but of that which was possible for
him.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">And see how his
confession is rewarded. He accused himself and immediately he was purified; for
when he had spoken these words, "One of the seraphim," said he,
"was sent to me; he had in his hand a coal which he had taken with
tweezers from above the altar. And having touched my mouth, he said to me,
"This coal has touched your lips, that it has taken away your sins, and
has cleansed your iniquities." (6,7) "Some say these were symbols of
future mysteries: the altar, the fire that burned there, the servants, that
mouth purified by fire, and those sins erased; for us, let us relate to the
story, and say why it happened. The Prophet will be sent to the Jewish people
to announce terrible and terrible things. Seraphim are sent to him to fill him
with fear and frankness. And so that he should not pretend, like Moses, that he
had a slender voice, or like Jeremiah that he was too young and say that he had
impure lips, that he could not execute the order that he had received, the
seraphim come to blot out his sins, not by their own power (this belongs only
to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit), but by the mission they had been
given and the coals that they bring him. For the seraphim does not say, "I
wipe out," but "behold, this charcoal wipes away your sins and
cleanses your iniquities." By the command of Him who sent me. Why does the
seraph, to take this coal, use a tweezer? An intangible power can not be afraid
of burning itself with a coal. Why does this happen? It's another new condescension.
So he will take it on the altar where sacrifices of worship and atonement were
offered. If you ask why the mouth of the (384) Prophet was not burnt, I will
answer you first of all that this fire was not a sensible fire, although it had
the appearances, then that when God operates some you must not do curious and
difficult research on your operation.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. What do I say, one has
sometimes seen a fire burning and sensible to reproduce the effect which is
peculiar to it on bodies delivered to it? If, then, in this furnace filled with
branches and pitch, the flame forgot its own nature, why surprise you that in
such an extraordinary circumstance fire, far from consuming, only served to
purify? "I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who shall
go to this people? Do you see what the vision produced, the good that the fear
has done? The same thing happened to Moses. If he saw neither the seraphim nor
God seated on a throne, the sight that appeared to him was not less strange, it
was even so amazing that no one could have contemplated it. For "the bush
burned, without being consumed. (Exodus III, 2.) And yet, after this great
prodigy, and although God had greatly encouraged him, the great Moses
hesitated, he imagined a thousand pretexts to escape his mission: "I
have," he said. , "The voice is small and the tongue awkward."
(Exod IV, 10, 13.) Another prophet says. "Choose another, Lord, to send
it. It is Jeremiah who speaks thus in alleging his youth (Jeremiah I, 16.)
Ezekiel, although he had received a precise order, still remains seven days
near the river, full of hesitation and not feeling the same. force to
accomplish his mission. And God says to him again, "I made you to watch
over the house of Israel; And again: "I will ask you again of their
souls" (Ezek III, 17, 18.) Jonah did more than refuse, he fled. What ! Is
Isaiah more bold than they all, bolder than the great Moses? Who would dare to
say it? Why, then, does one hesitate after having received the order, while the
other, without an evident command, ardently embraces this office of prophet?
God does not say to him: Go, but he only says, "Whom shall I send? And
Isaiah leaves immediately. Some say that after having sinned by not taking back
Uzziah from his sacrilegious daring, he wanted to repair his fault, accepting
with eagerness the mission that he did. He gave God to appease him; for this
reason his lips, he said, were impure, because he had not spoken frankly. But I
can not agree with this opinion; Paul is more worthy of faith, he who calls
Isaiah man without fear: "Isaiah does not fear to say. It is afraid that
he did not end his life with a natural death, but the Jews inflicted the last
punishment on him, because they could not bear his energetic tanning. Besides,
the Scripture nowhere says that he was present when Uzziah showed his daring,
or that the seer himself was silent: those who affirm it make only a base
conjecture. What shall we say then? That the ministry of Moses and this one are
not alike. One is sent to a furious and foolish king in a foreign and barbarous
country, the other is sent to his compatriots, who had often heard the prophets
and received their instructions for a long time the obedience of the one did
not require the same courage as that of the other. Some still say that it was
another cause which gave him this boldness. As he had confessed in his name and
in the name of the people, and a seraphim had been sent to him to purify his
lips, he hoped that the same favor would be given to the people and that he
would be a deputy to announce it to him. This would be the reason why he would
have shown no sign of eagerness. If the saints love God, they are also the ones
who love men the most. Also, as Isaiah hoped that he would have to announce to
the people the forgiveness of his sins, he hastened to exclaim: "Here am
I: send me. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Besides, he had a brave
soul against danger, which is what his whole ministry shows us. Since, after
his promise, he no longer dared to refuse, he received his sad message. But see
how wisely God is handling it! He does not tell him at once: Go and say, but he
holds him for a moment in suspense before revealing to him what order he will
give him, what mission he must confide to him. Then, when he sees him ready to
obey, he declares to him the evils which will strike at the Jews. What are
they? "Go and tell this people: You will hear and you will not understand;
you will look and you will not see. For the heart of this people is hardened,
their ears are clogged, and their eyes closed, lest their eyes see, and their
ears hear, and their hearts understand, and not become converted (385) and that
I do not heal them (9, 10). "All commentary is useless, since this passage
has had such eminent interpreters, I mean, John, the son of thunder, and Paul,
who knew so well the Old and the New Testament. The latter, addressing Rome to
persons who had listened to him, but who could not bear his doctrine, had said
to them: "The Holy Ghost has said, You will hear and understand nothing.
As for the son of thunder, as the Jews saw miracles and did not believe, heard
the doctrine and did not embrace it, they had seen Lazarus risen and they
wanted to kill the Christ who had restored him to life; Jesus had cast out
demons and they called him possessed of the devil; he had offered them to his
Father, and they called him a seducer; they adopted opinions contrary to the
truth about him. John reminded them of this prophecy in the following terms:
"The prophet Isaiah said it well: you will hear and not understand; you will
see and not discern. (John, xii, 38, 40.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. As in them the inner
eyes of the soul were blinded, it was of no use to them to have open eyes of
the body, if their judgment was corrupted. This is why they heard without
understanding and saw without discerning; and the Prophet indicates the cause
which resided not in the corruption of their senses, nor in the depravity of
their nature, but in the blindness of their heart. "The heart of this
people is hardened; But this hardening is caused by sins and passions. It is
from him that St. Paul says: "I could not speak to you as to spiritual
men; you could not stand this language and you can not yet. (I Corinthians III,
1.) And he indicates the cause in these terms: "Since there are between
you lawsuits, jealousy, rivalries," are you not carnal men? These, too,
blinded by hatred and envy, a prey to a thousand other passions, had lost the
eye of their intelligence, and could no longer have a clear view of things. so
their thoughts about the things they saw were moving away from the truth and
contradicting each other. The prophet, who knew their condition perfectly,
discovered in advance the cause of the evil. But see to whom are entrusted the
two prophecies! it is the seraphim who manifest the one who looks at the Church
and the goods promised to the earth, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
of armies, all the earth is full of his glory; As to whoever looks upon the
captivity and chastisements of the Jews; they leave it to the Prophet and thus
teach us the superiority of the Church.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And I said, How
long, Lord? Do you see that our conjectures were well founded, when we said
that the Prophet had shown much readiness to obey? After learning things very
contrary to those he expected, I mean plagues, disasters, he wants to know how
far punishment will go; for he dares not undertake to turn away from them all
the wrath of the Lord, because God first showed him that their sins deserve no
pardon. Their crime, in fact, was neither robbery nor the spirit of robbery,
but an affected disobedience, a spirit of contradiction that was systematically
opposed and biased against what God was doing. This is what the Prophet says in
these terms: "lest their eyes see, their hearts understand, they convert,
and I heal them. "As if they feared," he said, "to learn what to
know, they put all their care to blind their intelligence. As the crime was
serious and the punishment inevitable, the Prophet wishes to learn what he
still does not know; but while wanting to learn from it he begs. Since he did
not dare to show clearly that he was begging, he imagines questioning on the
pretext of learning, "How long, Lord?" And he says, "Until the
cities are deserted and deprived of their power. inhabitants, until the houses
no longer have any dwelling there; and the earth will be deserted. And then God
will banish men far from their land, and those who have been left on the earth
will multiply: for one tenth will remain. And this very part will be smitten,
and it will become like the fruit of the terebinth or as the acorn out of its
envelope, and the race which will be born from it will be holy (11-13). After
this prophecy, he returns to the story, foretells the defeat of the ten tribes,
then the patience with which God, because of this captivity, will make use of
the two tribes; then how will the latter be taken away, in their turn, because
they have not (386) removed from the celestial patience any profit, how finally
their debris will flourish again. When he says "until their cities are
deserted and deprived of inhabitants," he announces the ruin of the ten
tribes. Indeed, all of them, I repeat, had disappeared, and violently removed,
all had been taken to a foreign country, so that all the cities were deserted
and no one was there to produce fruit necessary to those who remained. So
saying, "Until the cities are deserted and deprived of inhabitants, until
the houses have no one to live in them," he announces captivity. And when
he says, "Then God will banish your men away from their land," he
announces either complete happiness for all, or the prosperity of the two
tribes after the departure of the ten others. And in fact, having been
delivered from Sennacherib and the army of the barbarians, having obtained this
unexpected victory, they saw their number increase prodigiously, and their life
prolonged, because no war disturbed them more. Then saying "he went
away," he wants to speak of men or armies. And to make you see that he
speaks of the two tribes, he adds, "there will remain one tenth,"
calling tenth what exceeds ten, which is above ten, that is to say, the two
tribes. This is how Paul says "more than five hundred brothers (I
Corinthians XV, 10)," that is to say, a number greater than five hundred.
"And this very part will be smitten, and it will become like the
terebinth," that is to say, the two tribes. "Or like the glans out of
his envelope. Just as this fruit, once taken out of its envelope, is unpleasant
to see, so they will be an object of ridicule and mockery, when they are
banished from their city and deprived of their glory. "And the race that
is born of it will be holy. These evils, he says, will be neither without cure
nor without term; their race will be holy and it will remain, that is to say,
it will be firm, fixed, motionless, and it will be able to wait for the face of
events to change. It is true that they will lose their prosperity; but they
will not have to suffer extreme ills; they will remain and remain until they
return to their first way of life and their first holiness.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">1. I will repeat here
what I have already said many times, that the purpose of the prophecies was not
only to teach the Jews the future, but to make sure that this knowledge was
advantageous to them, that fear caused by threats made them wiser, that the hope
of rewards made them more zealous for virtue, and that they knew by what power
and what God's providence was over them. Such is the reason for the kind of
prologue which opens this prophecy; it was to prevent us from believing that
these events happened (387) at random and without rule, according to the course
of nature or a certain order of things, and to teach the Israelites that they
were directed from above and by the will of God, which should singularly help
them to know God. But, as I have already said above, the prophecy did not have
its proof at the very moment and the words preceded by much the events, so that
when they arrived, some were already dead and could not judge the truth of what
they had heard, see what God does and what means He takes. He joins prophecy to
prophecy, the nearest to the most distant, showing thus by those whose current
generation will see the realization, the faith that must be given to those who
will arrive much later. In the Gospel, it is by another means that he reaches
the same end; there he binds miracles to prophecies and confirms one by
another. This is what I mean: a leper approaches Jesus and is cleansed; then
the servant of the centurion is delivered from his sickness; these were great
miracles; but without stopping at the miracles, he adds a prophecy. For when
the centurion had shown that faith so vivid, so admirable, by which he deserved
that his servant be healed, Christ added: "Many will come from the East
and from the West and will have their place in the kingdom of heaven with
Abraham. Isaac and Jacob, while the children of the kingdom will be banished.
With these words, Jesus prophesies the vocation of the Gentiles and the
reprobation of the Jews, events which are now realities and are to everyone's
wishes more clear than the sun; but then they were obscure, and the unbelievers
refused to admit them; so Christ, by the miracle he did then, led his hearers
to firmly believe what he proclaimed for a more distant time, just as today
seeing the fulfillment of the prophecy, we believe more firmly the miracle that
took place then. What could the unbeliever answer? That the leper has not been
cleansed? Let him see the truth of the prophecy and make it believe in the
miracle. What could contemporary Jews have answered? That what he announced was
not true? But they had only to see the purified leper, and learn from what had
been done to him not to refuse to believe what they did not see; to assure them
of the prophecy they had the miracle, as those of today have the prophecy to
assure them of the miracle. Do you see one thing confirm the other?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"> </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">The same conduct is seen
in the Old Testament. When Jeroboam gave himself up to these excesses of
madness and raised these golden calves, a prophet came to announce the future
to him and on arriving he did a miracle, so that no one would refuse to believe
in things that were to arrive at the end of three hundred years; he broke the
altar, threw away the fat of the sacrifices, and paralyzed the king's hand,
thus giving, by the wonders of that moment, a clear proof of the reality of the
things which were to come long afterwards. Such has often been the conduct (the
God in the Old and New Testaments, of God who, by these various means, provided
for our salvation, which is what happens here and even in a more extraordinary
way; only by a miracle, he made both a prophecy and a miracle, but to interpret
this story better, let us look closely at it: "It came to the time of Ahaz
the son of Joathan the son of Uzziah king of Judah; And it came to pass, I say,
that Basin king of Syria, and Phacena the son of Romelie king of Israel, went
to Jerusalem to attack it, and they could not take it; from David, whom Aram
had made with Ephraim (1, 2). "It is a story that these words, an
exposition of facts, but for the one who has intelligence, penetration, there
is He will see the wisdom of God and His providence over the Jews, He did not
repress this war from its origin, and He did not allow the enemies to seize the
but, while making threats, he prevented the effect, for he only wished to
awaken the Jews, to bring them out of their torpor and to show his power,
since, even when the danger has become imminent, he can deliver as easily as if
the same danger were yet to be born, something you may notice in many
circumstances, for example, in the furnace of Babylon, in the lion's den, and
in rags on other occasions. These kings came, they besieged the city, but all
their efforts only led to attacking the walls and frightening the besieged.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. And this shows us that
the crime of the ten tribes was not only to have lit a civil war and to have
taken up arms (389) against their brethren, but also to have bound themselves
with the peoples born of Another family, of another race, to have taken as
their allies nations with whom all communication was forbidden to them, to have
placed their camp beside them, and to have besieged the city with them. For
they made Basin, a stranger, walk against their metropolis. And the forces of
the combatants were unequal. In some, an innumerable multitude, cities,
nations, peoples; among the others, none of this, but only one city, the
capital, so that the strength of God might appear with more brilliance. Nobody,
indeed, raised his arms against these enemies, nobody attacked them, no one
worried them, and yet their perverse efforts did not succeed. "For,"
said the Prophet, "they could not take it. And what prevented them? Only
the hand of God, who invisibly pushed them away. However, as I said, he made
the evil disappear without immediately removing the fear. "And it was told
at the house of David that Aram had leagued with Ephraim. And the heart of the
king and the heart of his people were seized. When God prepares himself to do
something amazing, he does not immediately perform the miracle, but he first
lets those who are to collect the fruit, how much their evils are serious, so
that after their deliverance they are careful not to show the slightest
ingratitude. Since, in fact, most men, either out of pride or negligence,
forget their evils when they are delivered from them, or, if they do not forget
them, attribute to themselves all the glory, God let them first feel their
troubles and then deliver them from their enemies, which he did especially in
this circumstance. He let fear take possession of hearts, he delivers them in
prey to a great dejection, and then he sends deliverance. This is what happened
to the great David. The Lord was to lead him to battle and raise a shining
trophy by his hands; but he did not do so from the commencement of the war; At
first he left the Israelites a prey to fear for forty days, and when they
regarded their salvation as desperate, that the barbarian Goliath threw them a
thousand insults without anyone daring to rise up and march against him; then,
I say, while they themselves confessed their defeat, and their helplessness had
become evident, he sent to the war this young man and made him win this
astonishing victory. And if after all this, after such a proof of helplessness,
Saul, when he was delivered, let himself go to hatred and jealousy, and set up
ambushes for David; if he allowed himself to be conquered by his passion and
was ungrateful. to his benefactor, what would he not have done if he, if his
army had not so highly confessed their cowardice?</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">ou will see God doing so
in many other circumstances, especially in this one. He intended to deliver the
Israelites from this war and to remove from them all danger; but he lets them
feel their troubles first. "The heart of the king and the heart of his people
were seized and trembled, as the trees of the forests shake with the wind
tremble. It is the characteristic of the prophecy to reveal the hidden things.
She shows us the disposition of everyone and, for clarity, she adds an image to
show how extreme this fear was. Their heart, she said, was agitated; they were
in utter prostration, they despaired of their salvation, they thought they were
in extreme danger, they were not expecting anything good, all were betrayed by
their own thoughts. What does God do? He foretold their deliverance, and
immediately he worked it, so that they could not attribute to any other the
lifting of the siege, and he sent his prophet to announce the future. "The
Lord said to Isaiah, Go to meet Ahaz, and Jasub your son, who dwelt at the pool
on the top of the field of Foulon, and say to him, 'Do not be in the agitation
or terror, and your soul does not fall into despair and have no fear of these
two smoking sticks; for when my anger is gone up, I will save you again (3: 4).
What is it to say, "Go ahead? ". The king, agitated by fear and fear,
was not tranquil; he could not remain in his palace; but, what the besieged
usually do, he continually goes out to visit the ramparts, the gates, running
on all sides, meaning ceases in agitation to know where the enemies were;
wherefore he saith unto him, Go to meet. What does it mean to say, "You
and Jasub, your son who stayed with you?" Jasub, in the Hebrew language,
means conversation and way of life. This is how Jesse sending David told him,
"You will know their condition," that is, you (389) will tell me how
they are doing and what they are doing.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. And here again, it
seems to me, the Prophet is commanded to take a large number of witnesses, so
that after the event the king can not be ungrateful, as if the prophet had not
nothing announced. Here is what he means: Go to meet you and those who are with
you, those of the people who have remained. Do not be surprised if he calls the
people his son; for he said before, "Here I am," I and the children
that God has given me "(Isaiah, VIII, 18.) And certainly the saints were
really fathers and surpassed, by their charity and their love for this people
all those to whom nature has given the name of father. He said: "who have
remained," because the war had taken away many, "on the way to the
field of the Foulon. This seems very difficult to explain, that besieged people
confined in their city and not even daring to look beyond the walls, have shown
themselves out of doors, for today this road is situated outside the gates.
What is the solution of this difficulty? It is because formerly the city had a
second wall; she had two enclosures of fortifications, and you will easily see
it by the words of another prophet, if you want to pay attention to it. This prophet
therefore goes out to lift up these slaughterings and tries to give them hope
for the future. Be quiet, says the Lord, and do not be afraid; he calls these
two kings fire; and so he marks with one stroke and their strength and
weakness. For he adds "smoking," that is to say, close to extinction.
Then, to show that it was not by their power, but by God's permission that they
had come to attack the city, he said: "When my anger is mounted, I will
save you again. The son of Aram and the son of Romelie, united in a sinister
design, as well as Ephraim, said against you, We will go up to Judea and ravage
her. acting by mutual agreement, we will make it fall into our traps and we
will establish there for king the son of Tabéel. This is what the Lord of Hosts
says: These thoughts will not subsist and have no effect. Damascus will remain
the capital of Syria and Basin will reign in Damascus, and in sixty-five years,
Ephraim will cease to be in the rank of peoples. Samaria will be the capital of
Ephraim, and the son of Romelie will reign in Samaria. And if you do not
believe, you will not understand (5, 9). "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Here again, the Prophet
gives his prophecy an excellent confirmation. After he has excited fear, put
under the eyes of imminent evils, made hope for goods still far removed and
surpassing all expectations, as the hearers were not very firm in their faith,
here is the means he employs It gives, from the reality of future events, the
most striking proof, by making known the very designs of the enemies. He makes
known the thought that they had while walking on the city, what they said to
each other, the pact they had made before leaving and it shows or that it was a
betrayal (acting of by mutual agreement, we will make it fall into our trap),
or that a foolish pride had seized them, since they believed they needed no
weapons, no fight, no fight to take the city. It is enough for us to show
ourselves, to speak; we will take them all and we will go away. Then, as often
happens to boasters, swollen with pride by this very hope, they think of a
king, as if the city were already taken, and they seek what master to give to
this capital. This, he says, is what they do; but God will confuse these
projects. This is why he says, "This is what the Lord says," and
without stopping there, he adds, "armies. When, indeed, he wishes to
announce something great, he recalls the power of God, his dominion over all
things, this astonishing and admirable strength. What does God say? "These
thoughts will not subsist and have no effect: Damascus will remain the capital
of Syria. His power, he means, his authority will be limited to Damascus and
will not go further. "And Basin will reign in" Damascus, "and
Basin will continue to be the king of Damascus, that is, he will remain in his
present possessions, without acquiring greater power. "And in sixty years
Ephraim will cease to be of the rank of peoples. "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">4. It is a very great
proof of the truth to see the prophets assign the precise time in advance, and
thus give those who desire it the means to ascertain the value of the prophecy.
For today, he says, they will only withdraw from the city; but in sixty-five
years the kingdom of Israel will perish; the enemies will take them and take
them all. But until this ruin they will not have anything more than what they
have now. These words are said to completely reassure Ahaz. Indeed, if the
Prophet were content to say: in sixty-five years your enemies will perish, the
king may have said to himself: But what! if they are to perish only after having
conquered us, what advantage will it accrue to us? Be quiet, says Isaiah, even
for the present moment; later they will perish entirely, and for the moment
they can not grow. But Samaria will be the capital of Ephraim, that is to say
of the ten tribes (there was their government), and they will not extend
beyond; and the king of Israel shall reign in Samaria, and repeat here what he
says of Damascus, to show that they have nothing more than what they have now.
Then, as the things he had just announced surpassed all human intelligence and
all reasoning, he is right to add. "If you do not believe, you will not
understand. Do not seek, he means, how nor in what way will these things
happen; for it is God who will do them, it is only necessary to believe and to
think of the power of the one who will act: that is all the proof of what I
have announced. This is also why the prophet David says, "I believed,
that's why I spoke. (Ps. CXV, 10.) And Paul, taking this word with good reason,
gives him still more meaning, saying, "Having the same spirit of faith, as
it is written, I have believed, that's why I spoke, and we too believe and
that's "also why we talk. Indeed, if faith were necessary for these
ancient things, as far removed from those of the New Testament as the earth is
far from heaven, how much more is it not necessary for these truths? so high
and no intelligence has ever understood. This is what the Apostle says in what
follows: "What the eye has not seen, what the ear has not heard, what is
not mounted in the heart of the man, this is what God has prepared for those
who love him. (I Corinthians II, 9)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">"And the Lord spoke
again to Ahaz, and he said, Ask the Lord your God to show you a wonder, whether
in the depths of the earth or in the highest heaven. And Ahaz said, I will not
ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear now, O house of
David: Is it not enough for you to weary the patience of men, without boring
that of God? So the Lord will give you a sign himself. Behold, the Virgin will
conceive and she will give birth to a son who will be called Emmanuel
"(10-14). Great is the condescension of God and great also the ingratitude
of the king. The latter must, on hearing the Prophet, no longer doubt his
words; that if he retained doubt, he should have driven him away, as many Jews
did, on seeing a miracle. For God, in his love for men, did not refuse
prodigies to these rude men, crawling and attached to the earth; this is what
happened, for example, to Gideon (1). As Ahaz was very rude, incredulous, see
how condescending God is. He himself attracts and excites him to ask for a
miracle; certainly it was not a little prodigy to have revealed his secrets, to
have unveiled all his thoughts, to have manifested all his hypocrisy. When the
Prophet had said to him, Ask a miracle, this ungodly man made the believer, and
said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord; see how vehemently the
Prophet resumes it; and it is with good reason that, after showing his
hypocrisy, he accuses him with more severity. This is why he does not judge him
worthy of an answer and addressing the people he says: "Listen, then,
house of David: Is it little for you to weary the patience of men, without
boring that of God? ? And how do you tire that of God? This is obscure; We also
make every effort to clarify this word. This is what he means: are they my
words? Are these my thoughts? If it is a fault worthy of blame to refuse
without any motive, for no reason, to believe men, how much more to believe
God! To lose patience is, therefore, nothing more than to be incredulous. Is
this, he says, a weak crime? Is it a slight fault to refuse to believe men? But
if this is serious, how much more refuse to believe God!</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">5. The Prophet spoke thus
to teach everyone that he had not been deceived, and that he judged not from
the words that he had heard, but from the thoughts of Ahaz. This is what Christ
has done so often in the Gospel. Before manifesting itself by miracles, he
reproaches the Jews for their wickedness, although they had not yet shown it
outside: this is what happened, for example, when the paralytic was cured. In
fact, after having told him: "My son, trust me; your sins are given to
you, "as they said in themselves," This one blasphemes, "Christ,
before strengthening the paralytic, addresses them to them:" Why do you
think evil in your hearts? He gives them the greatest proof of his divinity by
showing them that he knows secret thoughts. "For it is written, only you
know the courses. "(III Kings, VIII, 39.) And David said again," God
who scrutinizes hearts and loins. God often gave this knowledge to the prophets
to show that their words were not human, but that they came from above, from
heaven. That is why this Isaiah with the great voice, after having shown so
much sweetness in speaking to the king, to have removed him from danger, to
have reassured him for the present, and to have given him as a pledge of the
truth of his prophecy the revelation of the designs formed by the enemy, the
discovery of treason, the announcement of a complete and absolute ruin for
Israel, the precise determination of the time, Isaiah, I say, without being
content with that, is going to still further, he does not wait for the king to
ask for a miracle, he exhorts him despite his excessive disbelief; moreover, he
leaves him the master of the choice: he does not tell him "such or such a
miracle," but "whatever you want." The Master is rich, his power
infinite, his power unspeakable. Do you want it in the sky, nothing opposes it;
on the earth, no obstacle. This is what these words mean "or at the bottom
of the earth or in the highest heaven. As he himself did not decide, the
Prophet, far from being silent, added a severe reproach, and that, to convert
the king, to show him that he had not been able to deceive, to give the change
on his he announces an ineffable event, he prophesies the salvation of the
earth and the renovation of all things, and he says that this sign will not be
for Ahaz alone, but for all the people.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">In the beginning he
addressed the king; but when he had revealed his unworthiness, he spoke to all
the people: "So," he said, "he will give a sign, not to the law,
but to you. Who are you? To you who are in the house of David. It is from there
as from a stem that this sign will emerge. And what sign? "Behold, the
Virgin will conceive and give birth to a son who will be called Emmanuel. It
must be observed, as I said above, that it is no longer in Achaz that this sign
is given. This is not a conjecture: see the accusations and blame of the Prophet:
"Is it little for you to weary the patience of men?" And he adds,
"This is why the Lord will give you a sign . Behold, the virgin will
conceive. If she had not been a virgin, it would not have been a sign. For a
sign must come out of the usual order of things, from the ordinary course of
nature, to have something strange, even strange, to be noticed by everyone who
sees and hears it. That's why it's called a sign, because it means. But it
would not mean if it remained hidden in the usual order of things. So if the
Prophet had spoken of a woman giving birth according to the ordinary course of
nature, why call "sign" something that happens every day? So he does
not say in the beginning, here is a virgin, but "here is the virgin",
wanting to mark by the addition of the article that this virgin was remarkable
and alone among all. That this addition has the indicated meaning, we can see
in the Gospel. When indeed the Jews sent to ask John, "Who are you? They
did not say to him, "Are you Christ," but, "Are you the Christ?
They did not say, "You are a prophet," but: "Are you the
Prophet? John, I, 19-25. That is to say, Christ, the Prophet par excellence.
St. John does not say beginning with the Gospel: "In the beginning was a
Word," but: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was in God.
(John, I, 1.) Similarly here, Isaiah does not say: Behold, a virgin, but
"Behold the virgin," and he puts forth, as it was worthy of a prophet
to do, "Here is that. These events indeed, he saw them almost, he pictured
them by the imagination, they were obvious to him. your prophets saw future
events more clearly than we see what is happening before our eyes. Our senses
can be wrong; the grace of the Holy Ghost removed them from error.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">6. And why not add that
this conception would take place by the virtue of the Holy Spirit? It was a
prophecy, and it was necessary to speak in an obscure manner, as I have often
said, because of the grossness of the hearers, lest an exact knowledge of (392)
things should cause them to burn the books. saints. If they did not spare the
prophets, for all the more reason they would not have spared their books. This
is not a simple conjecture because another king, in the time of Jeremiah, tears
the Bible and delivers it to the flames (Jeremiah, XXXVI, 23.) Do you see this
intolerable madness, this senseless anger? It is not enough for him to make the
book disappear, he burns it to satisfy a delirious passion. Nevertheless this
admirable prophet, even while remaining obscure, knew how to indicate everything.
A virgin, while remaining a virgin, how can she conceive if not by the virtue
of the Holy Spirit? For to break the laws of nature could belong only to the
one who made them. So, saying that the virgin will bear, the Prophet has
unveiled everything. After this birth, he predicts the name of the child, not
the one given to him, but the one that suited him. As he calls Jerusalem the
city of righteousness, not that it ever bore that name, but because all things
gave it to it, because it had to change and become better and fulfill all
righteousness, so still that he calls her a prostitute, not because she has
been so appointed, but because her perversity deserved her name, as her virtue
that of a city of justice, so, for Christ, he gives her the name that the nature
of things indicated. For it was then that God was with us, when he appeared on
earth, conversing with men, and showing them the greatest affection. It is not
an angel, it is not an archangel who is our companion, but it is the Master
himself who comes down and comes to straighten everything, who speaks to the
courtesans, who eats with the publicans, who enters in the houses of sinners,
which allows all thieves to speak to him with confidence, which attracts to him
the Magi, who goes everywhere and reforms everything, and unites our nature.
But the Prophet announces all and this childbirth and the ineffable, immense
goods that flow from it. Indeed, when God is with men, there is no need to
fear, to tremble, but everything becomes reassuring: that's what happened to
us. These ancient and incurable evils have been taken away from us; this
sentence against the whole human race has been erased, sin has lost all
strength, and the devil has all tyranny; the paradise closed to all was opened
for the first time to a murderer and a robber, the vaults of heaven have given
us passage, the man has mingled; to the choirs of the angels, our nature has
been carried to the throne of the king; the prison of hell has become useless;
from death there remained only the name, the thing has disappeared; the
choruses of martyrs, women have broken the sting of hell.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">It is in the anticipation
of these events that the Prophet shuddered with joy and gladness, and with a
word he tells us everything, announcing Emmanuel to us. "He will eat
butter and honey; before knowing or choosing the wrong, he will choose the
good. For before distinguishing between good and evil, the child will depart
from evil to seek good (15:16). As this child was not to be simply a man, not
only a God, but a God in a man, it is with reason that the Prophet presents the
thing under several faces, sometimes under this one, sometimes under this one.
and speaks of strange things, lest the greatness of the miracle prevent them
from believing it. After having said that the Virgin will give birth, which is
already above nature, that this child will be called Emmanuel, which is above
all expectation, he wants to prevent that by hearing this word Emmanuel, one
does not to embrace on the Incarnation the errors of Marcion and Valentin, and
he gives the Incarnation the best proof, he draws it from the need of food to
which the God-man will be subjected. What does he say indeed? "He will eat
butter and honey. It does not suit the deity, but our nature. It is still for the
same reason that the Word did not immediately form a man to live in him, but
that he shut himself up in the bosom of a woman, and that for nine months, that
he was born, was enveloped in langes, was nourished as one is in the first age,
to close the mouth to those who would try to deny the Incarnation. Enlightened
by divine grace, the Prophet saw all this; but instead of speaking only of this
birth and of this miraculous birth, he speaks of the food which the man-God
will take in his first age, still clothed in his swaddling clothes, a food
similar to that of other men, and which does not will be nothing extraordinary.
In him everything was not different from us, but not everything was alike. To
be born of a woman is our condition; of a virgin, it is above our nature. To
take food (393) according to the ordinary laws of nature and the same food as
other men is our condition; but to be a stranger to all vice, to have never
given the slightest sign of perversity, is extraordinary, astonishing, and
suitable only to him. This is why the Prophet mentions one and the other thing.
It is not, he says, after having tasted the evil that he departs from it, but
from the beginning and spoke virtue from above he practiced all virtue. This is
what Christ said himself: "Which of you will convict me of sin? And again:
"The prince of this world comes and he has nothing in me. (John, VIII, 46
and XIV, 30.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">7. The very Prophet that
we explain did not he say. "He has not done iniquity, and lies have not
been found in his mouth. (Isaiah, LIX, 9) It is also what he says in the
present passage that before even knowing or choosing the wrong, when he is
still in this age of innocence, at the beginning of his life, he will embrace
virtue and have nothing in common with vice. "For before distinguishing
between good and evil, the child will depart from evil to seek good. He repeats
in the same terms the same thought and insists on the same idea. As his words
proclaimed a sublime thing, he endeavors, by repeating it, to make her believe.
What he said above: before knowing or choosing the wrong, he says again in
these terms: "The child, before distinguishing. And he insists again,
"Good and evil, will depart from evil to seek good. This was the
distinctive character of the child-God. It is that which St. Paul continually
points out, and St. John, on seeing Christ, raises his voice to shout,
"Behold the Lamb of God, he who takes away the sin of the world. (John, I,
29.) But he who removes the sin of others is even more sinless himself. It is also
this character on which, as I said above, St. Paul continually insists. As the
Christ was to die, the Apostle, lest anyone should believe that death was the
punishment for his sin, continually recalls his innocence, to show that his
death was the ransom of our sin. So he says: "Christ, risen from the dead,
no longer dies: for if he is dead, it is for sin that he is dead. (Romans vi.,
9, 10.) And this death, he means, he did not endure as being subject to it and
because of his sin, but because of the sins of all. If, therefore, he were not
subjected to the first, he is more than proved that he will not die.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

which you tremble before these two kings will be abandoned. What the Prophet
does in all circumstances, he does here again. After announcing future events,
he returns to the present. I have shown for a long time that he had done it,
with regard to seraphim, as he acts here. He first prophesies the goods that
the whole earth was to receive, and then he addresses the king. That's why he
says, "The country will be abandoned. What is to say, "abandoned? He
will not be attacked, he will be free, he will have nothing to fear, nothing to
suffer from the evils of war. "The land for which you tremble," for
which you are in terror and anguish "before these two kings" of Syria
and Israel. But so that the announcement of happy events does not soften the
king, and that the peace does not make him indolent, the Prophet throws in his
soul a new anxiety by words: "But the Lord will make come on you, on your
for the people of your father's house, such days as there were none like them,
since Ephraim brought the king of Assyria from Judah (17). By this he indicates
this invasion, in which the barbarians overthrew the city from top to bottom
and carried off all the captive inhabitants. And he announces it, not for it to
come, but so that fear makes them better, they remove these evils from their
heads. As nothing had been able to correct them, nor the goods which had been
left to them without any merit on their part (which shows the disposition of
mind of the king and the excess of his incredulity), nor the threat of danger.
Frightening, and they had resisted these two salutary remedies, Isaiah now
announces a deeper disaster, and that to cut off all corruption and cure these
incurable patients. What do these words mean, "from the day that Ephraim
brought the king of Assyria from Judah? The barbarians came in the design of
removing the whole nation; but they left Judah and his two tribes to cast themselves
on Israel. Here is what the Prophet means: From the day when the ten tribes
will draw on them, by the enormity of their faults, the army of barbarians who
will first come against you, and where they will be taken (394 captivated, from
that day you must fear and tremble: for this army will come forward and come
against you, if you do not change. And he said, From that day God will bring
them. For it was not at the same time that the Israelites that the two tribes
were removed; but the interval was not long.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

says, These days were appointed; but God waited, took patience, even though
their faults merited chastisement: often, when the day of punishment is fixed,
God waits, he temporizes again, a very evident proof of his charity for men, a clear
sign against those who do not do not want to take advantage of his forbearance.
Already, says the Prophet, the threat is made, already the sentence is carried,
already the wrath of God lights up, he shows them the vengeance, so to speak,
at their doors, to excite them to repentance, to make them better, to give them
a strong fear by the ruin of others, and to prevent them from being spared by
the chastisement which had beset others, became even more careless than in the
past.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

the Lord will blow the flies that dominate the tip of the river of Egypt with a
whistle (18). You see, I was right in saying that it is to increase their fear
that God makes them threats from this day forward. The following produces the
same effect, he increases by his words their terror by showing them the armies
they dreaded so much, this invasion so easy (what was to terrify them), the
large number of these barbarians, what should do them lose all insurance; all
these things he indicates in what follows. See, "In that day the Lord will
blow the flies with a whistle. He called flies the Egyptians, because of their
shamelessness and their effrontery, and also because, continually repulsed,
they continually returned to the charge, without letting them breathe, offering
them a thousand traps, constantly harassing them in misfortune, as flies attack
wounds. God, he says, will bring them. But instead of saying he will bring
them, he says: "He will bring them with a whistle," to show how easy
this invasion will be, how invincible is the power of God, to whom it suffices
to make a sign for that everything follows. And it is with good reason that he
takes advantage of this to threaten the evils they have already experienced.
"And the bee who is in the land of Assur. The Syrian and the Hebrew read,
say, not the bees, but the wasps. As the Jews did not know these people well,
the Prophet imparts to them in this figure a greater fear, showing them by this
animal how terrible, frightening, inevitable the enemies will be, how deep
their wounds will be and their sudden presence.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

rest in the gorges of this country, in the hollows of the rocks, in the caves,
in all the holes, on all the trees (19). After having announced how frightening
the presence of the enemies will be, and their rapid march, he says what will
be their multitude. He does not say, they will camp, but "they will
rest," not as if they had come to an enemy country, but as if they lived
in their own homes, not as if they had to work and fight, but as if they ran in
front of a certain victory and assured booty. That is why he says: "They
will come and rest," which is only suitable for conquerors, for men who
have won a victory, and who rest after many struggles and fatigues. And it will
not be in the plains alone that they will rest; but as this multitude is
innumerable and the country is not sufficient to contain it, abysses, rocks,
mountains, forests, everything, in a word, is an asylum for these barbarians.
Even if the enemies were not so terrible, and the Jews so weak, it would be
enough to frighten them; but when these two things are united, the multitude
and the power, when (still more frightful) is the wrath of God that leads them,
what hope of salvation can be preserved? These words "in all the holes, on
all the trees" contain a hyperbole: for they were not going to rest on
trees; but, as I said above, there is both hyperbole and continuation of the
metaphor taken from the wasps.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

are not some Egyptian or Persian barbarians, but God (395) himself who fights
against the Jews. He calls his razor anger before which nothing can resist,
which no one can sustain, who advances and ruins everything without
experiencing the slightest difficulty. Just as the hair can not withstand the
razor's edge, but it yields and falls immediately, so the Jews will not be able
to resist the wrath of God.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Assyrians," that is to say, beyond the Euphrates, as was Judea and all Palestine
compared to those who come from Persia. All this, he says, will be destroyed
entirely. By these words head, hair, beard, feet, he designates the whole
country under a metaphor borrowed from the human body, and he embraces in these
words the whole country, as he did in the beginning when he said: "Any
head is languid and heart-broken. From the feet to the head, there is nothing
intact in him (Isaiah, I, 5, 6); He spoke not of a man, but of the whole
country, which he compared to one body. This is what he means here, to know
that the whole earth will have to undergo exemplary punishment. He borrows on
one side his images with a razor, on the other side to the human body, to show
that the judgment carried by God will produce an effect more terrible than the
razor, that it will make men disappear and all that bring the earth, to leave
it deserted and uninhabited. He is still using another image to express this
desolation. He does it so that fear always grows and stays, and to prevent
terror from diminishing as a result of such a long speech. It seems to some
that these words contain the promise of certain goods; but a deeper examination
shows that there is only the description of extreme desolation. What does he
say indeed? "At that time a man will feed a cow and two sheep, and because
of the abundance of their milk, he will feed on butter; for all who are left on
the earth will eat butter and honey (21:22). "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

above, great loneliness. In fact, the land which produces wheat and barley,
being devoid of inhabitants, will furnish the animals with abundant and
abundant food, which two ewes and a cow feeding on them will give to their
possessor fountains of milk. Thus the abundance of food for the animals is an
obvious mark that the men will have disappeared. And here is what honey says;
bees usually like to live in deserted places because they find abundant food
there and nobody disturbs them. And to better convince you that the Prophet
speaks of extreme loneliness, see the following: "And at that time, in the
places where one thousand thousand vines had been sold thousand shekels, it
will grow only brambles and thorns. . We will enter only with the bow and the
arrows, because brambles and thorns will cover the whole earth (23-24).
"This is the mark of a great misfortune when not only the mountains and
forests, but the arable land itself and the one just waiting for the crop
produces brambles. It is not without reason that he spoke of the price of the
vines, it is to show us the fertility of the land and the care of the farmers.
Well ! he says, "even those places so fertile, so worthy of the care of
the laborers, will be so abandoned that they will produce thorns in the place
of the vines, and will cause those who approach them so much terror that no one
will dare to enter them defenseless and without weapons. These words mark how
the place will be deserted and ferocious animals will live there. After having
troubled the souls and throwing fear into the hearts, the Prophet softens a
little, to announce also happy events, the prosperity which will follow, and to
make understand by one as by the other situation the God's power. But he
insists on the frightening things and only scratches the happy ones. Why that ?
Because it was mostly a reprimand that the people needed to be treated. At this
moment, too, after administering this remedy unceremoniously, wishing to allow
the listeners to breathe a little, and to excite them still to virtue, he
announces happy events by saying: "Every mountain will be cultivated by
the plow. In the same way that, during the wrath of God, even the arable land
has been abandoned, so when it is appeased, the hard earth will become like
loose earth, and like it will be plowed and seeded. When these things happen,
their consequences will also occur, peace, abundance, confidence, security, in
a word, the state of the past, (396) "Fear will be banished. This
infertile land covered with brambles will turn into pasture for the sheep and
be trampled by the oxen (25). By these details the Prophet still indicates
abundance, as he will say further. "Happy who sows all the waters and
sends the ox and the donkey to his pasture. In fact, just as in order to depict
loneliness, he speaks of sirens and onocentaures, likewise, to depict peace and
tranquility, he speaks only of domestic and tamed animals. , fit for field
work; he shows them filling all the places, to make understand the culture and
its consequences.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

literal meaning, it seems that these prescriptions are different and have
nothing in common between them; but if you want to examine the thoughts, you
will find that they come together and have the same goal. But it must be said
first of all in what design the prophetic ministry has been introduced into the
world. What is the mission of prophecy; that's what to say. Ordinarily, God is
slow and tardy in punishing the wicked, as he is quick to reward virtue. So men
with little energy let themselves be carried away, seeing that the punishment
does not immediately follow the faults. Now, to be silent that he is patient,
and that one must not make of his long-suffering a pretext for vice, God uses
the prophecy, not to inflict penalties, but to teach sinners what is wrong with
them. wait, so that the threat makes them better and makes them avoid real
punishments; and it is only when they remain insensitive that he ends by
chastising them. The demon, seeing this design and knowing how beneficial this
ministry is to men, sends out false prophets, to contradict those who announce
famines, pestilences, wars, and to prophesy great prosperity. As God wants, by
inspiring the fear of words, to avoid real punishments, the devil strives to do
the opposite; his speeches please, they soften men, and God sees himself in the
necessity of punishing them. Then, when those who believe the false prophets,
and who, making no case of virtue, have persecuted in their faults, have drawn
severe punishments, and that finally the truth is brought to light while the
lie is confused, the demon employs still other traps to complete the ruin of
those who allow themselves to be caught. He persuades them who are easily
deceived, that these unfortunate events must be attributed to the anger of the
rejected and despised demons. It is to prevent this cunning that God makes men
announce far in advance the evils that will come to them or rather that will
seize them, so that it is not possible for those who deceive men, to attribute
the events to the anger of the demons. It is not by guesswork that I say it:
for hear the words of Isaiah: "I know that you are hard, that your neck is
like an iron bar, that you have a brow of brass. That is why I spoke to you
from the beginning so that you do not say: These are my idols who did these
things, these are my images cut and thrown out of cast iron that gave it to me.
You have not known or heard them. (Isaiah, XLVIII, 4, 5, 8.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">As, therefore, according
to what I have said above and what this passage attests, the Jews opposed the
prophecies to each other, the true prophecy hastens to remedy this error,
announcing the events well in advance . As it was to be presumed that the
ungrateful would have said: You have not predicted it, we have not heard it,
you are forging these prophecies after the event: for you do not know the
future; How will we know that you have spoken in advance? In this language, God
opposes a peremptory answer and closes these impudent mouths. He not only
orders his prophets to speak, but he orders to write the prophecies on paper
and not only to write, but also so that we can not say that it was done
afterwards, he orders to take as witnesses men whom their dignity and conduct
render worthy of faith. "Take me as witnesses," said he,
"faithful men, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah," so that when events
come to pass and the wicked say, "These things have not been predicted in
advance, the book is produced and that men who have witnessed its composition
close these impudent mouths. This is why God says, "Take me a new book of
paper," that it may not perish after a while, but that it remains a long
time, and that its very character accuses the detractors. "And write with
a man's style, with a feather, what must happen. And what must happen? There
will be war, victory won by the barbarians, sharing of remains, removal of
loot. Write, he says, all these things, that you must hasten to take the spoil:
for here is the time. What does it mean, "Here's the time? This word makes
us understand two things, that already the greatness of faults demanded
punishment, and that punishment is imminent. God's patience makes him
temporize: for he desires that they correct themselves and render punishment
useless, and on the other hand it is easy for him by his sole will to make
everything run. Indeed, when it came to the barbarians who were to invade, he
said: Do not think that the length of the road and the multitude of the army
are causes of delay, as often happens in what they do. men.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">2. But for God, even that
which is distant is present, so easy is it in a moment, in a second, to bring
and bring from the ends of the earth even innumerable multitudes. "Take me
as witnesses of the faithful men, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of
Barachias. Witness what? From the time, so that if one comes to recuse these
books, the men who attended their composition and therefore know well the time,
can, when rising impudent opponents, close them the stuffy. The following has
the same purpose and contains more obvious proof. How and in what way? "He
approached," he said, "the prophetess. He thus calls his own wife,
perhaps because she participates in the prophetic spirit: for it is not only to
men that graces are communicated, but also to women. It is not like in temporal
things where the sexes are distinguished, where some have to fulfill the duties
of men, the others of women, without being able to change their role; It is not
so in spiritual things; but everything is common, wreaths and fights. Volts
will see this in the Old and the New Testament and for all positions tic life.
Having approached her according to the law of (398) marriage, he made her
pregnant. And when that woman gave birth to a son, he gives her a strange, extraordinary
name, a prophetic name. What does he say indeed? "Call him, hasten to take
the spoils and share the spoils," so that if one challenges the book, at
least the very name of the child, prophetic name, imposed well before the
events, and since then still in use, silence even the most daring. It will be
evident that the Prophet did not forge it afterwards, but that he had foreseen
these events for a long time, and those who even study to disregard the care of
which they are the object will be forced to believe, since, even before the
events, they will have seen the child bear this name, and consequently
continually announce the misfortunes to come.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">Then he clarifies the
meaning of the prophecy by accurately indicating the time of these misfortunes
- "For before the child knows how to name his father and his mother, the
power of Damascus and the remains of Samaria will be carried to the king of the
Assyrians. . This is what he means: at a time when his age will be very little
advanced, where he will not be able to speak again, the victory will be won,
the trophies will be raised, not that this child can himself arrange the army.
and defeat the enemies, but in this time, that is, before the child can speak;
everything will be delivered to the enemies. "The Lord spoke to me again,
and said to me, Because this people rejected the waters of Siloam, which flowed
gently, and because it was better for them to have King Basin and the son of
Romelia, the Lord will melt down on him the king of the Assyrians, like the
great and violent waters of a river (5-7.)</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">God, more often than not,
announces not only the punishment, but indicates the cause for the instruction
of the hearers; that's what he's doing here too. After having spoken of the
pillage exerted by foreigners and the invasion of the barbarians, he indicates
the cause of this war. What is it? The ingratitude of the inhabitants of the
city. As they had, he said, a gentle, easy, human king, and they broke away to
call tyrants, to try to pass under a foreign domination, because they were
tired of their happiness, eh good ! I will accomplish their desire
superabundantly, bringing into the midst of them a barbarous and cruel man. He
uses metaphorical expressions to portray the character of the native king and
the power of the barbarian king; it acts like this, as I have already said, to
give his word more strength and expression. This is why he says, "Because
this people rejected the waters of Shiloh," a passage where he does not
hear about water, but where, to make understand the sweet and human character
of the king, he compares it to the still tranquil current of this quiet and
quiet spring, and he designates the king by the word of Siloë, the cause of his
mildness and moderation: a great lesson for subjects who, having to endure a
light yoke, wished to rise up and give themselves to foreign kings. Since they
do not want, said he, a gentle and humane king, but they ask for Basin and the
son of Romelie, I will send them the king of Babylon; and the violence of his army
is rendered by the image of a river with abundant and impetuous waters.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">3. Then, interpreting his
metaphor, he says: "The king of the Assyrians. Do you see how certain is
what I said above, that everywhere Scripture itself gave the key to the
metaphors it employed? That's what she's still doing here. She spoke of a
river, but, without continuing her metaphor, she said which river, "the
king of the Assyrians, with all his glory." He will come down in all your
valleys and he will surround all your walls. And he will remove from Judea all
those who can lift their heads or do anything. And his army will be so numerous
that it will cover all your country. To show that all this will happen, not by
virtue of man, but because of God's wrath, he does not represent him as an
enemy who needs to fight in pitched battles, but as a man who comes to remove a
booty all prepared. He will not stand under arms, he will not put himself, says
the Prophet, in order of battle; but this multitude will cover the face of the
earth and will easily overcome. Then, even in the midst of anger, there is
still clemency. God does not threaten the Jews with the ruin of their capital,
he announces only exile and captivity, wanting that the punishment of those who
will be removed corrects those who remain. "He will take away from Judea
all those who can lift their heads. "All the mighty," he said,
"those who plunder and carry away everything, those who are the plagues of
the people, he will throw them into chains and slavery, so that their subjects
may breathe a little and the The fear they feel when they see others taken away
and the preservation of their own freedom makes them better. This is why he
says, "Who can do anything," that is to say, he who is strong, who
can act, who is capable of some work. And even before they are kidnapped, he
said, perhaps you will be frightened enough at the sight of this barbarian who
will cover his country with his troops. That is why he adds: "His army
will be so numerous that it will cover all your country. God is with us. Know
ye, nations, and ye shall be vanquished: Hear it to the ends of the earth, and
in spite of your strength you shall be conquered; and if you prevail a second
time, you will be defeated a second time. The designs which you have formed,
the Lord will dispel them; the words that you have spoken will have no effect,
because God is with us (8-10). "</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">I seem to prophesy here
the victory of Hezekiah, this brilliant feat of arms and its cause. If they
have, it seems, weapons, many soldiers, military experience, we have the most
powerful auxiliary, that is, God. The barbarian came, as the Prophet had made
the threat, and he went after taking many cities; but when he came back again,
he felt a very different fate. This is what the Prophet announces, as well as
the cause of this victory, and he addresses himself to the barbarians
themselves. May this first victory, he says, not make you proud, for in your
present incursion we have a powerful auxiliary. Know it then and withdraw: for
you do something impossible. Then he shows the cause of this victory, he says
that fame will publish these great deeds to the ends of the earth "Hear
him to the ends of the earth." Nobody indeed was without learning what s
then went to Jerusalem; This is why the Prophet said: "Hear him to the
ends of the earth, in spite of your strength you will be defeated. The
barbarian grew up; fame because of his power. Now, in this place he calls
strong, not those whose body is robust, but those whom the abundance of their
riches and the brilliance of their glory point out. "And if you prevail a
second time you will be defeated a second time. The designs that you form, the
Lord will dispel them; the words that you have spoken will have no effect,
because God is with us. "As their plans were evil, that they intended to
return home only after overthrowing the city from top to bottom, the Prophet
speaks of their plans and said: Everything will remain the word; Then, as the
things which he announces go beyond human nature, he resorts, in order to make
his word believe, to the greatness of the one who will accomplish everything,
and often repeats "because God is with us," and that he will dispel
all these machinations himself. To him be glory.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

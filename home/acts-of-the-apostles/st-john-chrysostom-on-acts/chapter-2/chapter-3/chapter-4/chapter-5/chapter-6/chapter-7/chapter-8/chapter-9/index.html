Lo, this was fulfilled which was spoken by Christ, that <q>they which kill you shall think they offer worship to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 16:2</font></u></a></span> He then in this wise did it, not as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>: God forbid! For that he did it through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>, is manifest from his going abroad even to strange cities: whereas they would not have cared even for those in Jerusalem; they were for one thing only, to enjoy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. But why went he to Damascus? It was a great city, a royal city: he was afraid lest that should be preoccupied. And observe his strong desire and ardor (and), how strictly according to the Law he went to work: he goes not to the governor, but <q>to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>. That if he found any of this way:</q> for so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> were called, probably because of their taking the direct way that leads to heaven. And why did he not receive authority to have them punished there, but brings them to Jerusalem! He did these things here with more authority. And mark on what a peril he casts himself. He was not afraid lest he should take any harm, but (yet) he took others also with him, <q>that if,</q> it says, <q>he found any of this way, whether they were men or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a></q>— Oh, the ruthlessness!— <q>he might bring them bound.</q> By this journey of his, he wished to show them all (how he would act): so far were they from being earnest in this matter. Observe him also casting (people) into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> before this. The others therefore did not prevail: but this man did prevail, by reason of his ardent mind. <q>And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 3, 4.)</strong> Why not in Jerusalem? Why not in Damascus? That there might be no opening for different <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to relate the occurrence in different ways, but that he alone should be the authentic narrator (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ξιόπιστος</span>), he that went for this purpose. In fact, he says this [both in his oration on the stairs], and when pleading before Agrippa. <q>Fell to the earth</q>: <span>ch. 22:6: 26:12</span> for excess of light is wont to shock, because the eyes have their measure: it is said also that excess of sound makes people deaf and stunned (as in a fit) (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ποπλἥγας</span>). But him it only blinded, and extinguished his passion by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, so that he should hear what was spoken. <q>Saul, Saul,</q> says He, <q>why do you persecute me?</q> And He tells him nothing: does not say, Believe, nor anything whatever of the kind: but expostulates with him, all but saying, What wrong, great or small, have you suffered from Me, that you do these things? <q>And he said, Who are You Lord?</q></p>

And they which were with him heard the voice of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, but saw no person to whom he answered— for (the Lord) suffered them to be hearers of what was less important. Had they heard the other Voice, they would not have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>; but perceiving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> answering (some person), they marvelled. <q>But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.</q></p>

In the same way He called the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> also a second time. <q>It shall be told you,</q> etc.: He gives him good hopes, and (intimates) that he shall recover his sight also. <q>And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus</q> </p>

<p><strong>(v. 7, 8):—</strong> the spoils of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> (<span>τὰ σκεύη αὐτοὕ</span>), <q>his goods</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat013.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 13:29</font></u></a></span>, as from some city, yea, some metropolis which has been taken. And the wonder of it is, the enemies and foes themselves brought him in, in the sight of all! <q>And for three days he neither did eat nor drink, being blinded.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:9</font></u></a></span> What could equal this? To compensate the discouragement in the matter of Stephen, here is encouragement, in the bringing in of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: though that sadness had its consolation in the fact of Stephen's making such an end, yet it also received this further consolation: moreover, the bringing in of the villages of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaritans</font></u></a> afforded very great comfort.— But why did this take place not at the very first, but after these things? That it might be shown that Christ was indeed risen. This <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">furious</font></u></a> assailant of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, the man who would not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in His death and resurrection, the persecutor of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, how should this man have become a believer, had not the power of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a> been great indeed? Be it so, that the other Apostles favored (His pretensions ): what say you to this man? Why then not immediately after His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>? That his hostility might be more clearly shown as open <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>. The man who is so frantic as even to shed blood and cast men into prisons, all at once believes! It was not enough that he had never been in Christ's company: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> must be warred upon by him with vehement hostility: he left to none the possibility of going beyond him in fury: none of them all could be so violent. But when he was blinded, then he saw the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of His sovereignty and loving kindness: then he answers, <q>Lord, what will You have me to do?</q> that none may say that he played the hypocrite, he that was even eager for blood, and went to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, and flung himself upon such dangers, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuting</font></u></a> and bringing to punishment even them that were in foreign parts— under these circumstances he now acknowledges His sovereignty. And why was he shone upon by that light not within the city, but before it? The many would not have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, since even there (at Jerusalem when the people heard the voice which came from above, they said that <q>it thundered</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh012.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 12:29</font></u></a>, <em>supra</em>, note 2, p. 123</span>; but this man was authority enough in reporting what was his own affair. And bound he was brought in, though not with bonds upon him: and they drew him, who had expected to draw the others. <q>And he eat not, neither drank:</q> he condemned himself for the past, he confessed, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>, besought God. But should any say, This was the effect of compulsion: (we answer) The same thing happened to Elymas: then how came it that he was not changed? (ch. xiii. <em>de Laud. Pauli Hom.</em> iv. §1, t. ii. p. 491.) What (evidence) could be more compulsory than the earthquake at the Resurrection, the report of the soldiers, the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, the seeing Himself risen? But these things do not compel (belief) they are calculated to teach (it) (<span>οὐκ ἀναγκαστικὰ ἀλλὰ διδακτικά</span>). Why did not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> when they were told of these things? That he spoke <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> was manifest: for he would not have been changed, had this not happened; so that all were bound to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. He was not inferior to them that preached the Resurrection, and was more credible, by being all at once converted. He had no intercourse with any of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>; it was at Damascus that he was converted, or rather before he came to Damascus that this happened to him. I ask the Jew: Say, by what was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> converted? He saw so many signs, and was not converted: his teacher (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06374b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gamaliel</font></u></a>, <em>supra</em>, p. 87, note 1) was converted, and he remained unconverted. Who convinced him— and not only convinced, but all at once inspired him with such ardent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>? Wherefore was it, that he wished even to go into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> itself for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> sake? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> of the facts is manifest.</p>
<p>But, as I said, for the present let us take shame to ourselves (when we think of) the eunuch, both in his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> and his reading.

What must he have been at home, in his leisure hours, this man who rested not even on his travels? What must he have been at night? You that are in stations of dignity, hear: imitate his freedom from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, (<em>de Lazaro, Conc.</em> iii. §3, t. i. p. 748. c) his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. Though about to return home, he did not say to himself: <q>I am going back to my country, there let me receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>;</q> those cold words which most men use! No need had he of signs, no need of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: from the Prophet merely, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. (<em>b</em>) But why is it (so ordered) that he sees (Philip) not before he goes to Jerusalem, but after he has been there? It was not meet that he should see the Apostles under <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecution</font></u></a>. Because he was yet weak, the Prophet was not easy; (but yet the Prophet) catechized him. For even now, if any of you would apply himself to the study of the Prophets, he would need no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. And, if you please, let us take in hand the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> itself. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth. (v. 22, 23.) It is likely he had heard that He was crucified, [and now he learns], that <q>His life is taken away from the earth,</q> and the rest that <q>He did no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, nor deceit in His mouth:</q> that He prevailed to save others also: [and] who He is, Whose generation is unutterable. It is likely he had seen the riven rocks there (on the spot), and (had heard) how the veil was rent, and how there was darkness, and so forth: and all these things Philip mentioned, merely taking his text from the Prophet. It is a great thing, this reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>! That was fulfilled which was spoken by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, <q>Sitting, lying down, rising up, and walking, remember the Lord your God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu006.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 6:7</font></u></a></span> For the roads, especially when they are lonely, give us opportunity for reflection, there being none to disturb us. Both this man is on the road and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> on the road: howbeit the latter no man draws, but Christ alone. This was too great a work for the Apostles: and, greater still, in that, the Apostles being at Jerusalem, and no person of authority at Damascus, he nevertheless returned thence converted: yet those at Damascus <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> that he did not come from Jerusalem converted, for he brought letters, that he might put the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> in bonds. Like a consummate Physician, when the fever was at its height, Christ brought help to him: for it was needful that he should be quelled in the midst of his frenzy. For then most of all would he be brought down, and condemn himself as one guilty of dreadful audacity. (<em>a</em>) For these things <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> deplores himself, saying, <q>Howbeit for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> I obtained mercy, that in me first <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> might show all His long suffering.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 1:13-16</font></u></a></span> Verily one has reason to admire this eunuch. He did not see Christ, he saw no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: he beheld Jerusalem standing yet entire (<span>συνεστὥτα</span>): he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> Philip. How came he to behave thus? His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> was earnest (<span>μεμεριμνημένη</span>). Yet the thief (on the cross) had seen <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>: the wise men had seen a star; but this man, nothing of the kind. So great a thing is the careful reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>! What of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> then! Did he not study the law? But he, it seems to me, was specially reserved, for the purpose which I have already mentioned by anticipation, because Christ would fain draw to Himself the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> by inducements from every quarter. For had they been in their right <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, nothing was so likely to do them good as this; for this, more than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and all else, was calculated to attract them: as, on the other hand, nothing is so apt to prove a stumbling block to men of duller minds. See then how, after the Apostle, we have God also doing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. They accused the Apostles after these [<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> of theirs]; they cast them into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>: see thereupon God doing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. For instance, the bringing them out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, was His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: the bringing Philip, His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: the bringing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> over, was His.— Observe in what way <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>, in what way the eunuch. There, Christ appears, probably because of his hardness, and because Ananias would not (else) have been persuaded. Conversant with these wonders, let us show ourselves worthy. But many in these times, even when they come to church, do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what is read; whereas the eunuch, even in public (<span>ἐ</span> <span>π᾿ ἀγορἅς</span>) and riding in his chariot, applied himself to the reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>. Not so you: none takes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Bible</font></u></a> in hand: nay, everything rather than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Bible</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Say, what are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a> for? For as much as in you lies, it is all undone. What is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> for? Tie up the Bibles: perhaps the judgment would not be such, not such the punishment: if one were to bury them in dung, that he might not hear them, he would not so insult them as you do now. For say, what is the insult there? That the man has buried them. And what here? That we do not hear them. Say, when is a person most insulted— when he is silent, and one makes no answer, or, when he does speak (and is unheeded)? So that the insult is greater in the present case, when He does speak and you will not hear: greater the contempt. <q>Speak not to us</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa030.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 30:10</font></u></a></span>, we read, they said of old to the Prophets: but you do worse, saying, Speak: we will not do. For there they turned them away that they should not even speak, as feeling that from the voice itself they got some sort of awe and obligation; whereas you, in the excess of your contempt, do not even this. Believe me, if you stopped our mouths by putting your hands over them, the insult would not be so great as it is now. For say, whether shows greater contempt, he that hears, even when hindering by this action, or, he that will not even hear? Say— if we shall look at it as a case of an insult offered— suppose one person to check the party insulting him, and to stop his mouth, as being hurt by the insults, and another person to show no concern, but pretend not even to hear them: whether will show most contempt? Would you not say the latter? For the former shows that he feels himself hit: the latter all but stops the mouth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Did ye shudder at what was said? Why, the mouth by which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> speaks, is the mouth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Just as our mouth is the mouth of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, though the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> has no mouth, so the mouth of the Prophets is the mouth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Hear, and shudder. There, common (to the whole congregation) stands the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04647c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deacon</font></u></a> crying aloud, and saying, <q>Let us attend to the reading.</q> It is the common voice of the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, the voice which he utters, and yet none does attend. After him begins the Reader, <q>The Prophecy of Esaias,</q> and still none attends, although Prophecy has nothing of man in it. Then after this, he says, <q>Thus says the Lord,</q> and still none attends. Then after this punishments and vengeances, and still even then none attends. But what is the common excuse? <q>It is always the same things over again.</q> This it is most of all, that ruins you. Suppose you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the things, even so you certainly ought not to turn away: since in the theatres also, is it not always the same things acted over again, and still you take no disgust? How dare you talk about <q>the same things,</q> you who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not so much as the names of the Prophets? Are you not ashamed to say, that this is why you do not listen, because it is <q>the same things over again,</q> while you do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the names of those who are read, and this, though always hearing the same things? You have yourself confessed that the same things are said. Were I to say this as a reason for finding fault with you, you would need to have recourse to quite a different excuse, instead of this which is the very thing you find fault with.— Do not you exhort your son? Now if he should say, <q>Always the same things!</q> would not you count it an insult? It would be time enough to talk of <q>the same things,</q> when we both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> the things, and exhibited them in our practice. Or rather, even then, the reading of them would not be superfluous. What equal to Timothy? Tell me that: and yet to him says <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, Give attention to reading, to exhortation. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 4:13</font></u></a></span> For it is not possible, I say not possible, ever to exhaust the mind of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>. It is a well which has no bottom. <q>I said,</q> says the Preacher, <q>I have become wise: and then it departed from me.</q>— <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/ecc007.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ecclesiastes 7:24</font></u></a></span> Shall I show you that the things are not <q>the same?</q> How many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, do you suppose, have spoken upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? And yet all have spoken in a way which was new and fresh. For the more one dwells on them, the more insight does he get, the more does he behold the pure light. Look, what a number of things I am going to speak of:— say, what is narrative? What is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>? What is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>? What is type? What is allegory? What is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a>? What are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? Answer me only to this one point, which is plain: why are they called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>, <q>good tidings?</q> And yet you have often heard that good news ought to have nothing sad in it: yet this <q>good news</q> has abundance of sadness in it. <q>Their fire,</q> it says, <q>shall never be quenched: their worm shall not die:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar009.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 9:44</font></u></a></span> <q>Shall appoint his portion,</q> it says, <q>with the hypocrites,</q> with them that are <q>cut asunder: then shall He say, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> you not: Depart from Me, you that work iniquity.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse51" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:51</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">7:23</font></u></a></span> Surely, we do not deceive ourselves, when we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that we tell you in your own mother-tongue (<span>good tidings? You look downcast; you are stunned; you are struck all of a heap, unable to hold up your heads. <q>Good news</q> should have nothing in it of a duty to be done, but rather should counsel what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>: whereas these <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a></q> have endless duties to be done. And again, to mention other things, as for instance, Except a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hate</font></u></a> father and mother, he is not worthy of Me <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk014.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 14:26</font></u></a></span>: and <q>I am not come to bring peace upon earth, but a sword</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:34</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk012.htm#verse51" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 12:51</font></u></a></span>: and In the world you shall have tribulation— <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 16:33</font></u></a></span> excellent good tidings these, are they not! For good news is such as this— <q>You shall have this and that good thing:</q> as in common life men say one to another, <q>What shall I have for my good news? Your father is coming, or, your mother:</q> he does not say, <q>You must do this or that.</q>— Again, tell me, how do the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a> differ from the Prophets? Why are not the Prophecies also called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>, good tidings? For they tell the same things: for instance, <q>The lame shall leap as an hart.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa035.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 35:6</font></u></a></span> <q>The Lord shall give the word to them that preach the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa067.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 68:11</font></u></a></span>: and, <q>A new heaven and a new earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa065.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 65:17</font></u></a></span> Why are not those also called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? But if, while you do not so much as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a></q> mean, you so despise the reading of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, what shall I say to you?— Let me speak of something else. Why four <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? Why not, ten? Why not twenty? If <q>many have taken in hand to set forth a narrative</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk001.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 1:1</font></u></a></span>, why not one person? Why they that were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> (i.e. Apostles)? Why they that were not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>? But why any Scriptures at all? And yet, on the contrary, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a> says, <q>I will give you a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14530a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">New Testament</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer031.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 31:31</font></u></a></span> Where are they that say, <q>Always the same things?</q> If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> these, that, though a man should live thousands of years, they are not <q>the same things,</q> ye would not say this. Believe me, I will not tell you the answers to any of these questions; not in private, not in public: only, if any find them out, I will nod assent. For this is the way we have made you good-for-nothing, by always telling you the things ready to your hands, and not refusing when we ought. Look, you have questions enough: consider them, tell me the reasons. Why <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? Why not Prophecies? Why duties, to be done, in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospels</font></u></a>? If one is at a loss, let another seek the answer, and contribute each to the others from what he has: but now we will hold our peace. For if what has been spoken has done you no good, much less would it, should we add more. We only pour water into a vessel full of holes. And the punishment too is all the greater for you. Therefore, we will hold our peace. Which that we may not have to do, it rests with yourselves. For if we shall see your diligence, perhaps we will again speak, that both ye may be more approved, and we may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> over you, in all things giving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to the God and Father of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>: to Him be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and dominion now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Acts IX. 10, 12</strong></span></p>
<p><q>And there was a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</q></p>
<p>What may be the reason that He neither drew any one of high authority and importance, nor caused such to be forthcoming for the purpose of instructing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>? It was, because it was not meet that he should be induced by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but only by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> Himself: as in fact this man taught him nothing, but merely <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> him; for, as soon as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> (<span>φωτισθείς</span>), he was to draw upon himself the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, by his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> and exceeding earnestness. And that Ananias was no very distinguished person, is plain. For, <q>the Lord,</q> it says, <q>spoke unto him in a vision, and Ananias answered and said, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> he has done to Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> at Jerusalem.</q> </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:13</font></u></a></span> For if he spoke in objection to Him, much more would he have done so, had He sent an Angel. And this is why, in the former instance, neither is Philip told what the matter is; but he sees the Angel, and then the Spirit bids him go near to the chariot. But observe here how the Lord relieves him of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>: <q>He is blind,</q> says He, <q>and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, and are you afraid?</q> In the same way <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> also is afraid: so that the words betokened that he was afraid, and shrunk from the task, not that he did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>.

And observe, He speaks not to him of the success achieved: teaching us not to speak of our achievements. And, though He saw him afraid, for all this He said it not. <q>You shall not be disbelieved:</q> <q>he has seen,</q> says He, <q>in a vision a man (named) Ananias:</q> for this is why it was <q>in a vision,</q> namely, because he was blind. And not even the exceeding wonderfulness of the thing took possession of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, so greatly was he afraid. But observe: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> being blind, in this way He restored to sight. <q>But the Lord said unto him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, and kings, and the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>: for I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 15, 16.)</strong> <q>Not only,</q> says He, shall he be a believer, but even a teacher, and great boldness shall he show: 'before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and kings'— such shall be the spread of the doctrine!— that just as He astonished (him) by the former, so He may (startle him even more) by the latter. <q>And Ananias went, and entered into the house, and laid his hands upon him, and said, Brother Saul</q>— he straightway addresses him as a friend by that name— <q>Jesus, Who appeared unto you in the way in which you came</q>— and yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> had not told him this, but he learned it from the Spirit— <q>has sent me unto you, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q></p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:8</font></u></a></span> which was just his case in respect of the Law, until the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07421a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Name of Jesus</font></u></a> was put on him. <q>And he received sight immediately, and arose, and was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>.

Wishing therefore to deepen his dejection, He made the man blind until the coming of Ananias: and, that he might not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> the blindness to be (only) fancy, this is the reason of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scales</font></u></a>.

And straightway in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a> he preached Jesus, that He is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>

He was not ashamed of the change, was not afraid while the very things in which he was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> afore-time, the same he destroyed. Even from his first appearance on the stage here was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, death-dealing, ready for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> of blood: do you see what a manifest sign (was here)? And with this very thing, he put all in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>: for, said they, Hither also is he come for this very thing. <q>But all that heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>? But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 21, 22.)</strong> As one learned in the Law, he stopped their mouths, and suffered them not to speak. They thought they were rid of disputation in such matters, in getting rid of Stephen, and they found another, more vehement than Stephen. </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> But let us look at what relates to Ananias. The Lord said not to him, Converse with him, and catechize him. For if, when He said, <q>He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, and has seen a man laying his hands upon him,</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <strong>(v. 11, 12.)</strong> He did not persuade him, much less had He said this. So that he shall not disbelieve you, <q>he has seen in a vision.</q> Observe how in the former instance neither is Philip told all immediately. Fear not, He says: for this man is a chosen vessel for Me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:15</font></u></a></span> He more than sufficiently released him of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, if the case be so that this man shall be so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a> in our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, as even to suffer many things. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> he is called <q>a vessel</q> (or, instrument)— for reason shows that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is not a physical quality: <q>a vessel of election</q> (or, chosen instrument), He says; for we choose that which is approved. And let not any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a>, that (Ananias) speaks in unbelief of what was told him, as imagining that Christ was deceived: far from it! But affrighted and trembling, he did not even attend to what was said, at hearing the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>. Moreover, the Lord does not tell that He has blinded him: at the mention of his name <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> had prepossessed his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: <q>see,</q> he says, <q>to whom You are betraying me: 'and hither for this very purpose is he come, to bind all that call upon Your Name.' I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, lest he take me to Jerusalem: why dost Thou cast me into the mouth of the lion?</q> He is terrified, even while he speaks these words; that from every quarter we may learn the energetic character (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ρετήν</span>) of the man. For that these things should be spoken by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, were nothing wonderful: but that these (the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>) are so terrified, it is a most mighty <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of the power of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> is shown, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> greater after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. For there was indeed need of strength. Since He says, <q>a vessel of election,</q> that you may not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that God is to do all, He adds, to bear My Name before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and kings, and the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>. Ananias has heard what he most desired— that against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> also he will take his stand: this above all gave him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a>. <q>For I,</q> says He, <q>will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name's sake.</q> At the same time also this is said by way of putting Ananias to the blush: If he, that was so frantic, shall suffer all things, and thou not willing even to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptize</font></u></a> him! <q>It is well,</q> says he: <q>let him continue blind</q> (this is why he says these words): <q>he is blind: why dost Thou at all bid me open his eyes, that he may bind (men) again?</q> Fear not the future: for that opening of his eyes he will use not against you, but for you (with reference to that saying, <q>That he may receive his sight</q></p>

And immediately he added, wishing to draw a veil over the accusation: <q>That you may receive your sight.</q> I came not to reprove the past, but to bestow the gift: <q>that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> <em>(a)</em> With hands laid on, he spoke these words. <q>And immediately there fell from his eyes,</q> etc.</span></p>

<p><span> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:18</font></u></a></span>: a double blindness is removed.— And why says it, <q>Having taken food, he was strengthened?</q></span></p>

<p><span><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:19</font></u></a></span> Because they that are in such case become relaxed: he had no heart to partake of food before, until he obtained the mighty gifts. <em>(c)</em> It seems to me, that both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> and Cornelius, at the very instant when the words were spoken, received the Spirit.

And at the same time (the Lord) both teaches him to think modestly of himself, in that He does not bring him to the Apostles who were so admired, and shows that there is nothing of man here. He was not filled, however, with the Spirit which works signs: that in this way also his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> might be shown; for he wrought no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. <q>And straightway,</q> it says, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a> he preached Jesus</q>—</span></p>

And it was well they did this: the consequence being, that he showed himself to the Apostles in Jerusalem. Now they sent him out, as bound to provide for his safety by flight: but he did just the contrary— he leaped into the midst of those who were mad against him. This it is to be on fire, this to be fervent indeed! From that day forth he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> all the commands which the Apostles had heard: <q>Except a man take up his cross, and follow Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse38" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:38</font></u></a></span> The very fact that he had been slower to come than the rest made him more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealous</font></u></a>: for <q>to whom much is forgiven</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk007.htm#verse47" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 7:47</font></u></a></span> the same will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> more, so that the later he came, the more he loved: * * * and having done ten thousand wrongs, he thought he could never do enough to cast the former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> into the shade. <q>Proving</q></p>

And observe, they did not say to him, You are he that destroyed: why are you changed? For they were ashamed: but they said it to themselves. For he would have said to them, This very thing ought to teach you, as in fact he does thus plead in his speech before Agrippa. Let us imitate this, man: let us bear our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> in our hands ready to confront all dangers.— (That he fled from Damascus) this was no cowardice: he preserved himself for the preaching. Had he been a coward, he would not have gone to Jerusalem, would not immediately have commenced teaching: he would have abated somewhat of his vehemence: for he had been taught by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a> of Stephen. He was no coward, but he was also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudent</font></u></a> (<span>οἰκονομικός</span>) (in husbanding himself). Wherefore he thought it no great thing to die for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel's</font></u></a> sake, unless he should do this to great advantage: willing not even to see Christ, Whom most of all he longed to see, while the work of his stewardship among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> was not yet complete. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi001.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 1:23-24</font></u></a></span>. Such ought to be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>. From his first appearance from the very outset, the character of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> declared itself: nay even before this, even in the things which he did <q>not according to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:2</font></u></a></span>, it was not by man's reasoning that he was moved to act as he did. For if, so long afterwards, he was content not to depart, much more at the beginning of his trading voyage, when he had but just left the harbor! Many things Christ leaves to be done by (ordinary) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> wisdom, that we may learn that (his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>) were men, that it was not all everywhere to be done by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>: for otherwise they would have been mere motionless logs: but in many things they managed matters themselves.— This is not less than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrdom</font></u></a>—to shrink from no suffering for the sake of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of the many. Nothing so delights God. Again will I repeat what I have often said: and I repeat it, because I do exceedingly desire it: as Christ also did the same, when discoursing concerning forgiveness: <q>When ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, forgive if you have anything against any man:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar011.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 11:25</font></u></a></span> and again to Peter He said, <q>I say not unto you, Forgive until seven times, but until seventy-times seven.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:22</font></u></a></span> And Himself in fact forgives the transgressions against Him. So do we also, because we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that this is the very goal of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christianity</font></u></a>, continually discourse thereof. Nothing is more frigid than a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, who cares not for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of others. You can not here plead poverty: for she that cast down the two mites, shall be your accuser. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk021.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 21:1</font></u></a></span> And Peter said, <q>Silver and gold have I none.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 3:6</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> was so poor, that he was often hungered, and wanted necessary food. You can not plead lowness of birth: for they too were ignoble men, and of ignoble <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a>. You can not allege want of education: for they too were <q>unlearned men.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:13</font></u></a></span> Even if you be a slave therefore and a runaway slave, you can perform your part: for such was Onesimus: yet see to what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> calls him, and to how great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> he advances him: <q>that he may communicate with me,</q> he says, <q>in my bonds.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phm001.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philemon 13</font></u></a></span> You can not plead infirmity: for such was Timothy, having often infirmities; for, says the apostle, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:23</font></u></a></span> Every one can profit his neighbor, if he will fulfil his part. See ye not the unfruitful trees, how strong they are, how fair, how large also, and smooth, and of great height? But if we had a garden; we should much rather have pomegranates, or fruitful olive trees: for the others are for delight to the eye, not for profit, which in them is but small. Such are those men who only consider their own interest: nay, not such even since these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are fit only for burning: whereas those trees are useful both for building and for the safety of those within. Such too were those Virgins, chaste indeed, and decent, and modest, but profitable to none <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:1</font></u></a></span> wherefore they are burned. Such are they who have not nourished Christ. For observe that none of those are charged with particular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of their own, with fornication, for instance, or with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>; in short, with no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> but the having been of no use to another. Such was he who buried his talent, showing indeed a blameless life, but not being useful to another. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:25</font></u></a></span> How can such an one be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>? Say, if the leaven being mixed up with the flour did not change the whole into its own nature, would such a thing be leaven? Again, if a perfume shed no sweet odor on those who approach it, could we call it a perfume? Say not, <q>It is impossible for me to induce others (to become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>)</q>— for if you are a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, it is impossible but that it should be so. For as the natural properties of things cannot be gainsaid, so it is here: the thing is part of the very nature of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>. Do not insult God. To say, that the sun cannot shine, would be to insult Him: to say that a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> cannot do good, is to insult <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and call Him a liar. For it is easier for the sun not to give heat, nor to shine, than for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> not to send forth light: it is easier for the light to be darkness, than for this to be so. Tell me not that it is impossible: the contrary is the impossible. Do not insult God. If we once get our own affairs in a right state, the other will certainly follow as a natural and necessary consequence. It is not possible for the light of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> to be hid; not possible for a lamp so conspicuous as that to be concealed. Let us not be careless. For, as the profit from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> reaches both to ourselves, and to those who are benefited by it: so from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> there is a two-fold loss, reaching both to ourselves, and to those who are injured by it. Let there be (if you will) some private man, who has suffered numberless ills from some one, and let no one take his part, yet let that man still return good offices; what teaching so mighty as this? What words, or what exhortations could equal it? What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> were it not enough to extinguish and soften? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> therefore these things, let us hold fast to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that it is not possible to be saved otherwise, than by passing through this present life in doing these good works, that we may also obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things which are to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>: but they were all afraid of him, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> not that he was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way.</q></p>
<p>One may well be much at a loss here to understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, <q>I went not to Jerusalem,</q> but <q>into Arabia</q> and <q>to Damascus,</q> and, <q>After three years I went up to Jerusalem,</q> and <q>to see Peter</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal001.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"></a></span><u><font color="#0000ff">, (<span>ἱ</span> <span>στορἥσαι</span> Cat.) here the writer says the contrary.

Certainly of his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210121.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accord</font></u></a> he went not to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210121.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Apostles</font></u></a>, but <q>assayed to join himself unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a></q>— as being a teacher, not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>— <q>I went not,</q> he says, <q>for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learned nothing from them.</q> Or, he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, <q>I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Syria</font></u></a>:</q> or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Cæsarea. Also, the visit <q>after fourteen years,</q> probably, was when he brought up the [<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> to the] brethren together with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210121.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Barnabas</font></u></a>: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal002.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"></a></span><u><font color="#0000ff">or else he means a different occasion. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act011.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow">Acts 11:30</a></span></font></u> For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate <span>related in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act022.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 22:17-21</font></u></a></span> that vision, but passes it by. <q>He assayed,</q> it says, <q>to join himself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. And they were afraid of him.</q> By this again is shown the ardor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: <q>they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> not that he was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>:</q> for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> that was beyond all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> expectation. He was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, as being a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. He was not thought worthy of credit. <q>But Barnabas</q>— <q>Son of Consolation</q> is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for <q>he was a kind man</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act011.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 11:24</font></u></a></span>, exceedingly, and this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)— <q>having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act015.htm#verse39" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 15:39</font></u></a></span> It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence <em>he</em> was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. <q>How,</q> it says, <q>he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:28</font></u></a></span>: these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. <q>And he spoke, and disputed with the Hellenists.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:29</font></u></a></span> So then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. <q>With the Hellenists:</q> he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. <q>But they,</q> it says, <q>went about to slay him:</q> a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Cæsarea. For it says, <q>When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:30</font></u></a></span>, at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> way; so to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, much more in theirs. Then, it says, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> throughout all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galilee</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaria</font></u></a> had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:31</font></u></a></span> He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, he first says this. For while there was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecution</font></u></a>, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> departed, and there was peace: there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and immediately, peace! See what that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaria</font></u></a>, Simon was put to shame: in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. <q>And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> which dwelt at Lydda.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:32</font></u></a></span> Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> were to be told, that these were <q>not drunken,</q> when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he <span>ch. 1:15; 2:15; 3:4-12; 4:8; 5:3-15</span>: when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good management (was needed); but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> (than the others). When need was to work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. <q>And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, Æneas, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 33, 34.)</strong> And why did he not wait for the man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. <q>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:35</font></u></a></span> For the man was notable. <q>Arise, and make your bed:</q> he does well to give a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: for they not only released men of their diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also. Moreover, at that time they had given no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of their power, so that the man could not reasonably have been required to show his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, as neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 3:6</font></u></a></span> As therefore Christ in the beginning of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> did not demand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but reasonable, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of the parties was first shown; <q>they brought out their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least might fall upon some of them</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:15</font></u></a></span>; for many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> had been wrought there; but here this is the first that occurs. For of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, some were wrought for the purpose of drawing others (to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>); some for the comfort of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. <q>Now there was at Joppa a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> was full of good works and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">almsdeeds</font></u></a> which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:36-38</font></u></a></span>. Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (<span>ἐ</span> <span>σκύλη</span>) before this? So right-minded (<span>φιλοσοφοὕντες</span>) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (<span>σκύλλειν</span>) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. <q>Not to delay to come unto them:</q> for she was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he had come, they led him into the upper chamber.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse39" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:39</font></u></a></span> They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (<span>σωτηρίαν</span>.) See what a cheering inducement to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> is here! <q>And all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</q> Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman's</font></u></a> name, but to show that the name she bore (<span>φερώνυμος ἦν</span>) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. <q>She was full,</q> it says, <q>of good works:</q> not only of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, but <q>of good works,</q> first, and then of this good work in particular. <q>Which,</q> it says, <q>Dorcas made while she was with them.</q> Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. <q>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</q> </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:40</font></u></a></span> Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. <q>And having knelt down, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>.</q> Observe the intentness of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> <q>And he gave her his hand.</q></p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:27</font></u></a></span>— it seems to me that Barnabas was of old a friend of his— <q>and related,</q> etc.: observe how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says nothing of all this himself: nor would he have brought it forward to the others, had he not been compelled to do so. <q>And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord Jesus</font></u></a>.</q> (v. 28, 29.)

And this (departure) is Providentially ordered, that he might preach there also: and so likewise were the plots against him ordered by God's Providence, and his coming to Jerusalem, that the story about him might no longer be disbelieved. For there he was <q>speaking boldly,</q> it says, <q>in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists;</q> and again, <q>he was with them coming in and going out.— So the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> throughout all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galilee</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaria</font></u></a> had peace</q>— i.e. it increased: and peace with itself, that peace which is peace indeed: for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> from without would have done them no harm — <q>they being edified, and walking in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the Lord, and abounded in the consolation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> And the spirit consoled them both by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and by the works, and independently of these in the person of each individual. <q>And it came to pass, etc. And Peter said unto him, Eneas,</q> etc.</p>

But let us so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> them, as if we were now beholding them. It is not simply said, that Tabitha died, but that she died, having been in a state of weakness. And (yet) they did not call Peter until she died; then <q>they sent and told him not to delay to come unto them.</q> Observe, they send and call him by others. And he comes: he did not think it a piece of disrespect, to be summoned by two men: for, it says, <q>they sent two men unto him.</q>— Affliction, my beloved, is a great thing, and rivets our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> together. Not a word of wailing there, nor of mourning. See how thoroughly matters are cleansed! <q>Having washed her,</q> it says, <q>they laid her in an upper chamber:</q> that is, they did all (that was right) for the dead body. Then Peter having come, <q>knelt down, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>; and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, arise.</q></p>

But this was profitable for them: for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> God took thought not only for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of others, but for their own. He that healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that he now has to do so much first? There are cases also in which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of the applicants coöperated. This is the first dead person that he raises. Observe how he, as it were, awakes her out of sleep: first she opened her eyes: then upon seeing (Peter) she sat up: then from his hand she received strength. <q>And it was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> throughout all Joppa, and many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in the Lord.</q></p>

<p>For where tears are— or rather, where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> are, there tears ought not to be; not where such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> is celebrating. Hear, I beseech you: although somewhat of the like kind does not take place now, yet in the case of our dead likewise, a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> is celebrating. Say, if as we sit together, the Emperor were to send and invite some one of us to the palace, would it be right, I ask, to weep and mourn? Angels are present, commissioned from heaven and come from thence, sent from the King Himself to call their fellow servant, and say, do you weep? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> it is that is taking place, how awful, how dread, and worthy indeed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hymns</font></u></a> and lauds? Would you learn, that you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, that this is no time for tears? For it is a very great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> of the Wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. As if leaving her dwelling, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> goes forth, speeding on her way to her own Lord, and do you mourn? Why then, you should do this on the birth of a child: for this in fact is also a birth, and a better than that. For here she goes forth to a very different light, is loosed as from a prison-house, comes off as from a contest. <q>Yes,</q> say you, <q>it is all very well to say this, in the case of those of whose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> we are assured.</q> Then, what ails you, O man, that even in the case of such, thou dost not take it in this way? Say, what can you have to condemn in the little child? Why do you mourn for it? What in the newly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>? For he too is brought into the same condition: why do you mourn for him? For as the sun arises clear and bright, so the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, leaving the body with a pure <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, shines joyously. Not such the spectacle of Emperor as he comes in state to take possession of the city (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιβαίνοντα πόλεως</span>), not such the hush of awe, as when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> having quitted the body is departing in company with Angels. Think what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> must then be! In what amazement, what wonder, what delight! Why do you mourn? Answer me.— But it is only in the case of sinners you do this? Would that it were so, and I would not forbid your mournings, would that this were the object! This lamentation were Apostolic, this were after the pattern of the Lord; for even Jesus wept over Jerusalem. I would that your mournings were discriminated by this rule. But when you speak the words of one that would call back (the dead), and speakest of your long intimacy and his beneficence, it is but for this you mourn (not because he was a sinner), thou dost but pretend to say it. Mourn, bewail the sinner, and I too will give a loose to tears; I, more than thou, the greater the punishment to which he is liable as such: I too will lament, with such an object. But not thou alone must lament him that is such; the whole city must do the same, and all that meet you on the way, as men bewail them that are led to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">put to death</font></u></a>. For this is a death indeed, an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> death, the death of sinners. But (with you) all is clean reversed. Such lamentation marks a lofty <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and conveys much instruction; the other marks a littleness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. If we all lamented with this sort of lamentation, we should amend the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> themselves while yet living. For as, if it rested with you to apply medicines which would prevent that bodily death, you would use them, just so now, if <em>this</em> death were the death you lament, you would prevent its taking place, both in yourself and in him. Whereas now our behavior is a perfect riddle; that having it in our power to hinder its coming, we let it take place, and mourn over it when it has come. Worthy indeed of lamentations are they (when we consider), what time as they shall stand before the judgment seat of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, what words they shall then hear, what they shall suffer! To no purpose have these men lived: nay, not to no purpose, but to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> purpose! Of them too it may be fitly said, <q>It were good for them had they never been born.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar014.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 14:21</font></u></a></span> For what profit is it, I ask, to have spent so much time to the hurt of his own person? Had it been spent only to no purpose, were not that, I ask you, punishment enough! If one who has been an hired servant twenty years were to find that he has had all his labor in vain, would he not weep and lament, and think himself the most miserable of men? Why, here is a man who has lost all the labor of a whole life: not one day has he lived for himself, but to luxury, to debauchery, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. Then, say, shall we not bewail this man? Shall we not try to snatch him from his perils? For it is, yes, it is possible, if we will, to mitigate his punishment, if we make continual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> for him, if for him we give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. However unworthy he may be, God will yield to our importunity. For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> showed mercy on one (who had no claims on his mercy), and for the sake of others spared one (whom he would not have spared), much more is it right for us to do this. By means of his substance, by means of your own, by what means you will, aid him: pour in oil, nay rather, water. Has he no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">almsdeeds</font></u></a> of his own to exhibit? Let him have at least those of his kindred. Has he none done by himself? At least let him have those which are done for him, that his wife may with confidence beg him off in that day, having paid down the ransom for him. The more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> he has to answer for, the greater need has he of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, not only for this reason, but because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> has not the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> now, but far less: for it is not all one to have done it himself, and to have another do it for him; therefore, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> being less, let us by quantity make it the greatest. Let us not busy ourselves about monuments, not about memorials. This is the greatest memorial: set <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a> to stand around him. Tell them his name: bid them all make for him their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, their supplications: this will overcome God: though it have not been done by the man himself, yet because of him another is the author of the almsgiving. Even this pertains to the mercy of God: <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a> standing around and weeping</q> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to rescue, not indeed from the present death, but from that which is to come. Many have profited even by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> done by others on their behalf: for even if they have not got perfect (deliverance), at least they have found some comfort thence. If it be not so, how are children saved? And yet there, the children themselves contribute nothing, but their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> do all: and often have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> had their children given them, though the children themselves contributed nothing. Many are the ways God gives us to be saved, only let us not be negligent.</p>
<p>How then if one be poor? Say you. Again I say, the greatness of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> is not estimated by the quantity given, but by the purpose. Only give not less than your ability, and you have paid all. How then, say you, if he be desolate and a stranger, and have none to care for him? And why is it that he has none, I ask you? In this very thing you suffer your desert, that you have none to be thus your friend, thus <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>. This is so ordered on purpose that, though we be not ourselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, we may study to have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> companions and friends— both wife, and son, and friend— as reaping some good even through them, a slight gain indeed, but yet a gain. If you make it your chief object not to marry a rich wife, but to have a devout wife, and a religious daughter, you shall gain this consolation; if you study to have your son not rich but devout, you shall also gain this consolation. If you make these your objects then wilt yourself be such as they. This also is part of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, to choose such friends, and such a wife and children. Not in vain are the oblations made for the departed, not in vain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, not in vain the almsdeeds: all those things has the Spirit ordered, wishing us to be benefited one by the other. See: he is benefited, you are benefited: because of him, you have despised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, being set on to do some generous act: both you are the means of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> to him, and he to you the occasion of your almsgiving. Doubt not that he shall get some good thereby. It is not for nothing that the Deacon cries, <q>For them that are fallen asleep in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and for them that make the memorials for them.</q> It is not the Deacon that utters this voice, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>: I speak of the Gift. What do you say? There is the Sacrifice in hand, and all things laid out duly ordered: Angels are there present, Archangels, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> is there: all stand with such awe, and in the general silence those stand by, crying aloud: and do you think that what is done, is done in vain? Then is not the rest also all in vain, both the oblations made for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and those for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, and for the whole body? God forbid! But all is done with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. What do you think of the oblation made for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a>, of the calling made in that hour, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a> though they be, yet even <q>for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a>?</q> It is a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to be named in the presence of the Lord, when that memorial is celebrating, the dread Sacrifice, the unutterable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>. For just as, so long as the Emperor is seated, is the time for the petitioner to effect what he wishes to effect, but when he is risen, say what he will, it is all in vain, so at that time, while the celebration of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> is going on, it is for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> the greatest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to be held worthy of mention. For look: then is declared the dread <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>, that God gave Himself for the world: along with that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> he seasonably puts Him in mind of them that have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>. For as when the celebration of Emperor.' victories is in progress, then, as many as had their part in the victory receive their meed of praise, while at the same time as many as are in bonds are set at liberty in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of the occasion; but when the occasion is past, he that did not obtain this favor then, no longer gets any: so is it here likewise: this is the time of celebration of a victory. For, says it, <q>so often as you eat this bread, you do show forth the Lord's death.</q> Then let us not approach indifferently, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that these things are done in any ordinary sort. But it is in another sense that we make mention of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a>, and this, for assurance that the Lord is not dead: and this, for a sign that death has received its death's blow, that death itself is dead. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Knowing</font></u></a> these things, let us devise what consolations we can for the departed, instead of tears, instead of laments, instead of tombs, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, our oblations, that both they and we may attain unto the promised blessings, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-kindness of His only-begotten Son <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, dominion, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

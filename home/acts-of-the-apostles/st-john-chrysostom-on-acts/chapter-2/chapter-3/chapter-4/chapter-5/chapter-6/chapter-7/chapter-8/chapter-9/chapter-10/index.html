<p><q>There was a certain man in Cæsarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> to the people, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> to God always. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> have come up for a memorial before God.</q></p>
<p>This man is not a Jew, nor of those under the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210122.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Law</font></u></a>, but he had already forestalled our manner of life. Observe, thus far, two <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, both of high rank, receiving the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, the eunuch at Gaza and this man; and the pains taken on behalf of these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210122.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>. But do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that this was because of their high rank: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210122.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> forbid! It was because of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. For that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> mentions their dignified stations, is to show the greatness of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>; since it is more wonderful when a person being in a position of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and power is such as these were. What makes the praise of the former is, his undertaking so long a journey, and this when there was no (festival) season to require it, and his reading on his road, and while riding in his chariot, and his beseeching Philip, and numberless other points: and the great praise of the latter is, that he makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, and is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">just</font></u></a> man, holding such a command. The reason why the writer describes the man so fully, is, that none may say that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> history relates falsehoods: <q>Cornelius,</q> he says, <q>a centurion of the band called the Italian band.</q></p>

As indeed on many occasions we find Christ Himself hasting (to such), as being more infirm. Or (it may be) because (Cornelius) was not able himself to leave his home. But here again is a high commendation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, just as was there given by means of Tabitha. <q>A devout man,</q> it says, <q>and one that feared God with all his house.</q> Let us hear this, whoever of us neglect them of our own house, whereas this man was careful of his soldiers also. <q>And that gave <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>to all the people.</q> Both his doctrines and his life were right. <q>He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</q></p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:3</font></u></a></span> Why does he see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>? This also was in order to the full assurance of Peter, or rather, not of him, but of the others, the weaker ones. <q>At the ninth hour,</q> when he was released from his cares and was at quiet, when he was engaged in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and compunction. <q>And when he looked on him, he was afraid.</q> </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:4</font></u></a></span> Observe how what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> speaks he does not speak immediately, but first rouses and elevates his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>. At the sight, there was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> in moderation, just so far as served to fix his attention. Then also the words relieved him of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> roused him: the praise mitigated what was unpleasant in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. <q>Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> have come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.</q></p>

<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:6</font></u></a></span> Do you mark how the Apostles, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of solitude and quiet, affected the retired quarters of the cities? <q>With one Simon a tanner:</q> how then if it chanced that there was another? Behold, there is another token, his dwelling by the seaside. All three tokens could not possibly coincide (elsewhere). He does not tell him for what purpose, that he may not take off the intense desire, but he leaves him to an eager and longing expectation of what he shall hear. <q>And when the Angel which spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</q> (v. 7, 8.) Do you see, that it is not without purpose that the writer says this? (it shows) that those also <q>who waited on him continually</q> were such as he. <q>And when he had declared the whole matter unto them:</q> observe the unassuming character of the man: for he does not say, Call Peter to me: but, in order also to induce him to come, he declared the whole matter:— this was so ordered by Providence;— for he did not choose to use the authority of his rank to fetch Peter to him; therefore <q>he declared the matter;</q> such was the moderation of the man: and yet no great notion was to be formed of one lodging with a tanner. <q>And on the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew near to the city</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:10</font></u></a></span> What means this expression, <span>ἔ</span> <span>κστασις</span>, <q>trance?</q> Rather, there was presented to him a kind of spiritual view (<span>θεωρία</span>): the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, so to say, was caused to be out of the body (<span>ἐ</span> <span>ξέστη</span>). <q>And saw heaven opened, and, knit at the four corners, a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</q></p>

The earth then, this is what the linen sheet denotes, and the wild beasts in it, are they of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, and the command, <q>Kill and eat,</q> denotes that he must go to them also; and that this thing is thrice done, denotes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>. <q>What God has cleansed,</q> says it, <q>call not thou common.</q> Great daring! Wherefore did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, this is why he says, <q>Not so, Lord,</q> etc. not gainsaying— just as to Philip also He said, <q>How many loaves do you have?</q> Not to learn, but tempting, or <q>proving him.</q> And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also <q>all the four-footed beasts of the earth:</q> the clean with the unclean. And for all this, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not what it meant. <q>Now while Peter <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter,</q> it says, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> in himself</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <strong>(v. 17, 18)</strong>, the men come at the right moment to solve his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and then sends the Angel: for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they <q>asked whether he were lodging there. While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek you. Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</q> (<em>supra</em>, p. 142, and 145, note 7; v. 19, 20.) And this again is a plea for Peter in answer to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, that he did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, and was instructed to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> nothing. <q>For I,</q> says He, <q>have sent them.</q> Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God does, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, <q>Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> have ascended, for a memorial before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, <q>And now send men,</q> etc.: the Spirit not so, but, <q>For I have sent them. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> wherefore you have come? And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">just</font></u></a> man, and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, was warned from God by an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 21, 22.)</strong> They speak his praises, so as to persuade him that an Angel has in fact appeared unto him. <q>Then called he them in,</q> <em>(b)</em> that they may suffer no harm, <q>and lodged them:</q> thenceforth he without scruple takes his meals with them. <q>And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Cæsarea accompanied him. And the morrow after, they entered into Cæsarea.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">(v. 23, 24.)</font></strong> The man was a person of note, and it was in a city of note that he then was.</p>
<p>(a) But let us look over again what has been said. <q>There was a certain man in Cæsarea,</q> etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation, v. 1, 2.)</font></strong> Observe with whom the beginning of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> is made— with <q>a devout man,</q> and one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> to be worthy by his works. For if, though the case be so, they are still offended, if this had not been the case, what would not have been the consequence! But mark the greatness of the assurance. <em>(c)</em> To this end all is done (in the way it is done), and the affair takes its beginning from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>. <em>(d)</em> <q>He saw in a vision, evidently,</q> etc.</p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:3</font></u></a></span>. It was not in his sleep that the Angel appeared to him, but while he was awake, in the daytime, <q>about the ninth hour. He saw an Angel of God coming in unto him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid.</q> So occupied was he with himself. Implying, that it was in consequence of the Angel's calling him by a voice that he saw him; as, had he not called him, he would not have seen him: so taken up was he with the act in which he was engaged. But the Angel says to him, <q>Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> have come up for a memorial before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, who is called Peter.</q></p>

So, neither does Peter relate the whole matter, but everywhere, the narratives are in part only, for the purpose of making the hearers apply their minds to what is said. <q>Send and call for Simon:</q> in like manner the Angel only calls Philip. <q>And as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:9</font></u></a></span>: in order that Peter should not be in perplexity too long. <q>Peter went up upon the housetop,</q> etc. Observe, that not even his hunger forced him to have recourse to the sheet. <q>Rise, Peter,</q> says the Voice, <q>kill and eat.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>

That the thing taking place was of God (the circumstances made evident, namely), both that he sees it (descending) from above, and that he is in a trance; and, that the voice comes from thence, and the thrice confessing that the creatures there were unclean, and its coming from thence, and being drawn back there (all this), is a mighty token of the cleanness (imparted to them).— But why is this done? For the sake of those thereafter, to whom he is about to relate it. For to himself it had been said, <q>Go not into the way of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:5</font></u></a></span> * * For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> needed both (to give) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, and (to offer) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, much more (was some assurance needed) then, in the beginning of the Preaching, while they were as yet weaker. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:3</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act021.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">21:16</font></u></a></span>— Observe too how he did not at once receive them. For, it says, they <q>called, and asked, whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.</q></p>

And he does not say, For to this end did the vision appear unto you; but, <q>I have sent them. Then Peter went down</q></p>

For it is sufficient for all assurance to be told by Him, This do, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>: nothing more (is needed)— <q>Then Peter went down, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> wherefore you have come?</q> He saw a soldier, saw a man: it was not that he was afraid, on the contrary, having first confessed that he was the person whom they sought, then he asks for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> (of their coming); that it may not be supposed that the reason of his asking the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, was, that he wished to hide himself: (he asks it) in order, that if it be immediately urgent, he may also go forth with them, but if not, may receive them as guests. <q>And they said, etc. into his house.</q></p>

<p>See how great the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, both in the former discourse, and here!

Such are the pains taken for the bringing of Cornelius to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, that both an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> is sent, and the Spirit works, and the chief of the Apostles is fetched to him, and such a vision is shown, and, in short, nothing is left undone. How many centurions were there not besides, and tribunes, and kings, and none of them obtained what this man did! Hear, all you that are in military commands, all you that stand beside kings. <q>A just man,</q> it says, <q>fearing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; devout</q> (v. 2, and 22); and what is more than all, with all his house. Not as we (who): that our servants may be afraid of us, do everything. but not that they may be devout. And over the domestics too, so * *. Not so this man; but he was <q>one that feared God with all his house</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:2</font></u></a></span>, for he was as the common father of those with him, and of all the others (under his command.) But observe what (the soldier) says himself. For, fearing * *, he adds this also: <q>well reported of by all the nation.</q> For what if he was uncircumcised? Nay, but those give him a good report. Nothing like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>: great is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of this practice, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> is poured forth from pure stores; for it is like a fountain discharging mud, when it issues from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a> stores, but when from just gains, it is as a limpid and pure stream in a paradise, sweet to the sight, sweet to the touch, both light and cool, when given in the noon-day heat. Such is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. Beside this fountain, not poplars and pines, nor cypresses, but other plants than these, and far better, of goodly stature: friendship with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, praise with men, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to Godward, good-will from all; blotting out of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, great boldness, contempt of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. This is the fountain by which the plant of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is nourished: for nothing is so wont to nourish <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, as the being merciful: it makes its branches to lift themselves on high. This fountain is better than that in Paradise <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 2:10</font></u></a></span>; a fountain, not dividing into four heads, but reaching unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> itself: this gives birth to that river <q>which springs up into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 4:14</font></u></a></span>: on this let Death light, and like a spark it is extinguished by the fountain: such, wherever it drops, are the mighty blessings it causes. This quenches, even as a spark, the river of fire: this so strangles that worm, as naught else can do. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar009.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 9:44</font></u></a></span> He that has this, shall not gnash his teeth. Of the water of this, let there be dropped upon the chains, and it dissolves them: let it but touch the firebrands, it quenches all.— A fountain does not give out streams for a while and anon run dry—else must it be no more a fountain—but ever gushes: so let our fountain give out more copiously of the streams of mercy (in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>). This cheers him that receives: this is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, to give out not only a copious, but a perennial, stream. If you would that God rain down His mercy upon you as from fountains, have thou also a fountain. And yet there is no comparison (between God's fountain and yours): for if you open the mouths of this fountain, such are the mouths of God's Fountain as to surpass every abyss. God does but seek to get an opportunity on our part, and pours forth from His storehouses His blessings. When He expends, when He lavishes, then is He rich, then is He affluent. Large is the mouth of that fountain: pure and limpid its water. If you stop not up the fountain here, neither will you stop up that fountain.— Let no unfruitful tree stand beside it, that it may not waste its spray. Have you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>? Plant not poplars there: for such is luxury: it consumes much, and shows nothing for it in itself, but spoils the fruit. Plant not a pine-tree— such is wantonness in apparel, beautiful only to the sight, and useful for nothing— nor yet a fir-tree, nor any other of such trees as consume indeed, but are in no sort useful. Set it thick with young shoots: plant all that is fruitful, in the hands of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, all that you will. Nothing richer than this ground. Though small the reach of the hand, yet the tree it plants starts up to heaven and stands firm. This it is to plant. For that which is planted on the earth will perish, though not now, at any rate a hundred years hence. Thou plantest many trees, of which you shall not enjoy the fruit, but ere you can enjoy it, death comes upon you. This tree will give you its fruit then, when you are dead.— If you plant, plant not in the maw of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gluttony</font></u></a>, that the fruit end not in the draught-house: but plant thou in the pinched belly, that the fruit may start up to heaven. Refresh the straightened <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, lest you pinch your own roomy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>.— See you not, that the plants which are over-much watered at the root decay, but grow when watered in moderation? Thus also drench not thou your own belly, that the root of the tree decay not: water that which is thirsty, that it may bear fruit. If you water in moderation, the sun will not wither them, but if in excess, then it withers them: such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the sun. In all things, excess is bad; wherefore let us cut it off, that we also may obtain the things we ask for.— Fountains, it is said, rise on the most elevated spots.

<p><strong>Acts X. 23, 24</strong></p>
<p><q>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</q></p>
<p><q>He</q> called them in, and lodged them. Good, that first he gives the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> friendly treatment, after the fatigue of their journey, and makes them at home with him; <q>and on the morrow,</q> sets out with them.

Of course (his <q>near</q> friends), those in whom he had ever full confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind. <q>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</q></p>

And he said unto them, You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</q> (v. 27, 28.) Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and points out to them that it is a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210123.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any (such), have come to you: but what says he? <q>You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a></q>— God commanded this — <q>that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation.</q> Then he goes on to say, <q>And to me God has shown</q>— this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him— <q>that I should call no man</q>— that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, <q>no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> being,</q> says he— <q>common or unclean.</q></p>

What then does Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell you? But observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, <q>From the fourth day I was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a> until this hour; and at the ninth hour I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> is heard, and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> have come up for a memorial before God.

It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a life under stricter rule, and on certain days. For this is why he he says, <q>From the fourth day.</q> See how great a thing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a> is!

But whether a person be such, God only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>. See how this man was acceptable: see how, as soon as he heard, he was persuaded. <q>Yes, and now too,</q> say you, <q>every one would be persuaded, be who he may.</q> But the signs that are now, are much greater than those, and more wonderful.— Then Peter commences his teaching, and reserves for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> the privilege of their birth. <q>The word,</q> he says, which He sent unto the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, preaching peace</p>

Do you see how far they are from hiding the Cross out of view, nay, that together with the other circumstances they put also the manner? <q>Whom also,</q> it says, <q>they slew by hanging on a tree.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 39, 41.)</strong> See whence he fetches his assurance of the resurrection. What is the reason that being risen he did no sign, but only ate and drank? Because the Resurrection itself was a great sign, and of this nothing was so much a sign as the eating and drinking. <q>To testify,</q> says he— in a manner calculated to alarm— that they may not have it in their power to fall back upon the excuse of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>: and he does not say, <q>that He is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>,</q> but, what would most alarm them, <q>that it is He which is ordained of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, to be the Judge of quick and dead.</q></p>

Better to be buried ten thousand times over, than that God through us should be so spoken of! The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, we read, said to (Christ) Himself, <q>Thou that destroyest the Temple, and in three days buildest it up, come down from the Cross</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat027.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 27:40</font></u></a></span>: and again, <q>If Thou be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>:</q> but the reproaches here are more grievous than those, that through us He should be called a teacher of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>! Let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> the very opposite to be said, by having our conversation worthy of Him that calls us, and (worthily) approaching to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> of adoption. For great indeed is the might of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> (<span>φωτίσματου</span>): it makes them quite other men than they were, that partake of the gift; it does not let the men be men (and nothing more). Make thou the Gentile (<span>τὸν slave, like a malefactor, as though it were not your duty to live unto God? Why do you stand affected to Him, as if you had in Him a ruthless, cruel Master? What can be more heartless (<span>ψυχρότερον</span>), what more miserable, than those who make that the time to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>? God made you a friend, and vouchsafed you all His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, that you may act the part of a friend. Suppose you had done some man the greatest of wrongs, had insulted him, and brought upon him disgraces without end, suppose you had fallen into the hands of the person wronged, and he, in return for all this, had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> you, made you partaker of all that he had, and in the assembly of his friends, of those in whose presence he was insulted, had crowned you, and declared that he would hold you as his own begotten son, and then straightway had died: say, would you not have bewailed him? Would you not have deemed his death a calamity? Would you not have said, Would that he were alive, that I might have it in my power to make the fit return, that I might requite him, that I might show myself not base to my benefactor? So then, where it is but man, this is how you would act; and where it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, are you eager to be gone, that you may not requite your benefactor for so great gifts? Nay rather, choose the time for coming to Him so that you shall have it in your power to requite Him like for like. True, say you, but I cannot keep (the gift). Has God commanded impossibilities? Hence it is that all is clean reversed, hence that, all the world over, every thing is marred— because nobody makes it his mark to live after God. Thus those who are yet Catechumens, because they make this their object, (how they may defer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> to the last,) give themselves no concern about leading an upright life: and those who have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> (<span>φωτισθεντες</span>), whether it be because they received it as children, or whether it be that having received it in sickness, and afterwards recovered (<span>ἀ</span> <span>νενεγκόντες</span>), they had no hearty desire to live on (to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of God), so it is, that neither do these make an earnest business of it: nay, even such as received it in health, have little enough to show of any good impression, and warmly affected for the time, these also presently let the fire go out. Why do you flee? Why do you tremble? What is it you are afraid of? You do not mean to say that you are not permitted to follow your business? I do not part you from your wife! No, it is from fornication that I bar you. I do not debar you from the enjoyment of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>? No, but from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> and rapacity. I do not oblige you to empty out all your coffers? No, but to give some small matter according to your means to them that lack, your superfluities to their need, and not even this unrewarded. We do not urge you to fast? We do but forbid you to besot yourselves with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a> and gormandizing. The things we would retrench are but the very things which bring you disgrace; things which even here, on this side of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell-fire</font></u></a>, you yourselves confess to be things to be shunned and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>. We do not forbid you to be glad and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>? Nay, only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> not with a disgraceful and unbecoming merriment. What is it you dread, why are you afraid, why do you tremble? Where marriage is, where enjoyment of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, where food in moderation, what matter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is there in these things? And yet, they that are without enjoin the opposites to these, and are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a>. For they demand not according to your means, but they say, You must give thus much: and if you allege poverty, they will make no account of that. Not so Christ: Give, says He, of what you have, and I inscribe you in the first rank. Again those say, If you will distinguish yourself, forsake father, mother, kindred, friends, and keep close attendance on the Palace, laboring, toiling, slaving, distracted, suffering miseries without number. Not so Christ; but keep thou, says He, at home with your wife, with your children, and as for your daily occupations reform and regulate them on the plan of leading a peaceable life, free from cares and from perils. True, say you, but the other promises <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. Aye, but Christ a kingdom, and more, He promises <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> also with it. For, <q>Seek ye,</q> says He, <q>the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and all these things shall be added unto you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:33</font></u></a></span>: throwing in, by way of additional boon, what the other holds out as the main thing: and the Psalmist says, he has <q>never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa036.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 37:25</font></u></a></span> Let us set about practising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, let us make a beginning; let us only lay hold on it, and you shall see what the good will be. For surely in these (worldly) objects you do not succeed so without labor, that you should be so faint-hearted for these (higher) objects— that you should say, Those are to be had without labor, these only with toil. Nay,— what need to tell you what is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> state of the case?— those are had only with greater labor. Let us not recoil from the Divine Mysteries, I beseech you. Look not at this, that one who was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> before you, has turned out ill, and has fallen from his hope: since among soldiers also we see some not doing their duty by the service, while we see others distinguishing themselves, and we do not look only at the idle ones, but we emulate these, the men who are successful. But besides, consider how many, after their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>, have of men become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>!</span></p>
<p>Fear the uncertainty of the future. <q>As a thief in the night,</q> so death comes: and not merely as a thief, but while we sleep it sets upon us, and carries us off while we are idling. To this end has God made the future uncertain, that we may spend our time in the practice of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, because of the uncertainty of expectation. But He is merciful, say you. How long shall we hear this senseless, ridiculous talk? <em>I</em> affirm not only that God is merciful, but that nothing can be more merciful than He, and that He orders all things concerning us for our good. How many all their life do you see afflicted with the worst form of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprosy</font></u></a>! (<span>ἐ</span> <span>ν ἐλέφαντι διάγοντας</span>, <q>Elephantiasis,</q>) how many blind from their earliest youth even to old age! Others who have lost their eyesight, others in poverty, others in bonds, others again in the mines, others entombed (<span>καταχωσθέντας</span>) together, others (slaughtered) in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>! These things say you, do not look like mercy. Say, could He not have prevented these things had He wished, yet He permits them? True, say you. Say, those who are blind from their infancy, why are they so? I will not tell you, until you promise me to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a>, and, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>, to live aright. It is not right to give you the solution of these questions. The preaching is not meant just for amusement. For even if I solve this, on the back of this follows another question: of such questions there is a bottomless deep. Therefore do not get into a habit of looking to have them solved for you: else we shall never stop questioning. For look, if I solve this, I do but lead the way to question upon question, numberless as the snowflakes. So that this is what we learn, rather to raise questions, not to solve the questions that are raised. For even if we do solve them, we have not solved them altogether, but (only) as far as man's reasoning goes. The proper solution of such questions is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that God does all things <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> and mercifully and for the best: that to comprehend the reason of them is impossible. This is the one solution, and another better than this exists not. For say, what is the use of having a question solved? This, that one needs no longer to make a question of the thing which is solved. And if you get yourself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> this, that all things are ordered by the Providence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, Who, for reasons <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to Himself, permits some things and actively works others, you are rid of the need of questioning, and hast gotten the gain of the solution. But let us come back to our subject. Do you not see such numbers of men suffering chastisements? God (say you) permits these things to be. Make the right use of the health of the body, in order to the health of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. But you will say, What is the use to me of labors and toil, when it is in my power to get quit of all (my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>) without labor? In the first place, this is not certain. It may happen, that a person not only does not get quit of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> without labor, but that he departs hence with all his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> upon him. However, even if this were certain, still your argument is not to be tolerated. He has drawn you to the contests: the golden arms lie there. When you ought to take them, and to handle them, you wish to be ingloriously saved, and to do no good work! Say, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> broke out, and the Emperor were here, and you saw some charging into the midst of the phalanxes of the enemy, hewing them down, dealing wounds by thousands, others thrusting (with the sword's point), others hounding (now here, now there), others dashing on horseback, and these praised by the Emperor, admired, applauded, crowned: others on the contrary thinking themselves well off if they take no harm, and keeping in the hindmost ranks, and sitting idly there; then after the close of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, the former sort summoned, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> with the greatest gifts, their names proclaimed by the heralds: while of the latter, not even the name becomes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>, and their reward of the good obtained is only that they are safe: which sort would you wish to belong to? Why, if you were made of stone, if you were more stupid even than senseless and lifeless things, would you not ten thousand times rather belong to the former? Yea, I beseech and implore you. For if need were to fall fighting, ought you not eagerly to choose this? See you not how it is with them that have fallen in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>, how illustrious they are, how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>? And yet they die a death, after which there is no getting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> from the emperor. But in that other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, there is nothing of the kind, but you shall in any wise be presented with your scars. Which scars, even without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecutions</font></u></a>, may it be granted all us to have to exhibit, through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> our Lord, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, dominion, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Acts X. 44, 46</strong></p>
<p><q>While Peter yet spoke these words, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a> which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> also was poured out the gift of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.</q></p>
<p>Observe God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a> management. He does not suffer the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">speech</font></u></a> to be finished, nor the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> to take place upon a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">command</font></u></a> of Peter, but, when He has made it evident how admirable their state of mind is, and a beginning is made of the work of teaching, and they have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> that assuredly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> is the remission of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, then immediately comes the Spirit upon them. Now this is done by God's so disposing it as to provide for Peter a mighty ground of justification. And it is not simply that the Spirit came upon them, but, <q>they spoke with tongues:</q> which was the thing that astonished those who had come together. They altogether disliked the matter, wherefore it is that the whole is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and as for Peter, it may almost be said, that he is present only to be taught (with them) the lesson, that they must take the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> in hand, and that they themselves are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> by whom this must be done. For whereas after all these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">great events</font></u></a>, still both in Cæsarea and in Jerusalem a questioning is made about it, how would it have been if these (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210124.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tokens</font></u></a>) had not gone step by step with the progress of the affair? Therefore it is that this is carried to a sort of excess. Peter seizes his advantage, and see the plea he makes of it. <q>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>, which have received the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> as well as we?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse47" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:47</font></u></a></span> Mark the issue to which he brings it; how he has been travailing to bring this forth. So (entirely) was he of this mind! Can any one, he asks, <q>forbid water?</q> It is the language, we may almost say, of one triumphantly pressing his advantage (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πεμβαίνοντος</span>) against such as would forbid, such as should say that this ought not to be. The whole thing, he says, is complete, the most essential part of the business, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> with which we were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>. <q>And he commanded them to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse48" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:48</font></u></a></span> After he has cleared himself, then, and not before, he commands them to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>: teaching them by the facts themselves. Such was the dislike the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> had to it! Therefore it is that he first clears himself, although the very facts cry aloud, and then gives the command. <q>Then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> they him</q>— well might they do so— <q>to tarry certain days:</q> and with a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> thenceforth he does tarry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> He does not say that Peter was astonished, but, <q>They of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>:</q> since he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> what was in preparation. And yet they ought to have marvelled at this, how they themselves had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. When they heard that they had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, they were not astonished, but when God gave them the Spirit. Then <q>answered Peter and said,</q> etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act010.htm#verse47" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 10:47</font></u></a></span> And therefore it is that he says, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has shown that I should not call common or unclean any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> being.</q></p>

What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> henceforth? They were no longer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, the Truth having come. It is nothing wonderful, he says, if before the act of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptism</font></u></a> they received the Spirit: in our own case this same happened. Peter shows that not as the rest either were they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>, but in a much better way. This is the reason why the thing takes place in this manner, that they may have nothing to say, but even in this way may account them equal with themselves.</p></div>

For this reason Stephen too begins his speech in a tone of gentleness, and says, <q>Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> appeared unto our father <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran.</q></div>

Mark then how these threads make the texture of the whole speech: and moreover that having evermore enjoyed exceeding goodness, they still requited their Benefactor with the opposite conduct, and that they are now attempting impossibilities. <q>The God of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> appeared unto our father <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he came into Charran.</q> Both the temple was not, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> was not, and yet a vision of God was vouchsafed to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and yet had he Persians for his ancestors, and was in a strange land.

Hence we learn, that it was in consequence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> vision, that his father was moved to join in the migration. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen011.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 11:31</font></u></a></span> <q>And said unto him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into a land which I shall show you.</q></div>

And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on.</q> (v. 4, 5.) See how he raises their thoughts away from (their possession of) the land. For if He said (that, He will give: clearly [all came from him], and nothing from themselves. For he came, having left both kindred and country. Wherefore then did He not give it to him? Truly it was a figure of another land. <q>And He promised to give it to him.</q> Do you perceive, that he does not merely resume the thread of his discourse? <q>He gave him not,</q> says he; <q>and He promised; and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</q> Again, what God can do: that out of impossibilities, He does all. For here is a man in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Persia</font></u></a>, so far away, and this man God says He will make lord of Palestine.

<div>Whence, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, did that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> bloom upon the countenance of Stephen? </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> The writer gives him this report above, that he was <q>full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:8</font></u></a></span>. For it is possible to have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> that does not consist in works of healing: For to one is given the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co012.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 12:8-9</font></u></a></span> in such and such wise (<span>τοιὣσδε</span>). But here, it seems to me, it says that he was also gracious to look at: <q>They saw his face as it had been the face of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>.</q> <q>Full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and of power</q>: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:15</font></u></a></span> which is also the character given of Barnabas <q>he was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> man, full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act011.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 11:24</font></u></a></span> Whence we learn that the sincere and innocent are, above all others, the men to be saved, and that these same are also more gracious. <q>Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemous</font></u></a> words.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:11</font></u></a></span> In the case of the Apostles they were annoyed that they preached the Resurrection, and that much people flowed unto them: but in this case, that they were getting their diseases healed. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:2</font></u></a></span> The things for which they ought to give thanks, they made matter of blame: O the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>! The men who overcame them by works, they expected to overcome by words! It is just what they did in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, and always they forced them to words. For they were ashamed to seize them without more ado, having nothing to charge them with. And observe, not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> themselves who bring them to judgment bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> against them; for they would have been refuted: but they simply hire others, that it may not seem to be an act of mere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>. It is all of a piece with their proceeding in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. And observe the power of the preaching, that, though they are not only scourged but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>, it still prevails: not only, private individuals as they are, dragged to the bar, but assailed from all quarters: and, their enemies themselves being witnesses, not only were these worsted, but <q>they were not able</q> even <q>to resist</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:10</font></u></a></span>, though they were exceeding shameless: so mightily did it overthrow them, for all that they could do with their preposterous figments (as the saying that He had a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>— He that cast out devils!). For the battle was not man's, but God's against men. And there were many combined together; not only they in Jerusalem, but others as well. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:9</font></u></a></span> For <q>we have heard him,</q> say they, <q>speaking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemous</font></u></a> words against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> and against God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:11</font></u></a></span> O you shameless ones!

This is why <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> is added— because the things of God were no great concern to them: and it is ever and always <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> that they make mention of: <q>This <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, which brought us out.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act007.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 7:40</font></u></a></span> <q>And they stirred up the people.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:12</font></u></a></span> Fickleness of the multitude! And yet how could a man who was a blasphemer have so succeeded? How could a blasphemer work such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> among the people? But the undisciplined multitude made them strong who had the worst of it (in argument).— This was what most annoyed them. <q>We have heard him,</q> they say, <q>speaking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemous</font></u></a> words against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> and against God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:13</font></u></a></span>: and again, <q>This man ceases not to speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemous</font></u></a> words against this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> place and the law,</q> and with an addition, <q>the customs</q> <q>which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> delivered to us</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:14</font></u></a></span>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, not God. Upon the supposition of a design to overturn their manner of life (<span>πολιτείας</span>), they accused him of impiety also. But to show that it was not in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of such a man to speak such things, and harshly [<q>Then all,</q> it says, <q>which were in the council, looking steadfastly upon him, saw his face, as it had been the face of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a></q>] <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 6:15</font></u></a></span>: so mild was he even in countenance. For, in cases where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> were not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> accused, Scripture mentions nothing of this kind: but as in this case it was all false accusation, with reason does God rectify it by the very look of the man. For the Apostles indeed were not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> accused, but were forbidden: but this man is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsely</font></u></a> accused: and therefore before all else his countenance pleads for him.

<p>These things having seen, let us likewise, whatever God shall promise, receive the same, however contrary may be the events. And yet in our case, they are not contrary, but very suitable. For where the promises are, there, when the contraries turn out, they are really contrary; but in our case it is just the reverse: for He has told us that we should have tribulation here, but our rest there. Why do we confound the times? Why do we turn things upside down? Say, are you afflicted, and livest in poverty, and in dejection? Be not troubled: for it were worth being troubled at, were thou destined to be afflicted in that world: as for this present affliction, it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of rest. <q>This sickness,</q> says He, <q>is not unto death.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh011.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 11:4</font></u></a></span> That affliction is punishment: this, schooling and correction. It is a contest, this life present: if so, to fight is our business now: it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and battle. In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> one does not seek to have rest, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> one does not seek to have dainty living, one is not anxious about riches, one's care is not about a wife then: one thing only he looks at, how he may overcome his foes. Be this our care likewise: if we overcome, and return with the victory, God will give us all things. Be this alone our study, how we may overcome the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: though after all it is not our own study that does it, but God's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> does the whole business. Be it our one study, how we may attract His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, how we may draw to ourselves that assistance. <q>If God be for us, who can be against us?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom008.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 8:31</font></u></a></span> Let us make one thing our study; that He be not our enemy, that He turn not away from us.</p>
<p>Not the being afflicted is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. This is the sore affliction, however we may pass our days in luxury:— not to speak of the life to come, it is so even in this life present. Think how our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> is stung with remorse, and whether this is not worse than any kind of torture! I should like to put the question searchingly to those who live in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> ways (<span>ἐ</span> <span>ν κακοἵς</span>), whether they never come to reflect upon their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, whether they do not tremble, and are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and anguish, whether they do not think those blessed who live in abstinence, them of the mountains, them of the strict rule? (<span>τοὺς ἐν πολλῇ φιλοσοφί&amp; 139Apostles rejoiced when scourged. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> gives this exhortation, saying, <q>Rejoice in the Lord.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 4:4</font></u></a></span> And how can there be rejoicing, where there are bonds, where there are tortures; where there are courts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>? There, most of all, is rejoicing. But say, how can there be rejoicing, where these are not? For he who is conscious of no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, will have a sort of exceeding delight, insomuch that in what degree you speak of tribulation, in the same you tell of his delight. The soldier who has received numberless wounds and has come home again, will he not return with exceeding delight, with his wounds as his title for speaking up boldly, and as evidence of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> and renown? And thou, if you be able to exclaim as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> does, <q>I bear the marks of Jesus</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal006.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 6:17</font></u></a></span>, will be able to become great and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> and renowned. <q>But there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecution</font></u></a>.</q> Make your stand against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>: and should any one speak anything against you, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> not to be evil-spoken of for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> sake: make your stand against the tyranny of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, against the fighting of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, against the torment of concupiscence. These also are <q>marks,</q> these also are torments. For, I ask, what is the worst in tortures? Is it not, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is pained, and is on fire? For in the other case, the body too has its share: but in this, the whole belongs to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. On the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> alone comes all the smart, when one is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, when one is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, whatever else of this kind one does, or rather suffers. For, in fact, it is not action, but passion, not a doing, but a suffering— to be angered, to feel <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>: therefore indeed they are called <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> (or sufferings) (<span>πάθη</span>, <em>perturbationes</em>) of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, yea wounds, and bruises. For it is indeed a suffering, and worse than suffering. Bethink you, you that are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, that you do such things in <q>passion,</q> in a state of suffering. Therefore he who is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> suffers not. Do you mark that not he who is abused is the sufferer, but he that abuses, as I said above? For that he is a sufferer, is plain in the first place from the very fact, that such a thing is called by this name of passion: and it is also plain from the (effects on the) body: for these are the affections (<span>πάθη</span>) for <q>sufferings,</q> as we call them] engendered by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, viz. dimness of vision, insanity, and numberless others. <q>But he insulted my boy,</q> say you; <q>but [he called him] clown.</q> Deem it not weakness your not doing the same thing yourself. For, I ask you, was it well done? You will not say that: then leave that undone which being done were not well done. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> are engendered in such cases. <q>But,</q> say you, <q>how if he despise me, how if he say it again?</q> Show him that he is in the wrong: rebuke him, entreat him: by meekness <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> is put down: go and expostulate with him. For though in cases of wrong done to ourselves it is right not to do even this, yet it is quite necessary to do it in behalf of others. Do not look on it as an insult to yourself that your boy has been insulted: annoyed you may be for his sake, yet not as if you were insulted: for it does not follow because your boy has been ill-treated, that you are disgraced, but he is disgraced that did the ill. Quench (your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>) that sharp sword: let it lie in its scabbard. If we have it unsheathed, we shall be apt to use it even when the time is not proper, being drawn on by it: but if it be hidden, though a necessity should arise, yet, while we seek it in order to draw it, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> will be quenched. Christ would not have us be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> on his account: (hear what He says to Peter: <q>Put up again your sword into the sheath:</q>) <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat026.htm#verse52" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 26:52</font></u></a></span> and are you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> on account of a boy?

Alas! That it is not in the power of words to bring it home to people in the way that it is possible to be taught it by actual experience! And that you may learn this; stand between two combatants, take part with the wronged, not with the wrong-doers [that you may learn] whether you shall not see the victory on your side, whether you shall not get splendid crowns.— See, how God is insulted, and how He answers; how gently, <q>Where,</q> says He, <q>is Abel your brother?</q> and what says the other: <q>Am I my brother's keeper?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 6:9</font></u></a></span> What could be more contumacious than this?

These things I say, not only in order that towards men we may be gentle, but also if a wife be a talker, that you may bear it: let your wife be to you a school for training and exercise (<span>παλαίστρα καὶ γυμνάσιον</span>). For how can it but be absurd, to submit to exercises which yield no profit, where we afflict the body, but not to practise exercises at home, which, even before the contest, present to us a crown? Does your wife abuse you? Do not thou become a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>: to be abusive is womanly: it is a disease of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, an inferiority. Think not that it is unworthy of you, when your wife abuses you. Unworthy it is, when you are abusive, but she bears patiently (<span>φιλοσοφῇ</span>): then do you act unseemly, then are you disgraced: but if, having been abused, thou bear it, great is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of your strength. I do not say this, to induce wives to be abusive: God forbid: but only in case it should so happen at the instance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>. It is the part of men that are strong, to bear the weak. And if your servant contradict you, bear it philosophically: not what he deserves to have said to him, do thou say or do, but that which it behooves you both to do and to say. Never insult a girl by uttering some foul word against her: never call your servant, scoundrel (<span>μιαρὸν</span>): not he is disgraced, but thou. It is not possible to be master of one's self, being in a passion. Like a sea rolling mountains high, it is all hurly-burly: or even as a pure fountain, when mire is cast into it, becomes muddied, and all is in turmoil. You may beat him, you may rend his coat to rags, but it is you that sustain the greater damage: for to him the blow is on the body and the garment, but to you on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. It is your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that you have cut open; it is there that you have inflicted a wound: you have flung your own charioteer from his horses, you have got him dragging along the ground upon his back. And it is all one, as if one driver being in a passion with another, should choose to be thus dragged along. You may rebuke, you may chide, you may do whatever if be, only let it be without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> and passion. For if he who rebukes is physician to him who offends, how can he heal another, when he has first hurt himself, when he does not heal himself? Say, if a physician should go to heal another person, does he first wound his own hand, first blind his own eyes, and so set about healing that other? God forbid. So also, however thou rebuke, however thou chide, let your eyes see clearly. Do not make your mind muddy, else how shall the cure be wrought? It is not possible to be in the same tranquillity, being in a passion, and being free from passion. Why do you first overturn your master from his seat, and then discourse with him as he lies sprawling on the ground? Do you see not the judges, how, when about to hold the assize, they seat themselves upon the bench, in their becoming attire? Thus do thou likewise dress your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> with the judicial robe (which is gentleness). <q>But he will not be afraid of me,</q> say you. He will be the more afraid. In the other case, though you speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>, your servant will impute it to passion: but if you do it with gentleness, he will condemn himself: and, what is of the first importance, God will accept you, and thus you will be able to attain unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> blessings, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, dominion, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</span></p>

<p><q>And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> four hundred years. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve Me in this place.</q></p>
<div>See, what a number of years the Promise has been given, and the manner of the Promise, and nowhere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, nowhere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>! He here shows, how God Himself suffered them to be afflicted, not that He had anything to lay to their charge. <q>And they shall bring them into bondage,</q> etc. But nevertheless, they did not these things with impunity. <q>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God.</q> For, to show that they are not to go by this, in estimating who are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pious</font></u></a> (by reason of their saying, <q>He trusted in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, let Him deliver Him,</q>) <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat027.htm#verse43" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 27:43</font></u></a></span>.— He, the Same that promised, He that gave the land, first permits the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>.

If here the freedom was not to be till after four hundred years, what wonder, with regard to the Kingdom? Yet he performed it, and lapse of time availed not to falsify His word. Moreover, it was no ordinary bondage they underwent. And the matter does not terminate solely in the punishment of those (their oppressors); but they themselves also, He says, shall enjoy a mighty <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. Here he reminds them too of the benefit which they enjoyed. <q>And he gave him the covenant of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>: and so he begot Isaac.</q> Here he lets himself down to lower <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210116.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">matters</font></u></a>. <q>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> him on the eighth day: and Isaac (begot) Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</q> </div>

Though they had no fault to find with him, and though he came on purpose to bring them their food, they thus ill-treated him.

But when Jacob heard that there was grain in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, he sent out our fathers first.

They came down to buy, and had to depend upon him for everything. What then did he? [<q>He made himself <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to his brethren:</q>] not to this point only did he carry his friendliness; he also made them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>, and brought them down into the land. <q>And Joseph's kindred was made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>. Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. So Jacob went down into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, and died, he, and our fathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. But when the time of the promise drew near, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> the people grew and multiplied in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05329b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Egypt</font></u></a>, till another king arose, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not Joseph.</q></div>

Then again, fresh disappointment (<span>ἀ</span> <span>νελπιστία</span>): first, famine, but they came through that: secondly, the falling into the hands of their enemy: thirdly, the being destroyed by the king. Then (to show) God's fullness of ways and means (<span>εὐμήχανον</span>), <q>In which time,</q> it says, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> was born, and was exceeding fair.</q></div>

Do you observe all along a figurative enacting, so to say, of the resurrection of the dead? But it is not the same thing for God himself to do a thing, and for a thing to come to pass in connection with man's purpose (<span>προαίρεσις</span>).

Then again he shows how ungrateful they were to their benefactor. For, just as in the former instance, they were saved by the injured Joseph, so here again they were saved by another injured person, I mean, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. <q>And when he was full forty years old,</q> etc. For what though they killed him not actually? In intention they did kill, as did the others in the former case. There, they sold out of their own into a strange land: here, they drive from one strange land into another strange land: in the former case, one in the act of bringing them food; in this, one in the act of giving them good counsel; one to whom, under <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the man was indebted for his life!

A famine, and it did not consume them: nor was this all: but they were saved by means of the very person, whom they had expected to be destroyed (by their means). A royal edict, and it did not consume them: nay then most did their number increase, when he was dead <q>who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a></q> them. Their own Saviour they wished to kill, but for all that, they had not power to do it. Do you observe, that by the means whereby the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> tried to bring to naught the promise of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, by those very means it was advanced?</div>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is suitable to be said here also: that God is rich in ways and means to bring us up from hence. For this above all showed the riches of God's resources, that in its very reverses (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ποστροφῇ</span>) the nation increased, while enslaved, while evil-entreated, and sought to be exterminated. And this is the greatness of the Promise. For had it increased in its own land, it had not been so wonderful. And besides, it was not for a short time, either, that they were in the strange land: but for four hundred years. Hence we learn a (great lesson) of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> endurance (<span>φιλοσοφίαν</span>):— they did not treat them as masters use slaves, but as enemies and tyrants— and he foretold that they should be set in great liberty: for this is the meaning of that expression, <q>They shall serve (Me): and they shall come up hither again</q> (<span>ἐ</span> <span>νταὕθα ἐπανελεύσονται</span>); and with impunity. — And observe, how, while he seems to concede something to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, he in fact allows it nothing</div>

Thus also does Christ in His death give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of His power: thus also does He there reign as king where they sold Him. <q>And gave him favor and wisdom,</q> etc.</div>

For when he was an exile, when a stranger, when he had now passed much time in a foreign land, so as to have two sons, when he no longer expected to return, then does the Angel appear to him. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> he calls an Angel, as also he calls Him man.

That God is everywhere present, they learned.</div>
<p>Hearing these things, let us in our afflictions flee to Him. <q>And their groaning,</q> says He, <q>I have heard:</q> not simply, <q>because of their calamities.</q> But if any should ask, Why then did He suffer them to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> entreated there? Why, in the first place, to every just man his sufferings are the causes of his rewards. And in the next place, as to why He afflicted them: it was to show His power, that He can (do all), and not only so, but that He may also train them. Observe in fact; when they were in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04749a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">desert</font></u></a>, then they <q>waxed fat, they grew thick, they spread out in breadth, they kicked</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu032.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 32:15</font></u></a></span>: and ever and always ease was an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. Therefore also from the beginning He said to Adam: <q>In the sweat of your face you shall eat your bread.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen003.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 3:19</font></u></a></span> Also (it was) in order that having come out of much suffering into rest, they might give thanks to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For affliction is a great good. For hear the Prophet saying, <q>It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for me, that You have humbled me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa118.htm#verse71" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 119:71</font></u></a></span> But if to great and wonderful men affliction be a great (good), much more to us. And, if you will, let us examine into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of affliction as it is in itself. Let there be some person rejoicing exceedingly, and gay, and giving a loose to jollity: what more unseemly, what more senseless than this? Let there be one sorrowing and dejected: what more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> than this? For, <q>It is better,</q> we read, <q>to go into the house of mourning, than into the house of laughter.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/ecc007.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ecclesiastes 7:2</font></u></a></span> But, likely enough, you do not like the saying, and want to evade it. Let us however see, what sort of man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01129a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Adam</font></u></a> was in Paradise, and what he was afterwards: what sort of man Cain was before, and what he was afterwards. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> does not stand fast in its proper place, but, like as by a running tide, (<span>ῥ</span> <span>εύματος</span>, Edd. <span>πνεύματος</span>, <q>wind</q>) is raised and buoyed up by pleasure, having no steadfastness; facile in making professions, prompt at promising; the thoughts all in restless commotion: laughter ill-timed, causeless hilarity, idle clatter of unmeaning talk. And why speak of others? Let us take in hand some one of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, and let us see what he was while in pleasure, what again, when in distress. Shall we look at David himself? When he was in pleasure and rejoicing, from his many trophies, from his victory, from his crowns, from his luxurious living, from his confidence, see what sort of things he said and did: <q>But I said in my prosperity,</q> says he, <q>I shall never be moved.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa029.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 30:6</font></u></a></span> But when he has come to be in affliction, hear what he says: <q>And if He say to me, I have no mind for you; lo! Here am I, let Him do that which is pleasing in His sight.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2sa015.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Samuel 15:26</font></u></a></span> What can be more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> than these words? <q>Whatsoever may be pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>so let it be.</q> And again he said to Saul: <q>If the Lord stirs you up against me, may your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> be acceptable.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa026.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 26:19</font></u></a></span> And then too, being in affliction, he spared even his enemies: but afterwards, not friends even, nor those who had done him no injury. Again, Jacob when he was in affliction, said: <q>If the Lord will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen028.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 28:20</font></u></a></span> As also the son of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11088a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Noah</font></u></a> did nothing of the kind erewhile; but when he was no longer afraid for his safety, you hear how wanton he became. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen009.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 9:22</font></u></a></span> Hezekiah too, when he was in affliction, see what things he did in order to his deliverance; he put on sackcloth, and such like; but when he was in pleasure, he fell through the haughtiness of his heart. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ki019.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Kings 19:20</font></u></a></span> For, says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>, <q>When you have eaten, and drunk, and art filled, take heed to yourself.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu006.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 6:11-12</font></u></a></span> For perilous, as on a precipice's brink, is the post of affluence. <q>Take heed,</q> says he, <q>to yourself.</q> When the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a> were afflicted, they became all the more increased in number: but when He left them to themselves, then they all went to ruin. And why speak of examples from the ancients? In our own times, let us see, if you please, is it not the case, that when the most are in good case, they become puffed up, hostile to everybody, passionate, while the power is with them: but if it be taken away, they are gentle, lowly (and as) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> beings, are brought to a consciousness of their own natural condition.

<p>Now these things I have spoken, that we should not make enjoyment every way our object. How then does <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> say, <q>Rejoice always?</q> He does not say simply, <q>Rejoice,</q> but he adds, <q>in the Lord.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 4:4</font></u></a></span> This is the greatest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, such as the Apostles rejoiced withal; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> of which prisons, and scourges, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecutions</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> report, and all painful things, are the source, and the root, and the occasion; whence also it comes to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> issue. But that of the world, on the contrary, begins with sweets and ends in bitters. Neither do I forbid to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord</font></u></a>, nay, I earnestly exhort to this. The Apostles were scourged, and they rejoiced: were bound, and they gave thanks: were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>, and they preached. This is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> I also would have: from nothing bodily has it its origin, but from spiritual things. It is not possible for him who joys after the fashion of the world, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> also after a godly sort: for every one who joys after the world's fashion, has his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> in riches, in luxury, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, in power, in arrogance: but he who rejoices after the mind of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, has his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> in dishonor for God's sake, in poverty, in want, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fasting</font></u></a>, in humbleness of mind. Do you see, how opposite are the grounds (of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>)? To go without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> here, is to be without grief also: and to be without grief here, is to go without pleasure too. And in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> these are the things which produce real <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, since the others have the name only of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, but they altogether consist of pain. What misery the arrogant man endures! How is he cut short (<span>διακόπτεται</span>) in the midst of his arrogance, bespeaking for himself numberless insults, much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>, great enmity, exceeding spite, and many an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> eye! Whether it be that he is insulted by greater men, he grieves: or that he cannot make his stand against everybody, he is mortified. Whereas the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> man lives in much enjoyment: expecting <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> from none, if he receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, he is pleased, but if not, he is not grieved. He takes it contentedly that he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>; but above all, none dishonors him. Now not to seek <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and yet to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>— great must be the enjoyment of this. But in the other, it is just the reverse: he seeks <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>. And the pleasure that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> gives is not the same to him who seeks it, as it is to him who seeks it not. The one, however much he receives, thinks he has received nothing: the other, though you give him ever so little, takes it as though he had received all. Then again, he who lives in affluence and luxury has numberless affairs of business, and let his revenues flow in to him ever so easily, and, as it were, from full fountains, yet he fears the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> arising from luxurious living, and the uncertainty of the future: but the other is always in a state of security and enjoyment, having accustomed himself to scantiness of diet. For he does not so bemoan himself at not partaking of a sumptuous board, as he luxuriates in not fearing the uncertainty of the future. But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> arising from luxurious living, how many and great they are, none can be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>: it is necessary, however, to mention them now. Twofold the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, in the body, and in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: twofold the storm: twofold the diseases; not only in this respect, but because they are both incurable, and bring with them great calamities. Not so, frugality: but here is twofold health, twofold the benefits. <q>Sleep of health,</q> we read, <q>is in moderate eating.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir031.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 31:20</font></u></a></span> For everywhere, that which keeps measure is pleasant, that which is beyond measure, ceases to please. For say now: on a little spark put a great pile of fagots, and you will no longer see the fire shining, but much disagreeable smoke. On a very strong and large man lay a burden which exceeds his strength, and you will see him with his burden lying prostrate on the ground. Embark too large a freight in your vessel, and you have ensured a grievous shipwreck. Just so it is here. For just as in overladen ships, great is the tumult of the sailors, the pilot, the man at the prow, and the passengers, while they cast into the sea the things above deck, and things below; so here too, with their vomitings upwards, and their purgings downwards, they mar their constitutions, and destroy themselves. And what is the most shameful of all, the mouth is made to do the office of the nether parts, and that becomes the more shameful member. But if to the mouth the disgrace be such, think what must it be in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>! For indeed there it is all mist, all storm, all darkness, great the uproar of the thoughts, at being so thronged and crushed, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> itself crying out at the abuse done to it: all (the parts and faculties) complaining of one another, beseeching, entreating, that the filth may be discharged somewhere. And after it is flung out, still the turmoil is not at an end; but then comes fever and diseases. <q>And how comes it,</q> say you, <q>that one may see these luxurious livers, in goodly plight, riding on horseback? What idle talk is this,</q> say you, <q>to tell us of diseases? It is I that am diseased, I that am racked, I that am disgusting, while I have nothing to eat.</q> Ah me! For one may well lament at such words. But the sufferers with the gout, the men that are carried on litters, the men that are swathed with bandages, from what class of people, I ask you, shall we see these? And indeed, were it not that they would deem it an insult, and think my words opprobrious, I would before now have addressed them even by name. <q>But there are some of them, who are in good health as well.</q> Because they give themselves not merely to luxurious living, but also to labors. Else show me a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, who does nothing whatever but fatten himself, free from pain as he lies there, without an anxious thought. For though a host of physicians without number came together, they would not be able to rescue him from his diseases. It is not in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of things. For I will hold you a medical discourse. Of the matters sent down into the belly, not all becomes nourishment; since even in the food itself, not all is nutritive, but part of it in the process of digestion passes into stool, part is turned into nourishment. If then in the process of digestion the operation is perfect, this is the result, and each finds its proper place; the wholesome and useful part betakes itself to its appropriate place, while that which is superfluous and useless, withdraws itself, and passes off. But if it be in too great quantity, then even the nutritive part of it becomes hurtful. And, to speak by way of example, in order that my meaning may be clearer to you: in wheat part is fine flour, part meal, part bran: now if the mill be able to grind (what is put in), it separates all these: but if you put in too much, all becomes mixed up together. Wine again, if it go through its proper process of formation, and under due influence of the seasons, then, whereas at first all is mixed together, anon part settles into lees, part rises into scum, part remains for enjoyment to those that use it, and this is the good part, and will not readily undergo any change. But what they call <q>nourishment,</q> is neither wine, nor lees, while all are mixed up together.— The same may be seen in the river, when its waters make a whirling flood. As at such time we see the fishes floating at top, dead, their eyes first blinded by the muddy slime: so is it with us. For when gormandizing, like a flood of rain, has drenched the inward parts, it puts all in a whirl, and makes that the faculties (<span>λογισμοὶ</span>), healthy till then and living in a pure element, drift lifeless on the surface. Since then by all these examples we have shown how great the mischief is, let us cease to count these men <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> for that, for which we ought to think them wretched, and to bemoan ourselves for that, for which we ought to count ourselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>, and let us welcome sufficiency with a contented mind. Or do you not hear even what physicians tell you, that <q>want is the mother of health?</q> But what I say is, that want is mother, not of bodily health, but also of that of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. These things <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also, that physician indeed, cries aloud; when he says, <q>Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:8</font></u></a></span> Let us therefore do as he bids us, that so, being in sound health, we may perform the work that we ought to do, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus our Lord</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, dominion, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

No wonder that He who wrought those works, should also have wrought these. <q>You slew them who preached of Him,</q> much more Himself.

<p>Such is the boldness of speech of a man bearing the Cross. Let us then also imitate this: though it be not a time of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, yet it is always the time for boldness of speech. For, <q>I spoke,</q> says one, <q>in Your testimonies before kings, and was not ashamed.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa118.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 119:46</font></u></a></span> If we chance to be among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathens</font></u></a>, let us thus stop their mouths. without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, without harshness. (Comp. Hom. in 1 Cor. iv. §6; xxxiii. §4, 5; Col. xi. §2.) For if we do it with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, it no longer seems to be the boldness (of one who is confident of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>,) but passion: but if with gentleness, this is boldness indeed. For in one and the same thing success and failure cannot possibly go together. The boldness is a success: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> is a failure. Therefore, if we are to have boldness, we must be clean from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> that none may impute our words to that. No matter how just your words may be, when you speak with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, you ruin all: no matter how boldly you speak, how fairly reprove, or what not. See this man, how free from passion as he discourses to them! For he did not abuse them: he did but remind them of the words of the Prophets. For, to show you that it was not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, at the very moment he was suffering <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> at their hands, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a>, saying, <q>Lay not to their charge this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>.</q> So far was he from speaking these words in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>; no, he spoke in grief and sorrow for their sakes. As indeed this is why it speaks of his appearance, that <q>they saw his face as it had been the face of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a>,</q> on purpose that they might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. Let us then be clean from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> dwells not where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> is: cursed is the wrathful. It cannot be that anything wholesome should approach, where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> goes forth. For as in a storm at sea, great is the tumult, loud the clamor, and then would be no time for lessons of wisdom (<span>φιλοσοφεἵν</span>): so neither in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. If the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is to be in a condition either to say, or to be disciplined to, anything of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, it must first be in the haven. Do you see not how, when we wish to converse on matters of serious import, we look out for places free from noise, where all is stillness, all calm, that we may not be put out and discomposed? But if noise from without discomposes, much more disturbance from within. Whether one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, to no purpose does he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> <q>with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> and disputings:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti002.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 2:8</font></u></a></span> whether he speak, he will only make himself ridiculous: whether he hold his peace, so again it will be even then: whether he eat, he is hurt even then: whether he drink, or whether he drink not; whether he sit, or stand, or walk; whether he sleep: for even in their dreams such fancies haunt them. For what is there in such men that is not disagreeable? Eyes unsightly, mouth distorted, limbs agitated and swollen, tongue foul and sparing no man, mind distraught, gestures uncomely: much to disgust. Mark the eyes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04711a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demoniacs</font></u></a>, and those of drunkards and madmen; in what do they differ from each other? Is not the whole <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>? For what though it be but for the moment? The madman too is possessed for the moment: but what is worse than this? And they are not ashamed at that excuse; <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not (says one) what I said.</q> And how came it that thou did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> this, thou the rational man, you that hast the gift of reason, on purpose that you may not act the part of the creatures without reason, just like a wild horse, hurried away by rage and passion? In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, the very excuse is criminal. For you ought to have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> what you said. <q>It was the passion,</q> say you, <q>that spoke the words, not I.</q> How should it be that? For passion has no power, except it get it from you. You might as well say, <q>It was my hand that inflicted the wounds, not I.</q> What occasion, think you, most needs <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>? Would you not say, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and battle? But even then, if anything is done with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, the whole is spoiled and undone. For of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, those who fight had best not be enraged: of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, those had best not be enraged, who want to hurt (<span>τοὺς ὑβρίζοντας</span>). And how is it possible to fight then? You will ask. With reason, with self-command (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιεικεί&amp; 139law, and order, and times? For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> is nothing but an irrational impulse: and an irrational creature cannot possibly perform anything rational. For instance, the man here spoke such words, and did it without passion. And Elias said, How long will you halt on both your knees? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki018.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 18:21</font></u></a></span> and spoke it not in passion. And Phinees slew, and did it without passion. For passion suffers not a man to see, but, just as in a night-battle, it leads him, with eyes blindfolded and ears stopped up, where it will. Then let us rid ourselves of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demon</font></u></a>, at its first beginning let us quell it, let us put the sign of the Cross on our breast, as it were a curb. Wrath is a shameless dog: but let it learn to hear the law. If there be in a sheep-fold a dog so savage as not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> the command of the shepherd, nor to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> his voice, all is lost and ruined. He is kept along with the sheep: but if he makes a meal on the sheep, he is useless, and is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">put to death</font></u></a>. If he has learned to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> you, feed your dog: he is useful when it is against the wolves, against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, and against the captain of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> that he barks, not against the sheep, not against friends. If he does not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> he ruins all: if he learns not to mind you, he destroys all. The mildness in you let not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> consume, but let it guard it, and feed it up. And it will guard it, that it may feed in much security, if it destroy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thoughts, if it chase away the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> from every side. So is gentleness preserved, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> works are nowhere admitted: so we become worthy of respect, when we learn not to be shameless. For nothing renders a man so shameless, as an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>. Why are harlots without shame? Why are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a> shamefaced? Is it not from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> that the former, from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03637d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">chastity</font></u></a> that the latter, are such? For nothing makes a person so shameless, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. <q>And yet on the contrary,</q> say you, <q>it puts to shame.</q> Yes; him who condemns himself: but him that is past blushing, it renders even more reckless: for desperation makes daring. For <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>,</q> says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>, <q>when he has come into the depths of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, despises.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro018.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 18:3</font></u></a></span> But he that is shameless, will also be reckless, and he that is reckless, will be daring.</span></p>
<p>See in what way gentleness is destroyed, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thoughts gnaw at it. This is why there is such a dog, barking mightily: we have also sling and stone (ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what I mean): we have also spear and enclosure and cattle-fold: let us guard our thoughts unhurt. If the dog be gentle (<span>σαίνῃ</span>) with the sheep, but savage against those without, and keep vigilant watch, this is the excellence of a dog: and, be he ever so famished, not to devour the sheep; be he ever so full, not to spare the wolves. Such too is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> meant to be: however provoked, not to forsake gentleness; however at quiet, to be on the alert against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thoughts: to acknowledge the friend, and not for any beating forsake him, and for all his caressing, to fly at the intruder. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> uses caressing full oft: let the dog <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> at sight that he is an intruder. So also let us caress (<span>σαίνωμεν</span>) Virtue, though she put us to pain, and show our aversion to Vice, though she give us pleasure. Let us not be worse than the dogs, which, even when whipped and throttled, do not desert their master: but if the stranger also feed them, even so they do hurt. There are times when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> is useful; but this is when it barks against strangers. What means it, <q>Whosoever is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> with his brother without a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:22</font></u></a></span> It means, Stand not up in your own quarrel, neither avenge yourself: if you see another suffering deadly wrong, stretch out your hand to help him. This is no longer passion, when you are clear of all feeling for yourself alone. David had gotten Saul into his power, and was not moved by passion, did not thrust the spear into him, the enemy he had in his power; but took his revenge upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Devil</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa026.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 26:7</font></u></a></span> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, when he saw a stranger doing an injury, even slew him <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 2:22</font></u></a></span>: but when one of his own people, he did not so: them that were brethren he would have reconciled; the others not so. That <q>most meek</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/num012.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Numbers 12:3</font></u></a></span> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, as Scripture witnesses of him, see how he was roused! But not so, we: on the contrary, where we ought to show meekness, no wild beast so fierce as we: but where we ought to be roused, none so dull and sluggish. (Hom. vi. <em>de laud. Pauli, ad fin.</em>) On no occasion do we use our faculties to the purpose they were meant for: and therefore it is that our life is spent to no purpose. For even in the case of implements; if one use them, one instead of other, all is spoilt: if one take his sword, and then, where he should use it and cut with it, uses only his hand, he does no good: again, where he should use his hand, by taking the sword in hand he spoils all. In like manner also the physician, if where he ought to cut, he cuts not, and where he ought not, he does cut, mars all. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us use the thing (<span>τᾥ πράγματι</span>) at its proper time. The proper time for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> is never, where we move in our own quarrel: but if it is our duty to correct others, then is the time to use it, that we may by force deliver others. (<em>Hom. in Matt</em>. xvi. §7.) So shall we both be like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, always keeping a spirit free from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, and shall attain unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things that are to come, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with whom, to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, dominion, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and evermore, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

Just as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> are perplexed, saying, <q>What are we to do with these men?</q> so these also are <q>cut to the heart.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:16</font></u></a></span> And yet it was he that had good right to be incensed, who, having done no wrong, was treated like a criminal, and was spitefully <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumniated</font></u></a>. But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumniators</font></u></a> had the worst of it in the end. So <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> is that saying, which I am ever repeating, <q>Ill to do, is ill to fare.</q> And yet he (in his charges against them) resorted to no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumny</font></u></a>, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> (what he said). So sure are we, when we are shamefully borne down in a matter wherein we have a clear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, to be none the worse for it.— <q>If they desired,</q> say you, <q>to kill him, how was it that they did not take occasion, out of what he said, that they might kill him?</q> They would fain have a fair-seeming plea to put upon their outrage. <q>Well then, was not the insulting them a fair plea?</q> It was not his doing, if they were insulted: it was the Prophet's accusation of them. And besides, they did not wish it to look as if they killed him because of what he had said against them— just as they acted in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>; no, but for impiety: now this word of his was the expression of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. Wherefore, as they attempted, besides killing him, to hurt his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a> also, <q>they were cut to the heart.</q> For they were afraid lest he should on the contrary become an object of even greater reverence. Therefore, just what they did in Christ's case, the same they do here also. For as He said, <q>You shall see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> sitting on the right hand of God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat026.htm#verse64" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 26:64</font></u></a></span>, and they, calling it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a>, <q>ran upon Him;</q> just so was it here. There, they <q>rent their garments;</q> here, they <q>stopped their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ears</font></u></a>. But he, being full of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and Jesus standing on the right hand of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and said, Behold I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14144a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of Man</font></u></a> standing on the right hand of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accord</font></u></a>, and cast him out of the city, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him.</q></div>

This is the reason also why his face was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, being merciful, desired to make their machinations the means of recalling them unto Himself. And see, how many signs are wrought! <q>And cast him out of the city, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> him.</q> Here again, <q>without the city,</q> and even in death, Confession and Preaching. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb013.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 13:21</font></u></a></span> <q>And the witnesses laid down their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">clothes</font></u></a> at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. And they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a> Stephen, calling upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</q></div>

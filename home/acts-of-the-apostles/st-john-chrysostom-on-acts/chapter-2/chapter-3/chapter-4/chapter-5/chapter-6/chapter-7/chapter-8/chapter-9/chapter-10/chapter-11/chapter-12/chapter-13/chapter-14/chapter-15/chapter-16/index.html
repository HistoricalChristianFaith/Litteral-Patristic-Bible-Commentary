<p><q>And, behold a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, which was a Jewess, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>; but his father was a Greek: which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. Him would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> have to go forth with him; and took and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a> him because of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> which were in those quarters; for they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> all that his father was a Greek.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:1-3</font></u></a></span> It is indeed amazing, the wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>! He that has had so many battles about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, he that moved all things to this end, and did not give over until he had carried his point, now that the decree is made sure, circumcises the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>. He not only does not forbid others, but himself does this thing. (<em>b</em>) <q>Him,</q> it says, <q>he would have to go forth with him.</q> And the wonder is this, that he even took him unto him. <q>Because of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>which were in those parts:</q> for they would not endure to hear the word from one uncircumcised. (<em>a</em>) Nothing could be wiser. So that in all things he looked to what was profitable: he did nothing upon his own preference (<span>προλήψει</span>). (<em>c</em>) And what (then)? Mark the success: he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a>, that he might take away <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>: for he preached the decrees of the Apostles. <q>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the Apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. And so were the Churches established in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and increased in number daily.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 4, 5.)</strong> Do you mark fighting, and by fighting, edification? Not warred upon by others, but themselves doing contrary things, so they edified the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>! They introduced a decree not to circumcise, and he circumcises! <q>And so were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Churches</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>established in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>,</q> and in multitude: <q>increased,</q> it says, <q>in number daily.</q> Then he does not continue to tarry with these, as having come to visit them: but how? He goes further. <q>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> to preach the word in Asia,</q> </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:6</font></u></a></span> having left Phrygia and Galatia, they hastened into the interior. For, it says, <q>After they had come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:7</font></u></a></span> Wherefore they were forbidden, he does not say, but that they were <q>forbidden,</q> he does say, teaching us to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> and not ask questions, and showing that they did many things as men. <q>And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>suffered them not: but having passed by Mysia they came down to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15063c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Troas</font></u></a>.</q></p>

<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:9</font></u></a></span> Why a vision, and not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>? Because He forbade the other. He would even in this way draw them over: since to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> also He appeared in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05154a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">dream</font></u></a>, and in the beginning (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>) himself saw a vision, <q>a man coming in and laying his hands upon him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:12</font></u></a></span> In this manner also Christ appears to him, saying, <q>You must stand before Cæsar.</q> Then for this reason also He draws him there, that the preaching may be extended. This is why he was forbidden to tarry long in the other cities, Christ urging him on. For these were to enjoy the benefit of John for a long time, and perhaps did not extremely need him (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>), but there he behooved to go. And now he crosses over and goes forth. <q>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> unto them.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:10</font></u></a></span> Then the writer mentions also the places, as relating a history, and showing where he made a stay (namely), in the greater cities, but passed by the rest. <q>Therefore loosing from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15063c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Troas</font></u></a>, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 11, 12.)</strong> It is a high distinction for a city, the being a colony. <q>And in this city we were tarrying certain days.</q> But let us look over again what has been said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> <q>He went,</q> it says, <q>through</q> the cities <q>And, behold, there was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a>, by name Timothy, who had a good report of the brethren which were in Lystra and Iconium.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(v. 41; 16:1.)</strong> Great was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of Timothy. When Barnabas departed (<span>ἀ</span> <span>πέστη</span>), he finds another, equivalent to him. Of him he says, <q>Remembering your tears and your unfeigned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti001.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 1:5</font></u></a></span> His father continued to be a Gentile, and therefore it was that (Timothy) was not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcised</font></u></a>. (<em>a</em>) Observe the Law already broken. Or if not so, I suppose he was born after the preaching of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> but this is perhaps not so. (<em>c</em>) He was about to make him a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02581b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bishop</font></u></a>, and it was not meet that he should be uncircumcised. <em>(e)</em> And this was not a small matter, seeing it offended after so long a time: (<em>b</em>) <q>for from a child,</q> he says, <q>you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Scriptures</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ti003.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Timothy 3:15</font></u></a></span> (<em>d</em>) <q>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act016.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 16:4</font></u></a></span> For until then, there was no need for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> to keep any such. The beginning of the abrogation was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles'</font></u></a> not keeping these things, and being none the worse for it: nor having any inferiority in respect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>: anon, of their own will they abandoned the Law.

It is a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>: from the things we ought to get good from, we get <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. Thus also medicines of healing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, often, from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> of those who use them, ruin and destroy: and arms which are meant to protect, are themselves the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of death unless one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to put them on. But the reason is, that we seek everything rather than what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for ourselves. And in the case of a house, we seek what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for it, and we would not endure to see it decaying with age, or tottering, or hurt by storms: but for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> we make no account: nay, even should we see its foundations rotting, or the fabric and the roof, we make no account of it. Again, if we possess brute creatures, we seek what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for them: we call in both horse-feeders and horse-doctors, and all besides: we attend to their housing, and charge those who are entrusted with them, that they may not drive them at random or carelessly, nor take them out by night at unseasonable hours nor sell away their provender; and there are many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> laid down by us for the good of the brute creatures: but for that of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> there is no account taken. But why speak I of brute creatures which are useful to us? There are many who keep small birds (or <q>sparrows</q>) which are useful for nothing except that they simply amuse, and there are many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> even about them, and nothing is neglected or without order, and we take care for everything rather than for our own selves. Thus we make our selves more worthless than all. And if indeed a person abusively call us <q>dog,</q> we are annoyed: but while we are opprobrious to ourselves, not in word, but in deed, and do not even bestow as much care on our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as on dogs, we think it no great harm. Do you see how all is full of darkness? How many are careful about their dogs, that they may not be filled with more than the proper food, that so they may be keen and fit for hunting, being set on by famine and hunger: but for themselves they have no care to avoid luxury: and the brute creatures indeed they teach to exercise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, while they let themselves sink down into the savageness of the brutes. The thing is a riddle. <q>And where are your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> brutes?</q> There are such; or, say, do you not take it to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, when a dog gnawed with hunger, after having hunted and caught his prey, abstains from the food; and though he sees his meal ready before him, and with hunger urging him on, yet waits for his master? Be ashamed of yourselves: teach your bellies to be as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a>. You have no excuse. When you have been able to implant such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> self-command in an irrational nature, which neither speaks nor hears reason, shall you not much more be able to implant it in yourself? For that it is the effect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> care, not of nature is plain: since otherwise all dogs ought to have this habit. Do you then become as dogs. For it is you that compel me to fetch my examples thence: for indeed they should be drawn from heavenly things; but since if I speak of those, you say, <q>Those are (too) great,</q> therefore I speak nothing of heavenly things: again, if I speak of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, you say, <q>He was an Apostle:</q> therefore neither do I mention <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: if again I speak of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, you say, <q>That person could do it:</q> therefore I do not mention a man even, but a brute creature; a creature too, that has not this habit by nature, lest you should say that it effected this by nature, and not (which is the fact) from choice: and what is wonderful, choice not self-acquired, but (the result of) your care. The creature does not give a thought to the fatigue, the wear and tear it has undergone in running down the prey, not a thought to this, that by its own proper toil it has made the capture: but casting away all these regards, it observes the command of its master, and shows itself superior to the cravings of appetite. <q>True; because it looks to be praised, it looks to get a greater meal.</q> Say then to yourself, that the dog through hope of future pleasure, despises that which is present: while you do not choose for hope of future <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to despise those which are present; but he indeed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>, that, if he tastes of that food at the wrong time and against his master's will, he will both be deprived of that, and not get even that which was apportioned to him, but receive blows instead of food: whereas you cannot even perceive this, and that which he has learned by dint of custom, you do not succeed in acquiring even from reason. Let us imitate the dogs. The same thing hawks also and eagles are said to do: what the dogs do with regard to hares and deer, the same do those with regard to birds; and these too act from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> learned from men. These facts are enough to condemn us, these enough to convict us. To mention another thing:— they that are skilled in breaking horses, shall take them, wild, fierce, kicking, biting, and in a short time so discipline them, that though the teacher be not there, it is a luxury to ride them, their paces are so thoroughly well-ordered: but the paces of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> may be all disordered, and none cares for it: it bounds, and kicks, and its rider is dragged along the ground like a child, and makes a most disgraceful figure, and yet no one puts curbs on her, and leg-ties, and bits, nor mounts upon her the skilful rider— Christ, I mean. And therefore it is that all is turned upside down. For when you both teach dogs to master the craving of the belly, and tame the fury in a lion, and the unruliness of horses, and teach the birds to speak plainly, how inconsistent must it not be— to implant achievements of reason in natures that are without reason, and to import the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> of creatures without reason into natures endowed with reason? There is no excuse for us, none. All who have succeeded (in mastering their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>) will accuse us, both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> and unbelievers: for even unbelievers have so succeeded; yea, and wild beasts, and dogs, not men only: and we shall accuse our own selves, since we succeed, when we will, but when we are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a>, we are dragged away. For indeed many even of those who live a very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> life, have oftentimes changed themselves when they wished. But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> is, as I said, that we go about seeking for what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for other things, not what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for ourselves. If you build a splendid house, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for the house, not what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for yourself: if you take a beautiful garment, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> for the body, not for yourself: and if you get a good horse, it is so likewise. None makes it his mark how his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> shall be beautiful; and yet, when that is beautiful, there is no need of any of those things: as, if that be not beautiful, there is no good of them. For like as in the case of a bride, though there be chambers hung with tapestry wrought with gold, though there be choirs of the fairest and most beautiful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, though there be roses and garlands, though there be a comely bridegroom, and the maidservants and female friends, and everybody about them be handsome, yet, if the bride herself be full of deformity, there is no good of all those; as on the other hand if she were beautiful, neither would there be any loss arising from (the want of) those, nay just the contrary; for in the case of an ugly bride, those would make her look all the uglier, while in the other case, the beautiful would look all the more beautiful: just so, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, when she is beautiful, not only needs none of those adjuncts, but they even cast a shade over her beauty. For we shall see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a> shine, not so much when in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, as in poverty. For in the former case many will impute it to his riches, that he is not superior to riches: but when he lives with poverty for his mate, and shines through all, and will not let himself be compelled to do anything base, then none claims shares with him in the crown of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>. Let us then make our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> beauteous, if at least we would fain be rich. What profit is it, when your mules indeed are white and plump and in good condition, but you who are drawn by them are lean and scurvy and ill-favored? What is the gain, when your carpets indeed are soft and beautiful, full of rich embroidery and art, and your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> goes clad in rags, or even naked and foul? What the gain, when the horse indeed has his paces beautifully ordered, more like dancing than stepping, while the rider, together with his choral train and adorned with more than bridal ornaments, is more crooked than the lame, and has no more command over hands and feet than drunkards and madmen? Tell me now, if some one were to give you a beautiful horse, and to distort your body, what would be the profit? Now you have your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> distorted, and care you not for it? Let us at length, I beseech you, have a care for our own selves. Do not let us make our own selves more worthless than all beside. If anyone insult us with words, we are annoyed and vexed: but insulting ourselves as we do by our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, we do not give a thought to it. Let us, though late, come at last to our senses, that we may be enabled by having much care for our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and laying hold upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, to obtain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and evermore, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p>What tears do not these things call for! (Think) what they suffer, while we (live) in luxury, we in theatres, we perishing and drowning (in dissolute living), seeking always idle amusement, not enduring to suffer pain for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, not even as far as words, not even as far as talk. These things I beseech you let us ever call to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, what things they suffered, what things they endured, how undismayed they were, how unoffended. They were doing God's work, and suffered these things! They did not say, Why do we preach this, and God does not take our part? But even this was a benefit to them, even apart from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, in the thing itself; it made them more vigorous, stronger, intrepid. <q>Tribulation works endurance.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:4</font></u></a></span> Then let us not seek loose and dissolute living. For as in the one case the good is twofold, that the sufferers are made strong, and that the rewards are great; so in the other the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is twofold, that such are rendered more enervated, and that it is to no good, but only <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. For nothing can be more worthless than a man who passes all his time in idleness and luxury. For the man untried, as the saying is, is also unapproved; unapproved not only in the contests, but also in everything else. Idleness is a useless thing, and in luxury itself nothing is so unsuited to the end proposed as the leading a luxurious life: for it palls with satiety, so that neither the enjoyment of the viands is so great, nor the enjoyment of relaxation, but all becomes vapid, and runs to waste.</p>
<p>Then let us not seek after this. For if we will consider which has the pleasanter life, he that is toiled and hardworked, or he that lives in luxury, we shall find it to be the former. For in the first place, the bodily senses are neither clear nor sound, but dull (<span>χαὕναι</span>) and languid; and when those are not right, even of health there is plainly no enjoyment. Which is the useful horse, the pampered or the exercised? Which the serviceable ship, that which sails, or that which lies idle? Which the best water, the running or the stagnant? Which the best iron, that which is much used, or that which does no work? Does not the one shine bright as silver, while the other becomes all over rusty, useless, and even losing some of its own substance? The like happens also to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as the consequence of idleness: a kind of rust spreads over it, and corrodes both its brightness and everything else. How then shall one rub off this rust? With the whetstone of tribulations: so shall one make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> useful and fit for all things. Else, how, I ask, will she be able to cut off the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, with her edge turned (<span>ἀ</span> <span>νακλώσης</span>) and bending like lead? How shall she wound the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>?— And then to whom can such an one be other than a disgusting spectacle— a man cultivating obesity, dragging himself along like a seal? I speak not this of those who are naturally of this habit, but of those who by luxurious living have brought their bodies into such a condition, of those who are naturally of a spare habit. The sun has risen, has shot forth his bright beams on all sides, and roused up each person to his work: the husbandman goes forth with his spade, the smith with his hammer, and each artisan with his several instruments, and you will find each handling his proper tools; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> also takes either her distaff or her webs: while he, like the swine, immediately at the first dawn goes forth to feed his belly, seeking how he may provide sumptuous fare. And yet it is only for brute beasts to be feeding from morning to night; and for them, because their only use is to be slaughtered. Nay, even of the beasts, those which carry burdens and admit of being worked, go forth to their work while it is yet night. But this man, rising from his bed, when the (noon-tide) sun has filled the market-place, and people are tired of their several works, then this man gets up, stretching himself out just as if he were indeed a hog in fattening, having wasted the fairest part of the day in darkness. Then he sits there for a long time on his bed, often unable even to lift himself up from the last evening's debauch, and having wasted (still) more time in this (listlessness), proceeds to adorn himself, and issues forth, a spectacle of unseemliness, with nothing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> about him, but with all the appearance of a beast with a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> shape: his eyes rheumy from the effect of wine, * * * while the miserable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, just like the lame, is unable to rise, bearing about its bulk of flesh, like an elephant. Then he comes and sits in (various) places, and says and does such things, that it were better for him to be still sleeping than to be awake. If it chance that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> tidings be announced, he shows himself weaker than any girl; if good, more silly than any child; on his face there is a perpetual yawn. He is a mark for all that would do harm, if not for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, at least for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> easily excites such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, and all other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. All flatter him, all pay court to him, rendering his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> weaker than it is already: and each day he goes on and on, adding to his disease. If he chance to fall into any difficulty of business, he becomes dust and ashes, and his silken garments are of no help to him. We have not said all this without a purpose, but to teach you, that none of you should live idly and at random. For idleness and luxury are not conducive to work, to good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a>, to enjoyment. For who will not condemn such a man? Family, friends, kinsfolk (will say), He is indeed a very encumbrance of the ground. Such a man as this has come into the world to no purpose: or rather, not to no purpose, but to ill purpose against his own person, to his own ruin, and to the hurt of others. But that this is more pleasant— let us look to this; for this is the question. Well then, what can be less pleasant than (the condition of) a man who has nothing to do; what more wretched and miserable? Is it not worse than all the fetters in the world, to be always gaping and yawning, as one sits in the market-place, looking at the passers by? For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, as its nature is to be always on the move, cannot endure to be at rest. God has made it a creature of action: to work is of its very nature; to be idle is against its nature. For let us not judge of these things from those who are diseased, but let us put the thing itself to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of fact. Nothing is more hurtful than leisure, and having nothing to do: indeed therefore has God laid on us a necessity of working: for idleness hurts everything. Even to the members of the body, inaction is a mischief. Both eye, if it perform not its work, and mouth, and belly, and every member that one could mention, falls into the worst state of disease: but none so much as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. But as inaction is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, so is activity in things that ought to be let alone. For just as it is with the teeth, if one eats not, one receives hurt to them, and if one eats things unfitting, it jars them, and sets them on edge: so it is here; both if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> be inactive, and if inactive in wrong things, it loses its proper force. Then let us eschew both alike; both inaction, and the activity which is worse than inaction. And what may that be? Covetousness, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, envyings, and the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. As regards these, let us make it our object to be inactive, in order that we may obtain the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things promised to us, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><strong>(v. 34, 35.)</strong> It is likely the magistrates had learned what had happened, and did not dare of themselves to dismiss them. <q>And the keeper of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> told these words to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, saying, the magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. But <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said unto them, they have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>; and now do they thrust as out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. And they went out of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</q></p>

And they went to the house of Lydia, and having confirmed her, so departed. For it was not right to leave their hostess in distress and anxiety. But they went out, not in compliance with the request of those rulers, but hasting to the preaching: the city having been sufficiently benefited by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: for it was fit they should not be there any longer. For in the absence of them that wrought it, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> appeared greater, itself crying out more loudly: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> of the jailer was a voice in itself. What equal to this? He is put in bonds, and looses, being bound: looses a twofold bond: him that bound him, he looses by being bound.

<p>(<em>f</em>) Let us constantly bear in mind this jailer, not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>: how, prisoner as he was (the Apostle), persuaded his jailer. What say the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a>? <q>And of what things,</q> say they, <q>was such a man as this to be persuaded— a vile, wretched creature, of no understanding, full of all that is bad and nothing else, and easily brought over to anything? For these, say they, are the things, a tanner, a purple-seller, an eunuch, slaves, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.</q> This is what they say. What then will they be able to say, when we produce the men of rank and station, the centurion, the proconsul, those from that time to the present, the rulers themselves, the emperors? But for my part, I speak of something else, greater than this: let us look to these very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> of no consideration. <q>And where is the wonder?</q> say you. Why, this, I say, is a wonder. For, if a person be persuaded about any common things, it is no wonder: but if resurrection, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>, a life of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> self-command, be the subjects, and, discoursing of these to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> of mean consideration, one persuades them, it will be more wonderful than if one persuaded wise men. For when there is no danger attending the things of which one persuades people, then (the objector) might with some plausibility allege want of sense on their part: but when (the preacher) says— to the slave, as you will have it— <q>If you be persuaded by me, it is at your peril, you will have all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> for your enemies, you must die, you must suffer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> without number,</q> and yet for all this, convinces that man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, there can be no more talk here of want of sense. Since, if indeed the doctrines contained what was pleasant, one might fairly enough say this: but if, what the philosohers would never have chosen to learn, this the slave does learn, then is the wonder greater. And, if you will, let us bring before us the tanner himself, and see what were the subjects on which Peter conversed with him: or if you will, this same jailer. What then said <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> to him? <q>That Christ rose again,</q> say you; <q>that there is a resurrection of the dead, and a kingdom: and he had no difficulty in persuading him, a man easily led to anything.</q> How? Said he nothing about the mode of life; that he must be temperate, that he must be superior to money, that he must not be unmerciful, that he must impart of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to others? For it cannot be said, that the being persuaded to these things also was from the want of power of mind; no, to be brought to all this required a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. For be it so, that as far as the doctrines went, they were rendered more apt to receive these by their want of intelligence: but to accept such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, self-denying rule of life, how could that be owing to any defect of understanding? So that the less understanding the person may have, if nevertheless he is persuaded to things, to which even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a> were unable to persuade their fellow <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a>, the greater the wonder— when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> and slaves are persuaded of these truths, and prove it by their actions, of which same truths the Platos and all the rest of them were never able to persuade any man. And why say I, <q>any man?</q> Say rather, not themselves even: on the contrary, that money is not to be despised, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a> persuaded (his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>) by getting, as he did, such an abundance of property, and golden rings, and goblets; and that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to be had from the many is not to be despised, this Socrates himself shows, for all that he may philosophize without end on this point: for in everything he did, he had an eye to fame. And if you were conversant with his discourses, I might go at great length into this subject, and show what a deal of insincerity (<span>εἰρωνείαν</span>) there was in them—if at least we may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> what his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciple</font></u></a> says of him—and how that all his writings have their ground-work in vainglory. But, leaving them, let us direct the discourse to our own selves. For besides the things that have been said, there is this also to be added, that men were persuaded of these things to their own peril. Be not thou therefore shameless, but let us think over that night, the stocks, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hymns</font></u></a> of praise. This let us also do, and we shall open for ourselves— not a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, but— heaven.

I have both before discoursed to you on this, and now repeat it: let us arouse ourselves during the night: though thou make not many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, make one with watchfulness, and it is enough, I ask no more: and if not at midnight, at any rate at the first dawn. Show that the night is not only for the body, but also for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: do not suffer it to pass idly, but make this return to your Master: nay rather (the benefit) itself returns to you. Say, if we fall into any difficult strait, to whom do we not make request? And if we soon obtain our request, we breathe freely again. What a boon were it for you, to have a friend to go to with your request, who shall be ready to take it as a kindness, and to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> to you for your asking? What a boon, not to have to go about and seek one to ask of, but to find one ready? To have no need of others through whom you may solicit? What could be greater than this? Since here is One who then does most, when we make not our requests of others than Himself: just as a sincere friend then most complains of us for not trusting in his friendship, when we ask of others to make request to him. Thus also let us act. <q>But what,</q> you will ask, <q>if I should have offended Him?</q> Cease to give offense, and weep, and so draw near to Him, and you will quickly render Him propitious as to your former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Say only, I have offended: say it from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and with a sincere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, and all things are remitted to you. Thou dost not so much desire your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> to be forgiven, as He desires to forgive you your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that thou dost not so desire it, consider that you have no mind either to practice <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05647a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vigils</font></u></a>, or to give your money freely: but He, that He might forgive our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, spared not His Only-begotten and True Son, the partner of His throne. Do you see how He more desires to forgive you your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> (than thou to be forgiven)? Then let us not be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14057c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slothful</font></u></a>, nor put off this any longer. He is merciful and good: only let us give Him an opportunity.</p>
<p>And (even) this (He seeks), only that we may not become unprofitable, since even without this He could have freed us from them: but like as we (with the same view) devise and arrange many things for our servants to do, so does He in the matter of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. <q>Let us anticipate His face with thanksgiving.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa094.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 95:2</font></u></a>. <q>Let us come before His presence.</q> E.V.</span>, since He is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> and kind. But if you call not upon Him, what will <em>He</em> do? Thou dost not choose to say, Forgive; you will not say it from your heart, but with your mouth only. What is it, to call in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>? (To call) with purpose of heart, with earnestness, with a sincere mind; just as men say of perfumes, <q>This is genuine, and has nothing spurious,</q> so here. He who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> calls on Him, he who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a> to Him, continually attends to it, and desists not, until he obtain (his request): but he who does it in a merely formal manner (<span>ἀ</span> <span>φοσιούμενος</span>), and even this only by way of fulfilling a law, does not call in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>. Whosoever you are, say not only, <q>I am a sinner,</q> but be earnest also to rid yourself of this character; say not this only, but also grieve. If you grieve, you are in earnest: if you are not in earnest, you grieve not: if you grieve not, you trifle. What sort of man is he who shall say, <q>I am sick,</q> and not to do all to be freed from his sickness? A mighty weapon is Prayer. <q>If you,</q> says the Lord, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to give good gifts to your children, how much more your Father?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk011.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 11:13</font></u></a></span> Then wherefore are you unwilling to approach Him? He loves you, He is of more power than all besides. Both willing is He and able, what is there to hinder? Nothing. But then, on our part, let us draw near with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, draw near, offering the gifts that He desires, forgetfulness of wrongs, kindness, meekness. Though thou be a sinner, with boldness shall you ask of Him forgiveness of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, if you can show that this has been done by yourself: but though thou be righteous, and possess not this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of forgetfulness of injuries, you are none the better for it. It cannot be that a man who has forgiven his neighbor should not obtain perfect forgiveness: for God is beyond comparison more merciful than we. What do you say? If you say, <q>I have been wronged, I have subdued my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, I have endured the onset of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> because of Your command, and dost Thou not forgive?</q> Full surely He will forgive: and this is plain to all. Therefore let us purge our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> from all resentment. This is sufficient for us, in order that we may be heard; and let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> with watching and much perseverance, that having enjoyed His bountiful mercy, we may be found worthy of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things promised, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p>The writer is now about to relate the affair of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ananias</font></u></a> and Sapphira, and in order to show that the man's <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> was of the worst description, he first mentions him who performed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> deed; that, there being so great a multitude all doing the same, so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, he, taught by none of these, but blinded by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, brought destruction upon his own head. <q>Having land—meaning that this was all he possessed—sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles' feet.

How came it into the mind of this hapless wretch to commit this crime? <q>But Peter said, Ananias, why has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> filled your heart to lie to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</q></p>

And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>? Behold, the feet of them which have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out.

And great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> came upon all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, and upon as many as heard these things.</q></p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:9-11</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>After this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> had come upon them, he wrought more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>; both Peter and the rest; <q>And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accord</font></u></a> in Solomon's porch. And of the rest dared no man join himself to them,</q> i.e. to the Apostles; <q>but the people magnified them,</q> i.e. the Jewish people. If <q>no man dared join himself unto them,</q> the Apostles, <q>there were,</q> however, <q>the more added unto the Lord, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>, multitudes both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, insomuch that they brought out into the streets their impotent folk, and laid them upon couches and beds, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:12-15</font></u></a></span> For Peter was the wonderful one, and he to whom they more gave heed both because of his public harangue, the first and the second and the third, and because of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>; for he it was that wrought the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, the first, the second, the third: for the present <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> was twofold: first, the convicting the thoughts of the heart, and next the inflicting of death at his word of command. <q>That at the least the shadow of Peter passing by,</q> etc. This had not occurred in the history of Christ; but see here what He had told them actually coming to pass, that <q>they which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Me, the works that I do shall they do also; and greater works than these shall they do.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 14:12</font></u></a></span> <q>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed every one.</q> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:16</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>And now I would have you observe the way in which their whole life is interwoven. First there was despondency on account of Christ taken from them, and then came <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> because of the Spirit descending upon them; again, dejection because of the scoffers, and then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> in the result of their own apology. And here again we find both dejection and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>. In that they had become conspicuous, and that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> made revelations to them, there was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>: in that they had cut off some of their own company, there was sadness. Once more: again there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a> upon their success, and again sadness by reason of the High Priest. And so it will be seen to be the case throughout. And the same will be found to hold in the case of the ancient <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> likewise.— But let us look over again what has been said.</p>
<p><q>They sold them,</q> it is written, <q>and brought the prices, and laid them down at the Apostles' feet.</q> </p>
<p><span><strong><font size="4">Recapitulation.</font></strong> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:34-37</font></u></a></span> See, my beloved brethren, how instead of leaving the Apostles to sell, they themselves sold, and presented the prices to them. <q>But a certain man named Ananias,</q> etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:1</font></u></a></span> This history touches Bishops too, and very forcibly. And the wife of Ananias was privy to the thing done: therefore he examines her. But perhaps some one will say that he dealt very harshly with her. What do you mean? What harshness? If for gathering sticks a man is to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>, much rather ought he for sacrilege; for this money was become sacred. He that has chosen to sell his goods and distribute them, and then withdraws them, is guilty of sacrilege. But if he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrilegious</font></u></a>, who resumes from his own, much more he who takes from what is not his own. And do not think that because the consequence is not now the same, the crime will go unpunished. Do you see that this is the charge brought against Ananias, that having made the money sacred, he afterwards secreted it? Couldest thou not, said Peter, after selling your land, use the proceeds as your own? Were you forbidden? Wherefore after you had promised it? See how at the very beginning, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> made his attack; in the very midst of such signs and wonders, how this man was hardened! Something of the same kind had happened upon a time in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>. The son of Charmi <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">coveted</font></u></a> the devoted thing: for observe there also what vengeance ensues upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. Sacrilege, beloved, is a most grievous crime, insulting, and full of contempt. We neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> you to sell, the Apostle says, nor to give your money when you had sold; of your own free choice you did it; why have you then stolen from the sacred treasury? <q>Why,</q> he says, <q>has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> filled your heart?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:3</font></u></a></span> Well, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a> did the thing, why is the man made guilty of it? For admitting the influence of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, and being filled with it. You will say, they ought to have corrected him. But he would not have received correction; for he that has seen such things as he had seen, and is none the better, would certainly be none the better for anything else that could be done; the matter was not one to be simply passed over: like a gangrene, it must be cut out, that it might not infect the rest of the body. As it is, both the man himself is benefitted in regard that he is not left to advance further in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, and the rest, in that they are made more earnest; otherwise the contrary would have ensued. In the next place, Peter proves him guilty, and shows that the deed was not hidden from him, and then pronounces the sentence. But wherefore, upon what purpose have you done this? Did you wish to keep it? You ought to have kept it all along, and never to have professed to give it. The sacrilege, beloved, is a grievous one. For another, it may be, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">coveted</font></u></a> what was not his own: but it was at your discretion to keep what was your own. Why then did you first make it sacred, and then take it? Out of excessive contempt have you done this. The deed does not admit of pardon, it is past pleading for.— Therefore let it be no stumbling-block to any, if at present also there are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrilegious</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>. If there were such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> then, much more now, when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> are many. But let us <q>rebuke them before all, that others also may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:20</font></u></a></span> Judas was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrilegious</font></u></a>, but it was no stumbling-block to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. Do you see how many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> spring from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a>? <q>And great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, it is said, came on all them that heard these things.</q> </p>

And yet, signs had been wrought before: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, but there was not such a sense of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. So <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> is that saying, <q>The Lord is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> by executing judgments.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa009.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 9:16</font></u></a></span> The same thing had occurred in the case of the Ark: Uzzah was punished and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> came upon the rest. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2sa006.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Samuel 6:7</font></u></a></span> But in that instance the king through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> removed from him the Ark; but here the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> became more earnestly heedful.

Such the teacher's awfulness, such the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples'</font></u></a> reverence, such the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>! <q>An interval of three hours,</q>— and yet the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> did not hear of it, and none of those present reported it, although there was time enough for it to be noised abroad; but they were afraid. This circumstance the Evangelist relates with wonder even, when he says, <q>Not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> what was done, came in.</q> <q>And Peter answered unto her,</q> etc. </p>

For why, having questioned none other, does he question you? Was it not clear that he asked because he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>? But so great was her hardness, it would not let her attempt to evade the guilt; and with great confidence she replied; for she thought she was speaking only to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>. The aggravation of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> was, that they committed it as with one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, just as upon a settled compact between them. <q>How is it that you have agreed together,</q> he said, <q>to tempt the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of the Lord</font></u></a>?

No longer they guarded themselves against touching the unclean; nay, without scruple they handled the dead.

Great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, surpassing what had been shown in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. How comes this? Because Christ declared: <q>And greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto My Father.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 14:12</font></u></a></span> And these things the people do, while the Apostles remain there, and are not moving about from place to place: also from other places they were all bringing [their sick] on beds and couches: and from all quarters accrued to them fresh tribute of wonder; from them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, from them that were healed, from him that was punished; from their boldness of speech towards those (their adversaries), from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a> behavior of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a>: for certainly the effect produced was not owing to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> only. For though the Apostles themselves modestly ascribe it all to this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, declaring that they did these things in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, yet at the same time the life and noble conduct of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> helped to produce this effect. <q>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> were more added unto the Lord, multitudes both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>.</q> Observe, how he now no longer tells the number of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>; at such a rate was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> making way even to an immense multitude, and so widely was the Resurrection proclaimed. So then <q>the people magnified them:</q> but they were now no longer lightly to be despised as once they were: for in a little moment, at a single turn of the scale, such have been the effects produced by the fisherman and by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12553d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">publican</font></u></a>! Earth was become a heaven, for manner of life, for boldness of speech, for wonders, for all besides; like Angels were they looked upon with wonder: all unconcerued for ridicule, for threats, for perils: compassionate were they, and beneficent; some of them they succoured with money, and some with words, and some with healing of their bodies and of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>; no kind of healing (<span>πἅν εἶδος ἰατρείας</span>) but they accomplished.</p>
<p>Peter all but pleads for himself, when at the point to inflict the punishment, and at the same time gives a lesson to the rest. For because the act would seem exceeding stern, therefore it is that he does so much in the case. In respect of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> also the process of judgment was terrible. But see how many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> grow out of the sacrilege: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, contempt of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, impiety; and upon these too he pleaded for himself before the assembly, in that he did not immediately proceed to punishment, but first exposed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. None groaned, none lamented, all were terrified. For as their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> increased, the signs also were multiplied, and great was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> among their own company: for the things which are from without do not so militate (<span>πολεμεἵ</span>) against our peace, as do the acts of our own people. If we be firmly joined together, no warfare will be hard: but the mischief would be the being divided and broken up. Now they went about in the public place: with boldness they attacked even the market, and in the midst of enemies they prevailed, and that saying was fulfilled, <q>Be Thou Ruler in the midst among Your enemies.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa109.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 110:2</font></u></a></span> This was a greater <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, that they, arrested, cast into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, should do such acts as these!</p>
<p>If those for lying suffered such things, what shall not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjured</font></u></a> suffer? Because she simply affirmed, <q>Yea, for so much,</q> ye see what she suffered. Bethink you then; they that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> and forswear themselves, of what should they be worthy? It comes in opportunely today even from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a> to show you the heinousness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>. <q>There was,</q> it says, <q>a flying sickle, ten cubits in breadth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/zec005.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Zechariah 5:2</font></u></a></span> The <q>flying</q> betokens the swift advent of the vengeance which pursues oaths; that it is many cubits in length and breadth, signifies the force and magnitude of the woes; that it comes flying <q>from heaven,</q> is to show that the vengeance comes from the judgment-seat on high: that it is in the form of a sickle, denotes the inevitableness of the doom: for just as the sickle, where it comes and has hooked the neck, is not drawn back with nothing but itself, but with the head reaped off, even so the vengeance which comes upon the swearers is severe, and will not desist until it have completed its work. But if we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> and escape, let us not be confident; this is but to our woe. For what think ye? How many, since Ananias and Sapphira, have dared the same with them? How is it then, say you, that they have not met with the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a>? Not because it was allowed in them, but because they are reserved for a greater punishment. For those who often <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> and are not punished, have greater reason to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and dread than if they were punished. For the vengeance is increased for them by their present impunity and the long-suffering of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Then let us not look to this, that we are not punished; but let us consider whether we have not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>: if sinning we are not punished, we have the more reason to tremble. Say, if you have a slave, and you only threaten him, and do not beat him; when is he most in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, when most inclined to run away? Is is not when you only threaten him? And hence we advise each other not to be continually using threats, thereby choosing rather to agitate the mind by the terror, and lacerating it worse than with blows. For in the one instance the punishment is momentary, but in the other it is perpetual. If then no one feels the stroke of the sickle, do not look to this, but rather let each consider whether he commits such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. Many like things are done now as were done before the Flood, yet no flood has been sent: because there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> threatened, and vengeance. Many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> as the people did in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14130a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sodom</font></u></a>, yet no rain of fire has been poured down; because a river of fire is prepared. Many go the lengths of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>; yet they have not fared like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>, they have not been drowned in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12688a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Red Sea</font></u></a>: for the sea that awaits them, is the sea of the bottomless pit, where the punishment is not accompanied with insensibility, where there is no suffocation to end all, but in ever lengthened torture, in burning, in strangling, they are consumed there. Many have offended like the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a>, but no serpents have devoured them: there awaits them the worm that never dies. Many have been like Gehazi, yet they have not been struck with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprosy</font></u></a>: for instead of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leprosy</font></u></a>, it remains for them to be cut asunder, and numbered among the hypocrites. Many have both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a> and forsworn; but if they have indeed escaped, let us not be confident: the gnashing of teeth awaits them. Yea, here too they will suffer many grievous woes, though, it may be, not immediately, but after further transgressions, that the vengeance may be the greater; for even we often set out at first with small <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, and then through great offenses lose all. Therefore when you see anything happening to you, call to mind that particular <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> of yours. The sons of Jacob are an example of this. Remember Joseph's brothers; they had sold their brother, they had even attempted to slay him; nay, they had slain him, as far as inclination went; they had deceived and grieved the old man; they suffered nothing. After many years they are brought into extreme peril, and now they are put in remembrance of this their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. Exceeding wisely is this circumstance brought in. Hear what they say: <q>We are verily guilty concerning our brother.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen042.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 42:21</font></u></a></span> In this manner then do thou also, when anything happens, say, We are verily guilty, because we have not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> Christ; because we have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a>; my much swearing, and my false swearing, has fallen upon my own head. Confess thou; since they also confessed, and were saved. For what though the punishment follow not immediately? Since Ahab also did not immediately after his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> in the matter of Naboth suffer that vengeance which he yet at last suffered. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki021.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 21:19</font></u></a></span> And what is the reason of this? God sets you a time, in which to wash yourself clean; but if you persist, at last He will send down the vengeance. You have seen the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a> of liars. Consider what is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a> of false swearers, consider, and desist. It is impossible a swearer should not forswear himself, whether he will or not; and no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjurer</font></u></a> can be saved. One false <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> suffices to finish all, to draw down upon us the whole measure of vengeance. Let us then take heed to ourselves, that we may escape the punishment due to this offense, and be deemed worthy of the loving kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercies of His only-begotten Son, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>Then having risen up, the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> and they that were with him (which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13674a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sect</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13323a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sadducees</font></u></a>) were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them in the common <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><q>Having risen up,</q> that is, being roused, being excited at the things taking place, the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> and they which were with him (which is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13674a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sect</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13323a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sadducees</font></u></a>) were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the Apostles: they now assault them more vigorously: <q>and put them in the common <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>;</q> but did not immediately bring them to trial, because they expected them again to be softened down. <q>But the Angel of the Lord opened the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</q> <q>And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:19-21</font></u></a></span> This was done both for the encouragement of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, and for the benefit and instruction of the others. And observe how the proceeding in the present instance is just the same as in what Christ Himself did. Namely, in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> though He does not let <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210113.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> see them in the act of being wrought, He furnishes the means whereby they may be apprised of the things wrought: thus, in His Resurrection, He did not let them see how He rose: in the water made wine, the guests do not see it done, for they have been drinking much, and the discernment He leaves to others. Just so in the present case, they do not see them in the act of being brought forth, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> from which they might gather what had been done, they do see. And it was by night that the Angel put them forth. Why was this? Because in this way they were more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> than they would have been in the other: so, people would not even have had occasion to put the question: they would not in some other way have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. So it was in the old times, in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10666c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nebuchadnezzar</font></u></a>: he saw them praising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210113.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210113.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">furnace</font></u></a>, and then indeed he was put in amazement. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan003.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 3:24</font></u></a></span> Whereas then these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> ought as their first question to have asked, How did you come out? Instead of this, as if nothing had happened, they ask, <q>Did we not strictly charge you not to speak?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:28</font></u></a></span> And observe, by report of others they are apprised of all the circumstances: they see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> remaining closed with safety, and the guards standing before the doors. A twofold security this; as was the case at the sepulchre, where was both the seal, and the men to watch. See how they fought against God! Say, was this of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> doing, that happened to them? Who led them forth, when the doors were shut? How came they out, with the keepers standing before the door? Verily they must be mad or drunken to talk so. Here are men, whom neither <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, nor bonds, nor closed doors, had been able to keep in; and yet they expect to overpower them: such is their childish folly! Their officers come and confess what has taken place, as if on purpose to debar them from all show of reason. Do you mark how there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, differing in kind, some wrought by them, others on them, and these more illustrious than the others? <q>And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, and sent to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> to have them brought. But when the officers came, and found them not in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, they returned, and told, saying, The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. Now when the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210113.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">captain</font></u></a> of the temple and the chief <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> heard these things, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubted</font></u></a> of them whereunto this would grow.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:21-25</font></u></a></span> It is well ordered that the information was not brought to them at once, but they are first utterly at a loss what to think, that when they have considered it well and seen that there is a Divine Power in the case, then they may learn the whole state of the case. <q>Then came one, and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. Then went the captain with the other officers, and brought them without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>: for they feared the multitude, lest they should have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>.</q> (v. 25, 26.) O the folly of the men! <q>They feared,</q> says he, <q>the multitude.</q> Why, how had the multitude helped the Apostles? When they ought to have feared that God Who was continually delivering them like winged creatures out of their power, instead of that, <q>they feared the multitude!</q> <q>And the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>,</q> shameless, reckless, senseless, <q>asked them, saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? And, behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</q> (v. 27, 28.) What then (say the Apostles)? Again with mildness they address them; and yet they might have said, <q>Who are you, that you countermand God?</q> But what do they say? Again in the way of exhortation and advice, and with much mildness, they make answer. <q>Then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said, We ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> God rather than men.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:29</font></u></a></span> High magnanimity! He shows them too that they are fighting against God. For, he says, Whom you killed, Him has God raised up. <q>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, Whom you slew and hanged on a tree. Him has God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, and forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q> (v. 30, 31.) And again they refer the whole to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, that He should not seem to be alien to the Father. <q>And has exalted,</q> says He, <q>with his right hand.</q> He affirms not merely the Resurrection, but the Exaltation also. <q>For to give repentance to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> Observe here as before the gain (to them): observe the perfection of doctrine conveyed in the form of apology. <q>And we are witnesses of these things.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:32</font></u></a></span> Great boldness of speech! And the ground of their credibility: <q>And so is also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, Whom God has given to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> Him.</q> Do you observe that they allege not only the Spirit's testimony? And they said not, <q>Whom He has given</q> to us, but, <q>to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> Him:</q> therein alike showing their own unassuming temper, and intimating the greatness of the gift, and showing the hearers that it was possible for them also to receive the Spirit. See, how these people were instructed both by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and by words, and yet they paid no heed, that their condemnation might be just. For to this end did God suffer the Apostles to be brought to trial, that both their adversaries might be instructed, and all might learn, and that the Apostles might be invigorated to boldness of speech. <q>And they hearing that, were cut to the heart.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:33</font></u></a></span> The others (on a former occasion) <q>when they heard these things were pricked;</q> here they were cut (as with a saw) (<span>διεπρίοντο</span>) <q>and desired to slay them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:37</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>But it is necessary now to look over again what we have read. <q>But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> of the Lord by night opened the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a> doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. Brought them forth.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation, v. 19, 20.)</font></strong> He did not bring them away to benefit themselves thereby, but, <q>Stand,</q> he says, <q>and speak in the temple to the people.</q> But if the guards had put them out, as those thought, they would have fled, that is, supposing they had been induced to come out: and if those had put them forth, they would not have stood in the temple, but would have absconded. No one is so void of sense, as not at once to see this. <q>Did we not strictly charge you?</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:28</font></u></a></span> Well, if they undertook to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> you, you do well to call them to account: but if even at the very time they told you they would not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>, what account have you to call them to, what defence is there for them to make? <q>And behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</q> Mark the inconsistency of the accusations and the exceeding folly. They want to make it appear now, that the dispositions of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> are sanguinary, as if they were doing these things not for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth's</font></u></a> sake, but in the wish to be revenged. And for this reason too the Apostles do not answer them with defiance (<span>θρασέως</span>): for they were teachers. And yet where is the man, who, with a whole city to back him, and endowed with so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, would not have spoken and uttered something big? But not so did these: for they were not angered; no, they pitied these men, and wept over them, and marked in what way they might free them from their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. And they no longer say to them, <q>Judge ye:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:19</font></u></a></span> but they simply affirm, saying, <q>Whom God raised up, Him do we preach: it is by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of God that these things are done.</q> They said not, Did not we tell you even then, that <q>we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:20</font></u></a></span> for they are not contentious for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; but they repeat again the same story—the Cross, the Resurrection. And they tell not, wherefore He was crucified— that it was for our sakes: but they hint at this indeed, but not openly as yet, wishing to terrify them awhile. And yet what sort of rhetoric is here? None at all, but everywhere it is still the Passion, and the Resurrection and the Ascension, and the end wherefore: <q>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus,</q> etc. (v. 30, 31.) And yet what improbable assertions are these! Very improbable, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>; but for all that, not rulers, not people, had a word to say against them: but those had their mouths stopped, and these received the teaching. <q>And we,</q> says he, <q>are witnesses of these things.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:32</font></u></a></span> Of what things? Of His having promised forgiveness and repentance: for the Resurrection indeed was acknowledged, now. But that He gives forgiveness, both we are witnesses, and <q>so is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>,</q> Who would not have come down, unless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> had been first remitted: so that this is an indisputable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>. <q>When they heard that, they were cut</q> (to the heart), <q>and took counsel to slay them.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:33</font></u></a></span> Do you hear of the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, O wretched man, and that God does not demand punishment, and do you wish to slay them? What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> was this! And yet, either they ought to have convicted them of lying, or if they could not do that, to have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>: but if they did not choose to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>, yet they ought not to slay them. For what was there deserving of death? Such was their intoxication, they did not even see what had taken place. Observe, how everywhere the Apostles, when they have made mention of the crime, add the mention of forgiveness; showing, that while what had been done was worthy of death, that which was given was proffered to them as to benefactors! In what other way could any one have persuaded them?</p>
<p><q>Then stood up the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a>,</q> etc. As men in high repute, these (the Apostles) were about to take their place near to the Prophets. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13323a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sadducees</font></u></a> were they that were most sore on the subject of the Resurrection. But perchance some one will say: Why, what man, endowed with such gifts as the Apostles were, would not have been great? But consider, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, how, before that they were endowed with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, <q>they were continuing steadfastly with one accord in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act001.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 1:14</font></u></a></span>, and depending on the aid from above. And do you, my beloved, hope for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>, yet endurest naught? And have you received the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, yet sufferest not such things, nor encounterest perils? But they, before they had breathing-time from their former dangers, were again led into others. And even this too, that there is no arrogance, no conceit, how great a good it is! To converse with mildness, what a gain it is! For not all that they did was the immediate work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, but there are many marks of their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> as well. That the gifts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> shine forth in them, this was from their own diligence. See, for instance, from the very beginning, how careful Peter is; how sober and vigilant: how they that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> cast away their riches, had no private property, continued in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, showed that they were of one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, passed their time in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05789c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fastings</font></u></a>. What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, I ask (alone), did all this? Therefore it is that He brings the evidence home to them through their own officers. Just as in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, it was their officers who said, <q>Never man spoke as this Man speaks.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh007.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 7:46</font></u></a></span> These (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a>) are more apt to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> than the Resurrection.— Observe also the moderation shown by (the rulers) themselves, and how they give way. <q>The high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> asked them, saying,</q> etc.</p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:27</font></u></a></span>: here he reasons with them, forsooth, in a moderate tone; for he was frightened: indeed to hinder was what he desired rather than to kill, since that he cannot do: and with the view to rouse them all, and show them the extreme danger they are in, <q>And intend,</q> says he (to the Apostles), <q>to bring this man's blood upon us.</q> Do you still take Him to be but <em>man?</em> He wants to make it appear that the injunction was necessary for their own safety. But mark what (Peter) says: <q>Him has God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, and forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>.</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:33</font></u></a></span> See again these in perplexity, these in pain: but those in quiet and cheerfulness and delight. It is not merely, They were grieved, but <q>They were cut</q> (to the heart). Truly this makes good that proverb, <q>Evil do, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> fare:</q> as we may see in this case. Here were these men in bonds, set at the bar of judgment, and the men that sit in judgment upon them were in distress and helpless perplexity. For as he who strikes a blow upon the adamant, gets the shock of the blow himself, so it was with these men. But they saw that not only was their boldness of speech not stopped, but rather their preaching increased the more, and that they discoursed without a thought of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and afforded them no handles against them.</p>
<p>Let us imitate these, my beloved: let us be undaunted in all our dangers. There is nothing dreadful to him that fears <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; but all that is dreadful is for others. For when a man is delivered from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and regards all present things as a shadow, say, from whom shall he suffer anything dreadful? Whom shall he have to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? Whom shall he need plead to? Let us flee to this Rock which cannot be shaken. If any one were to build for us a city, and throw up a wall around it, and remove us to a land uninhabited, where there were none to disturb us, and there supply us with abundance of everything, and not suffer us to have anything to trouble us with anybody, he would not set us in such perfect safety, as Christ has done now. Be it a city made of brass, if you will, surrounded on all sides with a wall, lofty and impregnable, let there be no enemy near it; let it have land plentiful and rich, let there be added abundance of other things, let the citizens too be mild and gentle, and no evil-doer there, neither robber, nor thief, no informer, no court of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a>, but merely agreements (<span>συναλλάλματα</span>); and let us dwell in this city: not even thus would it be possible to live in security. Wherefore? Because there could not but be differences with servants, with wives, with children, to be a groundwork of much discomfort. But here was nothing of the kind; for here was nothing at all to pain them or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> any discomfort. Nay, what is more wonderful to say, the very things which are thought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> discomfort, became matter of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>. For tell me, what was there for them to be annoyed at? What to take amiss? Shall we cite a particular case for comparison with them? Well, let there be one of consular dignity, let him be possessed of much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, let him dwell in the imperial city, let him have no troublesome business with anybody, but only live in delight, and have nothing else but this to do, seated at the very summit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and power: and let us set against him a Peter, in bonds if you will, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> without number: and we shall find that he is the man that lives the most delightfully. For when there is such excess of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, as to be delighted when in bonds, think what must be the greatness of that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>! For like as those who are high in office, whatsoever <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> may happen, are not sensible of them, but continue in enjoyment: so did these the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> on account of these very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>. For it is impossible, impossible in words to express how great pleasure falls to their lot, who suffer for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> sake: for they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in their sufferings, rather than in their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things. Whoso loves Christ, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> what I say.— But what as regards safety? And who, I ask, if he were ever so rich, could have escaped so many perils, going about among so many different nations, for the sole purpose of bringing about a reformation in their manner of life? For it was just as if by royal mandate that they carried all before them, nay, far more easily, for never mandate could have been so effectual, as their words were. For the royal edict compels by necessity, but these drew men willingly and spontaneously, yea, and with hearts above measure thankful. What royal edict, I ask, would ever have persuaded men to part with all their property and their lives; to despise home, country, kindred, yea, even self-preservation? Yet the voices of fishermen and tent-makers availed for this. So that they were both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a>, and more powerful and strong than all others. <q>Yes,</q> say you, <q>those of course were, for they wrought <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>.</q> (<em>supra</em>, p. 83, note 4.) But I ask what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> did those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> work, the three thousand, and the five thousand; and yet these, we read, passed their time in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>? And well they might: for that which is the groundwork of all discomforts, the possession of riches, was done away with. For that, that, I say, was ever the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> and fighting, and grief, and discomfort, and all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>: the thing which makes life full of labor and troubles, it is that. And indeed it would be found that many more rich than poor have reason to be sad. If any think this is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, their notion is derived not from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the things, but from their own fancy. And if the rich do enjoy some sort of pleasure, this is not to be wondered at: for even those who are covered all over with the itch, have a good deal of pleasure. For that the rich are for all the world like these, and their mind affected in the same sort, is plain from this circumstance. Their cares annoy them, and they choose to be engrossed with them for the sake of the momentary pleasure: while those who are free from these affections, are in health and without discomfort. Whether is more pleasant, I ask, whether of the two more safe? To have to take thought only for a single loaf of bread and suit of clothes, or for an immense <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>, both slaves and freemen, not having care about himself (only)? For as this man has his fears for himself, so have you for those who depend on your own person. Why, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, does poverty seem a thing to be shunned? Just in the same way as other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things are, in the judgment of many, things to be deprecated. <q>Yes,</q> say you, <q>but it is not that those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things are subjects for deprecation, but that they are hard of attainment.</q> Well, so is poverty, not a thing to be deprecated, but hard of attainment: so that if one could bear it, there would be no reason to deprecate it. For how is it that the Apostles did not deprecate it? How is it that many even choose it, and so far from deprecating, even run to it? For that which is really a thing to be deprecated, cannot be an object of choice save to madmen. But if it be the men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophic</font></u></a> and elevated minds that betake themselves to this, as to a safe and salubrious retreat, no wonder if to the rest it wears a different appearance. For, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, the rich man seems to me to be just like a city, unwalled, situated in a plain, inviting assailants from all sides: but poverty, a secure fortress, strong as brass can make it, and the way up to it difficult. <q>And yet,</q> say you, <q>the fact is just the reverse: for these are they, who are often dragged into courts of law, these are they who are overborne and ill-treated.</q> No: not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, as poor, but those who being poor want to be rich. But I am not speaking of them, but of such as make it their study to live in poverty. For say, how comes it that nobody ever drags the brethren of the hills into courts of law? And yet if to be poor is to be a mark for oppression, those ought most of all to be dragged there, since they are poorer than all others. How comes it that nobody drags the common mendicants into the law-courts? Because they have come to the extreme of poverty. How is it that none does <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> to them, none lays vexatious informations against them? Because they abide in a stronghold too safe for that. How many think it a condition hard to struggle against, poverty, I mean, and begging! What then, I ask, is it a good thing to beg? <q>It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, if there be comfort,</q> say you; <q>if there be one to give: it is a life so free from trouble and reverses, as every one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>.</q> But I do not mean to commend this; God forbid! What I advise is the not aiming at riches.</p>
<p>For say, whom would you rather call blessed? Those who find themselves at home with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιτηδείους πρὸς ἀρετήν</span>) or those who stand aloof? Of course, those who are near. Say then, which of the two is the man to learn anything that is profitable, and to shine in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom? The former, or the latter? The first, all must see. If you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> it, satisfy yourself in this way. Fetch hither from the market-place any of the poor wretches there; let him be a cripple, lame, maimed: and then produce some other person, comely of aspect, strong in body, full of life and vigor in every part, overflowing with riches: let him be of illustrious birth, and possessed of great power. Then let us bring both these into the school of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>: which of them, I ask, is more likely to receive the things taught? The first precept, at the outset, <q>Be lowly and moderate</q> (for this is Christ's command): which will be most able to fulfil it, this one or the other? <q>Blessed are they that mourn</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:4</font></u></a></span>: which will most receive this saying? <q>Blessed are the lowly:</q> which will most listen to this? <q>Blessed are the pure in heart. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness. Blessed are they which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> for righteousness' sake</q> (ib. 8, 6, 10). Which will with ease receive these sayings? And, if you will, let us apply to all of them these rules, and see how they will fit. Is not the one inflamed and swollen all over, while the other is ever lowly minded and subdued in his whole bearing? It is quite plain. Yes, and there is a saying to that effect among those that are without: <q>(I was) a slave, Epictetus by name, a cripple in body, for poverty a very Irus, and a friend of the Immortals.</q> For how, I would ask, can it be otherwise, but that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the rich must teem with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>; folly, vainglory, numberless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lusts</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> and passion, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, iniquity, and what not? So that even for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, the former is more congenially (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιτηδεία</span>) disposed than the latter. By all means seek to ascertain which is the more pleasant: for this I see is the point everywhere discussed, whether such an one has the more enjoyable way of life. And yet even as regards this, we need not be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>; for to be near to health, is also to have much enjoyment. But whether of the two, I would ask, is best disposed (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιτήδειος</span>) to the matter now in hand, that which we will needs carry into accomplishment— our law, I mean— the poor man or the rich? Whether of them will be apt to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>? The man who has children to be provoked with, the man who has his covenants with innumerable parties, or the man who is concerned to apply for just a loaf of bread or a garment? This man has not even need of oaths, should he wish, but always lives free from cares of business; nay, more, it is often seen that he who is disciplined to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> not at all, will also despise riches; and one shall see in his whole behavior his ways all branching off from this one good habit, and leading to meekness, to contempt of riches, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>, to subduedness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, to compunction of heart. Then let us not be indolent, my beloved, but let us again show great earnestness: they who have succeeded, that they may keep the success achieved, that they be not easily caught by the receding wave, nor the refluent tide carry them back again [they too who are yet behindhand, that they may be raised up again, and strive to make up that which is wanting. And meanwhile let those who have succeeded, help those who have not been able to do the same]: and by reaching out their hands, as they would to men struggling in the deep water, receive them into the haven of no-swearing (<span>ἀ</span> <span>νωμοσίας</span>). For it is indeed a haven of safety, to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> not at all: whatever storms burst upon us, to be in no danger of sinking there: be it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, be it insult, be it passion, be it what it may, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is stayed securely; yea, though one have vented some chance word or other that ought not, and had been better not, to be spoken, yet he has laid himself under no necessity, no law. (<em>Supra</em>, Hom. ix. §5. ad. Pop. Ant. viii. §3.) See what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> did for his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath's</font></u></a> sake: he cut off the head of the Fore-runner. <q>But because of his oaths,</q> it says, <q>and because of them which sat at meat with him</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar006.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 6:26</font></u></a></span>, he cut off the head of the Prophet.

Let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> the command of the Lord: let us settle ourselves in the best of habits: that, making progress, and having achieved this and the rest of the commandments, we may obtain those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things which are promised to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts V. 34</font></u></a></p>
<p><q>Then stood there up one in the council, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11789b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharisee</font></u></a>, named <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06374b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gamaliel</font></u></a>, a doctor of the law, had in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12776c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reputation</font></u></a> among all the people, and commanded the men to be put forth a little space.</q></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06374b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gamaliel</font></u></a> was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul's</font></u></a> teacher. And one may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210114.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">well wonder</font></u></a>, how, being so right-minded in his judgment, and withal learned in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210114.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">law</font></u></a>, he did not yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>. But it cannot be that he should have continued in unbelief to the end. Indeed it appears plainly from the words he here speaks. He <q>commanded,</q> it says, <q>to put the men forth a little space [and said unto them.]</q> Observe how judiciously he frames his speech, and how he immediately at the very outset puts them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. And that he may not be suspected of taking their part, he addresses them as if he and they were of the same opinion, and does not use much vehemence, but as speaking to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210114.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> intoxicated through passion, he thus expresses himself: <q>You men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:35</font></u></a></span> Do not, he would say, go to work rashly and in a hurry. <q>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody: to whom a number of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> him, were scattered, and brought to naught.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse36" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:36</font></u></a></span> By examples he teaches them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a>; and, by way of encouragement, mentions last the man who seduced the greatest number. Now before he gives the examples, he says, <q>Take heed to yourselves;</q> but when he has cited them, then he declares his opinion, and says, <q>Refrain from these men.</q> For, says he, <q>there rose up Judas of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galilee</font></u></a> in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> him, were dispersed. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this council or this work be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, it will come to naught. But if it be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, you cannot overthrow them.</q> (al. <em>it</em>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:37-39</font></u></a></span> Then what is there, he would say, to hinder you to be overthrown? For, says he (take heed), <q>lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</q> He would dissuade them both by the consideration that the thing is impossible, and because it is not for their good. And he does not say by whom these people were destroyed, but that there they <q>were scattered,</q> and their confederacy fell away to nothing. For if, says he, it be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, what needs any ado on your part? But if it be of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, for all your ado you will not be able to overcome it. The argument is unanswerable. <q>And they were persuaded by him.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:40</font></u></a></span> How were they persuaded? So as not to slay them, but merely to scourge. For, it says, <q>And when they had called the Apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a>, and let them go.</q> See after what great works they are scourged! And again their teaching became more extended: for they taught at home and in the temple, <q>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.

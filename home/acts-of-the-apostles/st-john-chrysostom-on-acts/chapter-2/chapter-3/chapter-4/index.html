<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#000000" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts IV. 1</font></u></a></p>
<p><q>And as they spoke unto the people, there came unto them the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>, and the captain of the temple.</q></p>
<p>Ere yet they had time to take breath after their first trials, straightway they enter into others. And observe how the events are disposed. First, they were all mocked together; this was no small trial: secondly, they enter into dangers. And these two things do not take place in immediate succession; but when first the Apostles have won admiration by their two discourses, and after that have performed a notable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, thereupon it is that, after they are waxen bold, through God's disposal, they enter the lists. But I wish you to consider, how those same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, who in the case of Christ must need look out for one to deliver Him up to them, now with their own hands arrest the Apostles, having become more audacious and more impudent since the Crucifixion. In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, while it is yet struggling to the birth, is attended with some sense of shame; but when once fully born, it makes those more shameless who practise it. <q>And the captain of the temple,</q> it is said. The object again was to attach a public criminality to what was doing, and not to prosecute it as the act of private individuals: such in fact was constantly their plan of proceeding.</p>
<p><q>Being grieved that they taught the people.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:2</font></u></a></span> Not merely because they taught, but because they declared, not alone that Christ Himself was risen from the dead, but moreover, that we through Him do rise again. <q>Because they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</q> So mighty was His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210110.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Resurrection</font></u></a>, that to others also He is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of a resurrection. And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day; for it was now eventide. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:3</font></u></a></span> What impudence! They feared not the multitude; for this also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210110.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">captain</font></u></a> of the temple was with them: they had their hands still reeking with the blood of the former victim. <q>For it was now eventide,</q> it is said. It was with the wish to abate their spirit that those men did this, and guarded them; but the delay only served to make the Apostles more intrepid. And consider who these are who are arrested. They are the chiefs of the Apostles, who are now become a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210110.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pattern</font></u></a> to the rest, that they should no longer crave each other's support, nor want to be together. <q>Howbeit, many having heard the word, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:4</font></u></a></span> How was this? Did they see them in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>? Did they not behold them put in bonds? How then did they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>? Do you see the evident efficacy? And yet even those that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> already might well have become weaker. But no, it is no longer so: for Peter's sermon had laid the seed deep into them, and had taken a hold upon their understandings. Therefore were [their enemies] incensed, that they did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> them, that they made no account of their present troubles. For, say they, if He that was crucified effects such great things, and makes the lame to walk, we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> not these men either. This again is of God's ordering. For those who now <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> were more numerous than the former. Therefore it was that in their presence they bound the Apostles, to make them also more fearful. But the reverse took place. And they examine them not before the people, but privately, that the hearers may not profit by their boldness.</p>
<p><q>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01536a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Annas the High Priest</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03143b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Caiaphas</font></u></a>, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the High Priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</q> (v. 5-6.) For now along with the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> (of the times ), the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210110.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Law</font></u></a> was no longer observed. And again they set off the business with the form of a tribunal, to constitute them guilty by their iniquitous sentence. <q>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:7</font></u></a></span> And yet they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> it well; for it was because they were <q>grieved that they preached through Jesus the resurrection</q> that they arrested them. Then for what purpose do they question them? They expected the numbers present would make them recant, and thought by this means to have put all right again. Observe then what they say: <q>And by what name have ye done this? Then Peter, filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, said unto them.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:8</font></u></a></span> And now, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, call to mind Christ's saying; When they deliver you up unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a>, take ye no thought how or what thing you shall speak; for it is the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk012.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 12:11-14</font></u></a></span> So that it was a mighty Power they enjoyed. What then says Peter? <q>You rulers of the people, and elders of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> Mark the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> wisdom of the man; how full of confidence it is: he utters not a word of insult, but says with respect, <q>You rulers of the people, and elders of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, if we be this day called to account of the good deed done to the impotent man.</q> He takes them in hand right valiantly; by the opening of his speech he exposes them, and reminds them of the former things: that it is for a work of beneficence they are calling them to account. As if he had said, In all fairness we ought to have been crowned for this deed, and proclaimed benefactors; but since <q>we are even put upon our trial for a good deed done to an impotent man,</q> not a rich man, not powerful, not noble— and yet who would feel <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> in a case like this? It is a most forcible (<span>ἀ</span> <span>παγγελια</span>, al. <span>ἐ</span> <span>παγγελία</span>) way of putting the case; and he shows that they are piercing their own selves:— <q>By what means this man is made whole: be it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you all, and to all the people <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>; that by the Name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</font></u></a>:</q>— this is what would vex them most. For this was that which Christ had told the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, <q>What ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops.— That in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a>, Whom you crucified, Whom God raised from the dead, even by Him does this man stand here before you whole.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#ff0000">Acts 4:10</font></u></a></span>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:27</font></u></a></span> Think not, he says that we conceal the country, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the death. <q>Whom you crucified, Whom God raised from the dead, even by Him does this man stand before you whole.</q> Again the death, again the resurrection. <q>This is the stone,</q> he says, <q>which was set at nought of you builders, which has become the head of the corner.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:11</font></u></a></span> He reminds them also of a saying which was enough to frighten them. For it had been said, Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat021.htm#verse44" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 21:44</font></u></a></span>— Neither is there <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> in any other, <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:12</font></u></a></span> Peter says. What wounds, think you, must these words inflict on them! <q>For there is none other name,</q> he continues, <q>under heaven given among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, whereby we must be saved.</q> Here he utters also lofty words. For when the object is, not to carry some point successfully, but only to show boldness he does not spare; for he was not afraid of striking too deep. Nor does he say simply, <q>By another;</q> but, <q>Neither is there <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> in any other:</q> that is, He is able to save us. In this way he subdued their threatening.</p>
<p><q>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> men, they marvelled and they took <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of them, that they had been with Jesus.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:13</font></u></a></span> The two unlearned men beat down with their rhetoric them and the chief <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a>. For it was not they that spoke, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit. <q>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:14</font></u></a></span> Great was the boldness of the man; that even in the judgment-hall he has not left them. For had they said that the fact was not so, there was he to refute them. <q>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, saying, What are we to do to these men?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:15</font></u></a></span> See the difficulty they are in, and how the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of men again does everything. As in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, they were not able (as the saying is) to undo what is done, nor to cast it into the shade, but for all their hindering, the Faith did but gain ground the more; so was it now. <q>What shall we do?</q> O the folly! To suppose that those who had tasted of the conflict, would now take fright at it: to expect, impotent as their efforts had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> in the beginning, to effect something new, after such a specimen of oratory as had been exhibited! The more they wished to hinder, the more the business grew upon their hands. But what say they? <q>For that indeed a notable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. But that it spread no further among the people, let us straightly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of Jesus.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:16-18</font></u></a></span> See what effrontery is shown by these, and what greatness of mind by the Apostles. <q>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">.</font></q><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000"> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:19-21</font></u></a></span></font> The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> shut their mouths: they would not so much as let them finish their speech, but cut them short in the middle, most insolently. <q>For all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> God for that which was done. For the man was above forty years old, on whom this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> of healing was showed.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:22</font></u></a></span> But let us look over what has been said from the beginning.</p>
<p><q>And as they spoke unto the people, etc. Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</q> </p>

<p><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation, v. 1, 2.)</font></strong> So then at first they did all for the sake of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man's</font></u></a> opinion (or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>): but now another motive was added: that they should not be thought guilty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, as they said subsequently, <q>Do ye wish to bring this man's blood on us?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:28</font></u></a></span> O the folly! Persuaded that He was risen, and having received this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of it, they expected that He Whom death could not hold, could be cast into the shade by their machinations! What can match the folly of this! Such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>: it has no eyes for anything, but on all occasions it is thrown into perturbation. Finding themselves overborne, they felt like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> who have been outwitted: as is the case with people who have been forestalled and made a sport of in some matter. And yet they everywhere affirmed that it was God that raised Him: but it was <q>in the Name of Jesus</q> that they spoke; showing that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> was risen. <q>Through Jesus, the resurrection of the dead</q>: for they themselves also held a resurrection: a cold and puerile doctrine, indeed, but still they held it. Why this alone, was it not sufficient to induce them to do nothing to them— I mean, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a> with such boldness bore themselves in the way they did? Say, wherefore, O Jew, do you disbelieve? You ought to have attended to the sign done, and to the words, not to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> disposition of the many. <q>By their teaching the people.</q> For already they were in ill repute with them by reason of what they had done to Christ; so that they were rather increasing their own obloquy. <q>And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold until the morrow; for it was now eventide.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:3</font></u></a></span> In the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, however, they did not so; but having taken Him at midnight, they immediately led him away, and made no delay, being exceedingly in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of the multitude: whereas in the case of the Apostles here, they were bold. And they no more take them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a>, being ashamed and blushing at the thought of the former affair, lest they should also be taken to task for that.</p>
<p><q>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13634a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">scribes</font></u></a> were gathered together at Jerusalem.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:5</font></u></a></span> Again in Jerusalem: and there it is that men's blood is poured out; no reverence for their city either; <q>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01536a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Annas</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03143b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Caiaphas</font></u></a>,</q> etc. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:6</font></u></a></span> <q>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01536a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Annas</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03143b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Caiaphas</font></u></a>.</q> His maid-servant it was that questioned Peter, and he could not bear it: in his house it was that Peter denied, when Another was in bonds there: but now, when he has come into the midst of them all, see how he speaks! <q>By what name have ye done this?</q> Why do you not speak it, what it is, but keepest that out of sight? <q>By what name have ye done this?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:7</font></u></a></span> And yet he affirmed, It was not we that did it. <q>You rulers of the people,</q> etc. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#000000" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:8</font></u></a></span> Observe his wisdom: he does not say outright, <q>In the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07421a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Name of Jesus</font></u></a> we did it,</q> but how? <q>In His Name this man</q>— He does not say, <q>was made whole by us;</q> but— <q>does stand here before you whole.</q> And again, <q>If we be examined concerning the good deed done to the impotent man.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:9</font></u></a></span> He hits them hard, that they are always making a crime of such acts, finding fault with works of beneficence done to men: and he reminds them of their former doings, that <em>they</em> run to do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, and not only so, but make a crime of doing good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>. Do you observe too (in point of rhetoric) with what dignity they express themselves? Even in the use of words they were becoming expert by practice, and henceforth they were not to be beaten down. <q>Be it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you all,</q> etc. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:10</font></u></a></span> Whereby he shows them that they rather do, in spite of themselves, preach Christ; themselves extol the doctrine, by their examining and questioning. O exceeding boldness— <q>Whom you crucified! Whom God raised up</q>— this is bolder still! Think not that we hide what there is to be ashamed of. He says this all but tauntingly: and not merely says it, but dwells upon the matter. <q>This,</q> says he, <q>is the Stone which was set at naught by you builders;</q> and then he goes on to teach them, saying in addition, <q>Which is made the head of the corner</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff0000">Acts 4:11</font></u></a></span>; that is to say, that the Stone is indeed approved! Great was the boldness they now had, in consequence of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>. And when there was need to teach, observe how they speak and allege many prophecies; but when the point was to use boldness of speech, then they only speak peremptorily. Thus <q>Neither,</q> says he, <q>is there any other name under heaven given among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> whereby we must be saved.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:12</font></u></a></span> It is manifest to all, he says, because not to us alone was that Name given; he cites even themselves as witnesses. For, since they asked, <q>In what name did ye it?</q> <q>In Christ's,</q> says he: there is none other name. How is it that you ask? On all hands this is palpable. <q>For there exists not another name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.</q> This is the language of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> which has renounced (<span>κατεγνωκυίας</span>) this present life. His exceeding out-spokenness proves here, that when he speaks in lowly terms of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, he does it not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, but of wise forbearance (<span>συγκαταβαίνων</span>): but now that it was the fitting time, he speaks not in lowly terms: by this very thing intending to strike dismay into them. Behold another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> not less than the former. <q>And beholding the boldness of Peter and John,</q> etc. <q>And they took <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of them that they had been with Jesus.</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:13</font></u></a></span> Not without a meaning has the Evangelist set down this passage; but in saying, <q>they recognized them that they had been with Jesus,</q> he means, in His Passion: for only these were [with Him] at that time, and then indeed they had seen them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a>, dejected: and this it was that most surprised them: the greatness of the change. For in fact <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01536a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Annas</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03143b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Caiaphas</font></u></a> with their company were there, and these then also had stood by Him, and their boldness now amazed them. <q>And beholding the boldness.</q> For not only their words; their very bearing showed it; that they should stand there so intrepidly to be tried in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> like this, and with uttermost peril impending over them! Not only by their words, but by their gesture also, and their look and voice, and, in short, by everything about them, they manifested the boldness with which they confronted the people. From the things they uttered, they marvelled, perhaps: <q>that they were unlearned and common men:</q> for one may be unlearned, yet not a common or private man, and a common man, yet not unlearned. <q>Having perceived,</q> it says. Whence? From what they said? Peter does not draw out long speeches, but then by his very manner and method (<span>τἥς ἀπαγγελίας καὶ τἥς συνθήκης</span>) he declares his confidence. <q>And they recognized them that they had been with Jesus.</q> Which circumstance made them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that it was from Him they had learned these things, and that they did all in the character of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. But not less than the voice of these, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> uttered a voice of its own: and that sign itself stopped their mouths. [<q>And beholding the man,</q> etc.] So that they would have been peremptory (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πέσκηψαν</span>) with them, if the man had not been with them. <q>We cannot deny it.</q> So that they would have denied it, if the thing had not been so: if the testimony had not been that of the people in general. <q>But that it spread no further among the people.</q></p>

But such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>: everywhere it is shamed. <q>Let us strictly threaten them.</q> What do you say? Threaten? And expect ye to stop the preaching? And yet all beginnings are hard and trying. You slew the Master, and did not stop it: and now, if you threaten, do ye expect to turn us back? The imprisonment did not prevail with us to speak submissively, and shall you prevail? <q>And they called them, and commanded them,</q> etc. (v. 18, 19.) It had been much better for them to let them go. <q>And Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, judge ye.</q> When the terror was abated (for that command was tantamount to their being dismissed), then also the Apostles speak more mildly: so far were they from mere <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bravery</font></u></a>: <q>Whether it be right,</q> says he: and <q>We cannot [but speak]. Whether it be right in the sight of God to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> you rather than God.</q></p>

And once more they confirm the fact of His Resurrection. <q>For we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard:</q> so that we are witnesses who have a right to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. <q>So when they had further threatened them.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:21</font></u></a></span> Again they threatened in vain. <q>They let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> God for that which was done.</q> So then the people <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but these endeavored to destroy them: such fighters against God were they! Whereby they made them more conspicuous and illustrious. <q>For My strength,</q> it is said, <q>is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co012.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 12:9</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Already these as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">martyrs</font></u></a> have borne testimony: set in the battle against all, they said, <q>We cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard.</q> If the things we speak be false, reprehend them; if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, why do you hinder? Such is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>! Those, in perplexity, these in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>: those covered with exceeding shame, these doing all with boldness: those in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, these in confidence. For who, I would ask, were the frightened? Those who said, <q>That it spread no further among people,</q> or these who said, <q>we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard?</q> And these had a delight, a freedom of speech, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> surpassing all; those a despondency, a shame, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; for they feared the people. But these were not afraid of those; on the contrary, while these spoke what they would, those did not what they would. Which were in chains and dangers? Was it not these last?</p>
<p>Let us then hold fast to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; let not these words end only in delight, and in a certain elevation of the spirits. This is not the theatre, for singers (<span>κιθαρώδων</span>), and tragedians, and musicians (<span>κιθαριστὥν</span>), where the fruit consists only in the enjoyment and where the enjoyment itself passes with the passing day. Nay, would that it were enjoyment alone, and not mischief also with the enjoyment! But so it is: each man carries home with him much of what he has witnessed there, sticking to him like the infection of a plague: and one indeed, of the younger sort, having culled such snatches of song here and there of those satanic plays, as he could fix in his memory, goes singing them about the house: while another, a senior, and forsooth too staid for such levity, does not this indeed, but what is there spoken, both the preachments and the very words, he remembers it all; and another again, some filthy and absurd ditty. From this place you depart, taking nothing with you.— We have laid down a law— nay, not we: God forbid! For it is said, <q>Call no man your master upon the earth</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:8</font></u></a></span>; Christ has laid down a law that none should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>. Now, say, what has been done with regard to this law? For I will not cease speaking of it; <q>lest,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>if I come again, I must not spare.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 13:2</font></u></a></span> I ask then, have you laid the matter to heart? Have you thought of it seriously? Have you been in earnest about it, or must we again take up the same subject? Nay, rather, whether you have or not, we will resume it, that you may think seriously about it, or, if you have laid it to heart, may again do this the more surely, and exhort others also. With what then, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, with what shall we begin? Shall it be with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>? For indeed this also is to our shame, that the precepts of the Law, which we ought to surpass, we do not even thus observe! For we ought not to be hearing such matters as these: these are precepts adapted to the poor Jewish level (<span>τἥς ᾿Ιουδαἲκἥς εὐτελείας</span>): <em>we</em> ought to be hearing those counsels of perfection; <q>Cast away your property, stand courageously, and give up your life in behalf of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, scorn all the goods of earth, have nothing in common with this present life; if any wrong you, do him good; if any defraud you, bless him; if any revile you, show him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>; be above everything.</q> (S. Ambros. <em>de Off.</em> i. 2.) These and such as these are what we ought to be hearing. But here are we discoursing about swearing; and our case is just the same as if, when a person ought to be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a>, one should take him away from the great masters, and set him to spell syllables letter by letter! Just think now what a disgrace it would be for a man having a flowing beard, and with staff in hand, and cope on shoulders, to go to school with children, and be set the same tasks with them: would it not be above measure ridiculous? And yet the ridicule which belongs to us is even greater. For not as the difference between <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> and the spelling-lesson, so is that between the Jewish polity and ours: no indeed, but as the difference between <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> and men. Say now, if one could fetch down an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angel</font></u></a> from heaven, and should bid him stand here and listen to our preaching, as one whose duty it is to conform himself thereto, would it not be shameful and preposterous? But if to be yet, like children, under teaching about these things be ridiculous; what must it be, not even to attend to these things: how great the condemnation, how great the shame! To be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a> still, and to have to learn that it is not right to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>! However, let us put up with that, lest we incur even worse ridicule.</p>
<p>Well, then, let us speak to you today from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>. What does it tell us? <q>Accustom not your mouth to swearing; neither use yourself to the naming of the Holy One.</q> And why? <q>For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that swears.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir023.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 23:10</font></u></a></span> See the discernment of this wise man. He did not say, <q>Accustom not to swearing</q> your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, but <q>your mouth</q>; because being altogether an affair of the mouth, thus it is easily remedied. For at last it becomes a habit without intention; as for instance, there are many who entering the public baths, as soon as they have passed the threshold, cross <span>Hom. in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:7</font></u></a></span> themselves (<span>σφραγίζονται</span>). This the hand has got to do, without any one's bidding, by force of habit. Again, at the lighting of a candle, often when the mind is intent on something else, the hand makes the sign. In the same way also the mouth, without concurrence of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, articulates the word, from mere habit, and the whole affair is in the tongue. <q>Neither use yourself,</q> he says, <q>to the naming of the Holy One. For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that swears.</q> He speaks not here of false oaths, but he cuts down all oaths, and to them also assigns their punishment. Why then, swearing is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. For such in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; full of all these ulcers, all these scars. But you do not see them? Yes, this is the mischief of it; and yet you might see if you wished; for God has given you eyes. With eyes of this kind did the Prophet see, when he said, <q>My wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa037.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 38:5</font></u></a></span> We have despised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, we have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> that good Name, we have trodden Christ under foot, we have lost all reverence, none names the Name of God with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. Yet if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> any one, even at his name you start to your feet; but God you thus continually invoke, and make nothing of it. Call upon Him for the benefit of your enemy; call upon Him for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> of your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; then he will be present, then you will delight Him; whereas now you provoke Him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>. Call upon Him as Stephen did; <q>Lord,</q> he said, <q>lay not this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> to their charge.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act007.htm#verse59" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 7:59</font></u></a></span> Call upon Him as did the wife of Elkanah, with tears and sobs, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa001.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 1:10</font></u></a></span> I prevent you not, rather I earnestly exhort you to it. Call upon him as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> called upon Him, yea, cried, interceding for those who had driven him into banishment. For you to make mention at random of any person of consideration, is taken as an insult: and do you bandy God about in your talk, in season, out of season? I do not want to hinder you from keeping God always in your mind: nay, this I even desire and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> for, only that you should do this, so as to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> Him. Great good would this have done us, if we had called upon God only when we ought, and for what we ought. And why, I would ask, were such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> wrought in the Apostles' times, and not in ours? And yet it is the same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the same Name. But no, the case is not the same. For then they called upon Him only for those objects which I have mentioned; whereas we call upon Him not for these, but quite other purposes.— If a man refuse to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> you, and that is why you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, say to him, <q>Believe me:</q> however, if you will needs make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> by yourself. I say this, not to set up a law against Christ's law; God forbid; for it is said. Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:37</font></u></a></span>: but by way of coming down to your present level, that I may more easily lead you to the practice of this commandment, and divert you from this tyrannical habit. How many who have done well in other respects, have been undone by these practices! Shall I tell you why it was permitted the ancients to take oaths? (for to take false oaths, was not permitted to them either.) Because they swore by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>. But are you not ashamed to rest in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, by which they in their infirmity were led on to something better? It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>, when I take a Gentile in hand, I do not immediately lay this injunction upon him, but in the first place I exhort him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Christ; but if the believer, who has both learned Him and heard Him, must needs crave the same forbearance with the Gentile, what is the use, what the gain (of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christianity</font></u></a>?)— But the habit is strong, and you cannot detach yourself from it? Well then, since the tyranny of habit is so great, transfer it into another channel. And how is this to be done? You will ask. What I have said often, I say also now; let there be many monitors (<span>λογισταὶ</span>), let there be many examiners and censors (<span>ἐ</span> <span>ξετασταὶ</span>, <span>δοκιμασταί</span>). Say, if you chance to put on your mantle inside out, you allow your servant to correct your mistake, and are ashamed to learn of him, although there is much to be ashamed of in this; and here when you are getting hurt to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, are you ashamed to be taught better by another? You suffer your menial to put your dress in order, and to fasten your shoes, and will you not endure him that would put your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> in order? Let even your menial, your child, your wife, your friend, your kinsman, your neighbor, be your teachers on this point. For as when a wild beast is hunted down from all sides, it is impossible for it to escape; so he that has so many to watch him, so many to reprove him, who is liable to be struck at from all sides, cannot help being on his guard. The first day he will find it hard to put up with, and the second, and the third; but after that it will come easier, and, the fourth passed, there will not even be anything to do. Make the experiment, if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> me; take it into consideration, I beseech you. It is not a trifling matter to be wrong in, nor yet to come right in; on both sides it is great for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and for good. May the good be effected, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to Whom with the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priests</font></u></a> and elders had said unto them.</q></p>
<p>Not for their own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> did they tell the tale— how should such be their motive?— but what they displayed was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> therein exhibited of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.

Observe with what exquisite propriety their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> are framed: thus, when they besought to be shown who was meet for the Apostleship, they said, <q>You, Lord, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08675a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the heart of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, show:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act001.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 1:24</font></u></a></span> for it was a subject for Prescience there: but here, where the thing needed was that the mouths of their adversaries should be stopped, they speak of lordship; wherefore they begin thus: Lord, <q>(<span>Δέσποτα</span>) the God that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: Who, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> through the mouth of Your servant, David our father, said, Why did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> rage, and the people <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> vain things?

Moreover, he is just about to enter upon the narrative of Sapphira and Ananias, and with a view to show the detestable conduct of that pair, he first discourses of the noble behavior of the rest.

It is not to be said, that though indeed they maintained the rest, yet they did it with the feeling that the means whereof they maintained them were still their own. No, the admirable circumstance is this, that they first alienated their property, and so maintained the rest, on purpose that the maintenance might not come as of their own private means, but as of the common property. <q>For as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the price of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the Apostles' feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</q></p>

Observe how they do not cast themselves upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a>, but when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptations</font></u></a> present themselves, with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> endure them.

Just as Christ Himself said to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, <q>If I by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a> do cast out devils:</q> behold the Father also speaks by the Spirit.

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:25</font></u></a></span> Scripture is wont thus to speak of one as of many. <q>For of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, Lord, against Your Holy Child Jesus, Whom You anointed, both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07289c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Herod</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pontius Pilate</font></u></a>,</q> etc. </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:27</font></u></a></span> Observe how, even in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, they circumstantially describe the Passion, and refer all to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.— That is, Not they had power to do this: but Thou did it all, Thou that permitted, that dost call to account, and yet brought to accomplishment, Thou the All-skilful and Wise, that served You of Your enemies for Your own pleasure. </p>

And this they said not because they would themselves deprecate any hardship, but for the preaching's sake. For they do not say, <q>and deliver us out of dangers;</q> but what? <q>And grant unto Your servants, that with all boldness they may speak Your word.</q> You Who brought to pass the former designs, bring these also to accomplishment.

And again, another <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> says, <q>The earth was shaken, and did tremble at the presence of the Lord.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa017.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 18:7</font></u></a>; lxviii, 8</span> And God did this, both to make it more awful, and to lead them on to a courageous trust. <q>And they were all filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</q> They gained increased boldness. As it was the beginning (of their work), and they had besought a sensible sign for their persuasion (<span>πρὸς τὸ πεισθἥναι αὐτους</span>)— but after this we nowhere find the like happening— therefore great was the encouragement they received. In fact, they had no means of proving that He was risen, save by miraculous signs. So that it was not only their own assurance (<span>ἀ</span> <span>σφαλείαν</span>) that they sought: but that they might not be put to shame, but that they might speak with boldness. <q>The place was shaken,</q> and that made them all the more unshaken. For this is sometimes a token of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, sometimes of favor and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, but on the present occasion, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. For in those times it took place in an unusual manner. Thus, at the Crucifixion, the earth was shaken: and the Lord Himself says, <q>Then there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:7</font></u></a></span> But then the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> of which it was a sign was against the adversaries: as for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, it filled them with the Spirit. Observe, even the Apostles, after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, are <q>filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> <q>And the multitudes of them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>,</q> etc.</p>

<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:32</font></u></a></span> Great, you perceive, is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of this thing, seeing their was need of this (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>) even in that Company. For this is the foundation of all that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, this of which he now for the second time makes mention, exhorting all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> to the contempt of riches: <q>Neither said any of them that anything of the things he possessed was his own,</q> <q>but they had all things common.</q> For that this was in consequence not merely of the miraculous signs, but of their own purpose, is manifest by the case of Sapphira and Ananias. <q>And with great power gave the Apostles <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>,</q> etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:33</font></u></a></span> Not in word, but with power the Apostles exhibited their testimony of the Resurrection: just as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, <q>And my preaching was not with persuasive words of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> wisdom, but with manifestation of the Spirit and of power.</q> And it is not merely, With power, but, <q>With great power.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co002.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 2:4</font></u></a></span> <q>And great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>,</q> it says, <q>was upon them all; for neither was there any among them that lacked.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:34</font></u></a></span> This is why the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> (was upon them all,) for that <q>there was none that lacked:</q> that is, from the exceeding ardor of the givers, none was in want. For they did not give in part, and in part reserve: nor yet in giving all, give it as their own. And they lived moreover in great abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a goodly order. <q>For as many as were possessors,</q> etc. And with great respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles' feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners, that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from private, property. This was also a help to them against vain-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>. If this were done now, we should live more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the common stock— in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture— for of course it is not possible to speak exactly— that supposing all here, men and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions, houses—for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at liberty—perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what number of <q><em>juga</em></q> (yokes) is our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a>? Shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? Then what thousands (of pounds) of gold would be collected! And what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand. Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would be! And yet if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could be spent? Would not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?— But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? By taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and agreement make increase. The dwellers in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04340c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">monasteries</font></u></a> live just as the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? Was ever any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems, people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this, then indeed we should boldly venture upon this plan (<span>τοὕ πράγματος</span>). What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> too, think you, would there not be! For if at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God there are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believers</font></u></a> everywhere throughout the world? What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one: we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but make fair progress, I trust in God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.</p>
<p>In the first place, as regards that law about swearing: accomplish that; establish it firmly: and let him that has kept it make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> him that has not, and call him to account withal and rebuke him sternly.

But God forbid that any such should be found among us; rather may it appear, that all have strictly kept this spiritual watchword.

For what a good thing it is that we should have this to be our cognizance both here and in a foreign land! What a weapon this, against the very head of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>! A mouth that cannot <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> will soon both engage God in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, and smite the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> a deadly blow. A mouth that cannot <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> will also be incapable of using insulting language. Cast out this fire from your tongue, as you would from a house: this fire, drag it out. Give your tongue a little rest: make the sore less virulent. Yea, I beseech you, do this, that I may go on to set you another lesson: for as long as this is not rightly done, I dare not pass on to any other. Let this lesson be got perfectly, and you shall have a consciousness of the achievement, and then I will introduce you to other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, or rather not I, but Christ. Implant in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> this good thing, and little by little you shall be a paradise of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, far better than that paradise of old. No serpent among you, no deadly tree, nor any such thing. Fix this habit deep. If this be done, not ye only that are present shall be benefitted, but all that are in all the world; and not they alone, but those that are to succeed hereafter. For a good habit having once entered, and being kept by all, will be handed on to long ages, and no circumstances shall be able to erase it. If he that gathered sticks on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sabbath</font></u></a> was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>—the man that is doing a far more heinous work than that gathering, the man that is amassing a load of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, for such is the multitude of oaths, what shall he undergo? What shall he not have to endure? You will receive great assistance from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, if this be well achieved by you. If I were to say, Be not abusive, immediately you will plead to me your indignation; should I say, Be not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a>, you will urge some other excuse. But in this case you have nothing of the kind to say. On which account I began with the easy precepts, which indeed is also the uniform practice in all arts. And thus one comes to the higher duties, by learning first those which are easier far. How easy it is you will see, when by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God having succeeded in this, you shall receive another precept.</p>
<p>Put it in my power to speak out boldly, in the presence both of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and, above all, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Yea, I entreat you by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, by the pangs wherewith I have travailed for your birth, <q>my little children.</q> I will not add what follows, <q>of whom I travail in birth again;</q> nor will I say, <q>until Christ be formed in you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal004.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 4:19</font></u></a></span>. For I am persuaded, that Christ has been formed in you. Other language I will use towards you; <q>My brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> and my crown.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 4:1</font></u></a></span> Believe me that I shall use no other language. If at this moment there were placed upon my head ten thousand richly-jewelled royal crowns, they could not give me the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> which I feel at your growth in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a>; or rather, I do not think the monarch himself has such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, as that wherewith I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> over you. Let him have come home, victorious over all the nations at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with him, let him have won many other crowns besides the crown of his right; and receive other diadems as tokens of his victory: I do not think he would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> over his trophies, as I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a> over your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul's</font></u></a> progress. For I exult, as if I had a thousand crowns on my head; and well may I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>. For if by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God you achieve this good habit, you will have gained a thousand battles far more difficult than his; by wrestling and fighting with malicious <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a>, and fiendish spirits, with the tongue, not with sword, but by the will. For consider how much is gained, if so be that you do succeed! You have eradicated, first, a heinous habit; secondly, an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> conceit, the source of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, namely, the opinion that the thing is indifferent and can do no hurt; thirdly, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>; fourthly, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>; for all these are the offspring of swearing. Nay, hence you will acquire a sure footing in the way to all other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtues</font></u></a>. For as when children learn their letters, they learn not them alone, but by means of them are gradually taught to read; so shall it be with you. That <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> conceit will no longer deceive you, you will not say, This is indifferent; you will no longer speak by mere habit, but will manfully stand against all, so that having perfected in all parts that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> which is after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, you may reap <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> blessings, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and loving-kindness of His Only-Begotten Son, to Whom with the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the hour of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, being the ninth hour.</q></p>
<p>Everywhere we find these two Apostles in great harmony together. <q>To him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Simon Peter</font></u></a> beckoned.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh013.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 13:24</font></u></a></span> These two also came together to the sepulchre. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh020.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 20:3</font></u></a> <em>et seq.</em></span> And concerning John, Peter said unto Christ, <q>And what shall this man do?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh021.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 21:21</font></u></a></span> Now as for the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, the writer of this book omits them; but he mentions the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> by which they were all put in commotion. Observe again that they do not come to them purposely; so clear were they of ambition, so closely did they imitate their Master. Why now did they go up to the temple? Did they still live as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>? No, but for expediency (<span>χρησίμως</span>). A miraculous sign again takes place, which both confirms the converts, and draws over the rest; and such, as they were a sign for having wrought. The disease was in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of the man, and baffled the art of medicine. He had been forty years lame <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:20</font></u></a></span>, as the writer says afterwards, and no one during all that time had cured him. And the most obstinate diseases are those which are born with men. It was a great calamity, insomuch that even to provide for himself his necessary sustenance was impossible for him. The man was conspicuous both from the place, and from his malady. Hear how the matter is related. <q>And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> of them that entered into the temple.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:2</strong></font></u></a></span> He sought to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, and he did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> who the men were. <q>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.</q> (v. 3, 4.) Yet, not even so were the man's thoughts elevated, but he persisted in his importunity. For such is poverty; upon a refusal, it compels people still to persist. Let this put us to shame who fall back in our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>. But observe, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, Peter's gentleness: for he said, <q>Look on us.</q> So <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> did their very bearing, of itself, betoken their character. <q>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have I give you.</q> (v. 5-6.) He did not say, I give you something much better than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210108.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">silver</font></u></a> or gold: but what? <q>In the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</font></u></a>, rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:7</strong></font></u></a></span> Such was also the way of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Often He healed by word, often by an act, often also He stretched forth the hand, where men were somewhat weak in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, that the cure might not appear to be spontaneous. <q>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.</q> This act made manifest the Resurrection, for it was an image of the Resurrection. <q>And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:8</strong></font></u></a></span> Perhaps it was by way of trying himself that he put it thus to further <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a>, whether perchance the thing done might not be to no purpose. His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210108.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">feet</font></u></a> were weak; it was not that he had lost them. Some say that he did not even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to walk. <q>And entered with them into the temple.</q> Of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> it was marvellous. The Apostles do not urge him; but of his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210108.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">accord</font></u></a> he follows, by the act of following pointing out his benefactors. <q>And leaping and praising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>;</q> not admiring them, but God that wrought by them. The man was grateful.</p>
<p>[<q>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple,</q> etc.] You observe how they continued in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>. <q>The ninth hour:</q> there they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> together. [<q>And a certain man,</q> etc.] The man was in the act of being carried at that instant. [<q>Whom they laid daily:</q>] (his bearers carried him away:) [<q>at the gate,</q> etc.] just when people went into the temple. And that you may not suppose that they carried him for some other purpose, but that it was in order that he might receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>, hear what the writer says: <q>so that he might receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> of those entering into the temple.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong><font size="4">Recapitulation</font></strong> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:1-8</strong></font></u></a></span> And this is the reason why he also makes mention of the places, to give evidence of what he relates. <q>And how was it,</q> you may ask, <q>that they did not present him to Christ?</q> Perhaps they were certain unbelieving men, that haunted the temple, as in fact neither did they present him to the Apostles, when they saw them entering, after having done such great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>. <q>He asked,</q> it is written, <q>to receive an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:3</strong></font></u></a></span> Their bearing marked them as certain devout and righteous men. [<q>And Peter fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said,</q> etc.] (v. 4-5.) And observe how John is everywhere silent, while Peter makes excuse for him also; <q>Silver and gold,</q> he says, <q>have I none.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:6</strong></font></u></a></span> He does not say, I have none here, as we are wont to speak, but absolutely, I have none. <q>What then?</q> he might say, <q>do you take no notice of me, your suppliant?</q> Not so, but of what I have, receive thou. Do you remark how unassuming Peter is, how he makes no display even to the object of his beneficence? [<q>In the name,</q> etc. <q>And he took him by the hand,</q> etc.] </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:7</strong></font></u></a></span> And the mouth and the hand did all. Such sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> were the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>; lame, and the right thing being to ask for health, these same ask for money, grovelling on the ground: for this it was that they beset the temple— to get money. What then does Peter? He did not despise him; he did not look about for some rich subject; he did not say, If the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> is not done to some great one (<span>εἰς ἐκεἵνον</span>), nothing great is done: he did not look for some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> from him, no, nor heal him in the presence of people; for the man was at the entrance, not where the multitude were, that is, within. But Peter sought no such object; nor upon entering did he proclaim the matter: no, it was by his bearing that he attracted the lame man to ask. And the wonder is, that he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> so readily. For those who are set free from diseases of long standing, hardly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> their very eyesight. Once healed, he remains with the Apostles, giving thanks to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. <q>And he entered,</q> it is said, <q>with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:8</strong></font></u></a></span> Observe how restless he is, in the eagerness of his delight, at the same time shutting the mouths of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. Also, that he leaped, was to prevent the suspicion of hypocrisy; for after all, this was beyond the possibility of deception. For if previously he was totally unable to walk, even when hunger pressed hard (and indeed he would not have chosen to share with his bearers the proceeds of his begging, if he had been able to manage for himself), this holds still more in the present case. And how should he have feigned in behalf of those who had given him no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a>? But the man was grateful, even after his recovery. And thus on either side his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> is shown, both by his thankfulness, and by the recent event.</p>
<p>He was so well known to all, that <q>they recognized him. And all the people,</q> it says, <q>saw him walking and praising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and they recognized (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πεγίνωσκον</span>) that it was he which sat for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> at the Beautiful gate of the temple.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:9</strong></font></u></a></span> It is well said, <q>they recognized,</q> inasmuch as he was one unknown now by reason of what had happened: for we use this term with regard to objects, which we find a difficulty in recognizing. [<q>And they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</q>] Needs must it be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> that the name of Christ remits <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, seeing it produces even such effects as this. (<q>And as he held Peter and John, all the people came together at the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:11</strong></font></u></a></span> From his good feelings and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards the Apostles, the lame man would not leave them; perhaps he was thanking them openly, and praising them. <q>And all the people,</q> it is said, <q>ran together unto them. And when Peter saw them, he answered.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>
<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:12</strong></font></u></a></span> Again it is he who acts, and addresses the people.</p>
<p>And in the former instance, it was the circumstance of the tongues that aroused them to hearing, now it was this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>; then, he took occasion to speak from their accusations now, from their supposition. Let us then consider, in what this address differs from the former, and in what it agrees with that. The former was held in a house, before any one has come over, and before they themselves have wrought anything; this, when all are wondering, and the healed man is standing by; when none <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, as in the other case where some said <q>These men are full of new wine.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act012.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 12:13</font></u></a></span> At the one, he was surrounded by all the Apostles as he spoke; but at this, he has John alone; for by this time he is bold, and become more energetic. Such is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; once started, it advances, and never stops. Observe also how it was divinely ordered, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> should take place in the temple, that others also might wax bold, while the Apostles work not in holes (<span>εἰς καταδύσεις</span>) and corners, and in secret: though not in the interior of the temple either, where the greater number were. How then, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, was it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>? The man himself who was healed proclaimed the benefit. For there was no reason why he should lie, nor why he should have joined a different set of people. Either then it was because of the spaciousness of the place, that he there wrought the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a>, or because the spot was retired. And observe the event. They went up for one object, and they accomplished another. Thus also did Cornelius: he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayed</font></u></a> and fasted * * *. But hitherto they always call Him, <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a>.</q> <q>In the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</font></u></a>,</q> said Peter, walk. For in the first instance, the thing required was, that He should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> in.</p>
<p>Let us not, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, give over at the beginning of the story: and if one has named some particular achievement of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and then has dropped it for awhile, let us begin over again. If we get into the right mood (<span>ἐ</span> <span>ν ἕξει</span>), we shall soon arrive at the end, soon reach the summit. For earnestness, it is said, begets earnestness, and dulness begets dulness. He who has effected some little reformation, thereby receives encouragement to approach greater things, and thence again to go on something more than that; and just as it is with fire, the more wood it lays hold on, the more vehement it becomes, so likewise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>, the more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pious</font></u></a> reflections it kindles, the more effectually is it armed against their opposites. As, for example: There are set in us, like so many thorns, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsehood</font></u></a> hypocrisy, deceit, dishonesty, abusiveness, scoffing, buffoonery, indecency, scurrility; again under another head, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, rapacity, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03190c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">calumny</font></u></a>, insidiousness; again, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>, uncleanness, lewdness, fornication, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a>; again, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>, emulation, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, rancor, revenge, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemy</font></u></a>, and numberless others. If we effect a reformation in the first instances, not only in them will the success have been achieved, but through them in the following cases also. For reason has then gained more strength to overthrow those other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vices</font></u></a>. For instance, if he, who has frequently <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a>, once extirpates that satanic habit, he has not only gained this point, but a habit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a> in other respects will have been brought in. For no one, I suppose, averse to swearing would easily consent to do any other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> act; he will feel a reverence for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> already acquired. Just as the man who wears a beautiful robe, will blush to roll himself in the mire; so is it also here. From this beginning he will come to learn not to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, not to strike, not to insult. For if once he has come right in little matters, the whole affair is done. Often, however, something of this sort takes place, that a person has once reformed, and then again through carelessness falls back into the old <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> but too readily, so that the case becomes irremediable. For instance, we have made it a law to ourselves not to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>; we have got on well, for some three, or even four days; after that being hard put to it, we scattered away the whole of our collected gain; we then fall into indolence and recklessness. Still it is not right to give over; one must set to work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealously</font></u></a> again. For it is said, he that has built up a house, and then sees his building pulled down, will have less spirit for building again. Yes, but for all this, one must not be dispirited, but must once more set to work <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zealously</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Let us then lay down daily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> for ourselves. For a time let us begin with the easier. Let us retrench all that superfluity of paths, and put a bridle on our tongues; let no one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Here is no outlay, here is no fatigue, here is no cost of time. It is sufficient to will, and all is done. It is a matter of habit. I beseech and entreat you, let us contribute thus much of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a>. Tell me, if I had bid you contribute your money, would not each one of you readily cast in according to his ability? If you saw me in extreme danger, would you not, if it had been possible, have cut off your own flesh to give me? Well, I am in danger now, and in great danger, such indeed that, were I withal confined to a dungeon, or had I received ten thousand stripes, or were a convict in the mines, I could not suffer more. Reach me then the hand. Consider how great is the danger, that I should not have been able to reform this which is least: I say <q>least</q> in regard to the labor required. What shall I have to say hereafter, when thus called to account? <q>Why did you not remonstrate? Why did you not enjoin? Why did you not lay the law before them? Why did you not check the disobedient?</q> It will not be enough for me to say, that I did admonish. It will be answered, <q>You ought to have used more vehement rebuke; since Eli also admonished.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 2:24</font></u></a></span> But God forbid I should compare you with Eli's sons. Indeed, he did admonish them and say, <q>Nay, my sons, do not so; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> is the report that I hear of you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa003.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 3:13</font></u></a></span> But subsequently the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says, that he did not admonish his sons: since he did not admonish them severely, or with threats. For is it not strange indeed, that in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">synagogues</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are in such force, and whatever the teacher enjoins is performed; while here we are thus despised and rejected? It is not my own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that I care for (my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> is your good report), but it is for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. Every day we lift up our voice, and shout in your ears. But there is none to hear. Still we take no strong measures. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> we shall have to give an account at the coming Day of this excessive and unseasonable leniency.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with a loud and clear voice, I proclaim to all and testify, that those who are notorious for this transgression, who utter words which come <q>of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:37</font></u></a></span> (for such is swearing,) shall not step over the threshold of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Let this present month be the time allowed you for reforming in this matter. Talk not to me, <q>Necessity of business compels me to use oaths, else people do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> me.</q> To begin with this, retrench those oaths which come merely of habit. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> many will laugh, but it is better to be laughed at now, than wept for hereafter. They will laugh, who are mad. For who, I ask, in his right mind would laugh at the keeping of the commandment? But suppose they do; why, it will not be at us, but at Christ, that such men will laugh. You shudder at the word! I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> you would. Now if this law were of my making, at me would be the laughing; but if Another be the Lawgiver, the jeering passes over to Him. Yes, and Christ was once spit upon, and smitten with the palm, smitten upon the face. Now also He bears with this, and it is no wonder (<span>οὐδὲν ἀπεικὸς</span>)! For this, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> is prepared; for this, the worm that dies not. Behold, again I say and testify; let him laugh that will, let him scoff that lists. Hereunto are we set, to be laughed at and mocked, to suffer all things. We are <q>the offscouring</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co004.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 4:13</font></u></a></span> or the world, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a> says. If any man refuse to conform to this order, that man I, by my word, as with a trumpet's blast, do prohibit to set foot over the Church's threshold, be he prince, be he even the crowned head. Either depose me from this station, or if I am to remain, expose me not to danger. I cannot bear to ascend this throne, without effecting some great reformation. For if this be impossible, it is better to stand below. Nothing more wretched than a ruler who does his people no good. Do exert yourselves, and attend to this, I entreat you; and let us strive, and of a surety more will come of it. Fast, entreat God (and we will do the same with you) that this pernicious habit may be eradicated. It is no great matter, to become teachers to the world; no small <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> to have it said everywhere, that really in this city there is not a man that swears. If this come to pass, you will receive the reward not only of your own good works; indeed what I am to you, this you will become to the world. Assuredly others also will emulate you; assuredly you will be a candle set upon a candlestick.</p>
<p>And is this, you will say, the whole matter? No, this is not all, but this is a beginning of other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtues</font></u></a>. He who swears not, will certainly attain unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a> in other respects, whether he will or not, by dint of self-respect and awe. But you will urge that most men do not keep to it, but fall away. Well, better one man that does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the Lord, than ten thousand transgressors. In fact, hereby is everything subverted, everything turned upside down, I mean, because after the fashion of the Theatre we desire numbers not a select number. For what indeed will a multitude be able to profit? Would you learn that it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>, not the numbers, which make the multitude? Lead out to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> ten hundred thousand men, and one saint, and let us see who achieves the most? Joshua the son of Nun went out to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a>, and alone achieved all; the rest were of no use. Would you see, beloved, that the great multitude, when it does not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, is no better than a thing of naught? I wish indeed, and desire, and with pleasure would be torn in pieces, to adorn the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> with a multitude, yea, but a select multitude; yet if this be impossible, that the few should be select, is my desire. Do you not see, that it is better to possess one precious stone, than ten thousand farthing pieces? Do you not see that it is better to have the eye sound, than to be loaded with flesh, and yet deprived of sight? Do you not see that it is better to have one healthy sheep, than ten thousand with the murrain; that fine children, though few, are better than many children diseased withal; that in the Kingdom there will be few, but in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> many? What have I to do with a multitude? What profit therein? None. Rather they are a plague to the rest. It is as if one who had the option of ten healthy <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> or ten thousand sick folks, should take to himself the latter in addition to the ten. The many who do nothing well, will avail us only for punishment hereafter, and disgrace for the time being. For no one will urge it as a point in our favor that we are many; we shall be blamed for being unprofitable. In fact, this is what men always tell us, when we say, We are many; <q>aye, but bad,</q> they answer.</p>
<p>Behold again: I give warning, and proclaim with a loud voice, let no one think it a laughing matter: I will exclude and prohibit the disobedient; and as long as I sit on this throne, I will give up not one of its rights. If any one depose me from it, then I am no longer responsible; as long as I am responsible, I cannot disregard them; on account not of my own punishment, but of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. For I do exceedingly long for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. To advance it, I endure pain and vexation. But yield your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>, that both here and hereafter you may receive a plentiful reward, and that we may in common reap <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> blessings; through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of the only-begotten <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>; to Whom with the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<p><q>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> we have made this man to walk?</q></p>
<p>There is greater freedom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210109.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">speech</font></u></a> in this harangue, than in the former. Not that he was afraid on the former occasion, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> whom he addressed there, being jesters and scoffers, would not have borne it. Hence in the beginning of that address he also bespeaks their attention by his preamble; <q>Be this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you, and hearken to my words.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:14</font></u></a></span> But here there is no need of this management. (<span>κατασκευἥς</span>.) For his hearers were not in a state of indifference. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> had aroused them all; they were even full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and amazement. Wherefore also there was no need of beginning at that point, but rather with a different topic; by which, in fact, he powerfully conciliated them, namely, by rejecting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> which was to be had from them. For nothing is so advantageous, and so likely to pacify the hearers, as to say nothing about one's self of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> nature, but, on the contrary, to obviate all surmise of wishing to do so. And, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, much more did they increase their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> by despising <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and showing that what had just taken place was no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human act</font></u></a>, but a Divine work; and that it was their part to join with the beholders in admiration, rather than to receive it from them. Do you see how clear of all ambition he is, and how he repels the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> paid to him? In the same manner also did the ancient fathers; for instance, Daniel said, <q>Not for any wisdom that is in me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/dan002.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Daniel 2:30</font></u></a></span> And again Joseph, <q>Do not interpretations belong to God?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen011.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 11:8</font></u></a></span> And David, <q>When the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210109.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lion</font></u></a> and the bear came, in the name of the Lord I rent them with my hands.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa017.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 17:34</font></u></a></span> And so likewise here the Apostles, <q>Why do you look so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> we had made this man to walk?</q> </p>

In the former address he appealed to the patriarch David, here he appeals to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a> and the rest. <q>Hath <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> His Servant Jesus.</q> Again a lowly expression, like as in the opening address.</p>
<p>But at this point he proceeds to enlarge upon the outrage, and exalts the heinousness of the deed, no longer, as before, throwing a veil over it. This he does, wishing to work upon them more powerfully. For the more he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> them accountable, the better his purpose were effected. <q>Hath <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>,</q> he says, <q>His Servant Jesus, Whom ye delivered up, and denied Him in the presence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a>, when he was determined to let him go.</q> The charge is twofold: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a> was desirous to let Him go; you would not, when he was willing. <q>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince (or Author) of Life: Whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</q> (v. 14-15.) You desired a robber instead of Him. He shows the great aggravation of the act. As he has them under his hand, he now strikes hard. <q>The Prince of Life,</q> he says. In these words he establishes the doctrine of the Resurrection. <q>Whom God has raised from the dead.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:26</font></u></a></span> <q>Whence does this appear?</q> He no longer refers to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210109.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Prophets</font></u></a>, but to himself, inasmuch as now he has a right to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. Before, when he affirmed that He was risen, he adduced the testimony of David; now, having said it, he alleges the College of Apostles. <q>Whereof we are witnesses,</q> he says.</p>
<p><q>And His name, through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>: yea, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> which is by Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</q> Seeking to declare the matter (<span>ζητὥν τὸ πρἅγμα εὶπεἵν</span>), he straightway brings forward the sign: <q>In the presence,</q> he says, <q>of you all.</q> As he had borne hard upon them, and had shown that He Whom they crucified had risen, again he relaxes, by giving them the power of repentance; <q>And now, brethren, I know that through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> you did it, as did also your rulers.</q></p>

The second is of a different kind. As Joseph speaks to his brethren, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> did send me before you <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen045.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 45:5</font></u></a></span>; what in the former speech he had briefly said, in the words, <q>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, you have taken,</q>— this he here enlarges upon: <q>But what God before had showed by the mouth of all His Prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He has so fulfilled.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:18</strong></font></u></a></span> At the same time showing, that it was not of their doing, if this be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>, that it took place after <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210109.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>'s counsel. He alludes to those words with which they had reviled Him on the Cross, namely <q>Let Him deliver Him, if He will have Him; for He said, I am the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>. If He trust in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, let Him now come down from the cross.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat027.htm#verse42" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 27:42-43</font></u></a></span> O foolish men, were these idle words? It must needs so come to pass, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> thereunto. Therefore if He descended not, it was for no weakness of His own that He did not come down, but for very power. And Peter puts this by way of apology for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, hoping that they may also close with what he says. <q>He has so fulfilled,</q> he says. Do you see now how he refers everything to that source? <q>Repent ye therefore,</q> he says, <q>and be converted.</q> He does not add, <q>from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>;</q> but, <q>that your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, may be blotted out,</q> means the same thing. And then he adds the gain: <q>So shall the times of refreshing come from the presence of the Lord.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:19</strong></font></u></a></span> This betokens them in a sad state, brought low by many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>. For it is to the case of one on fire, and craving comfort, that the expression applies. And see now how he advances. In his first sermon, he but slightly hinted at the resurrection, and Christ's sitting in heaven; but here he also speaks of His visible advent. And He shall send Jesus the Christ ordained (for you), <q>Whom the heaven must (<em>i.e.</em> must of necessity) receive, until the times of the restitution of all things.</q> The reason why He does not now come is clear. <q>Which God has spoken,</q> he continues, <q>by the mouth of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> since the world began. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like me; him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</q> Before, he had spoken of David, here he speaks of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>. <q>Of all things,</q> he says, <q>which He has spoken.</q> But he does not say, <q>which Christ,</q> but, <q>which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has spoken by the mouth of all His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> since the world began.</q> (v. 20-21.) Then he betakes him to the ground of credibility, saying, <q>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like me; Him shall you hear in all things.</q> And then the greatness of the punishment: <q>And it shall come to pass, that every <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, from Samuel and those that follow, after, as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days.</q> (v. 23-24.) He has done well to set the distinction here. For whenever he says anything great, he appeals to them of old. And he found a text which contained both truths; just as in the other discourse he said, <q>Until He put His foes under His feet.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:35</font></u></a></span> The remarkable circumstance is, that the two things stand together; that is, subjection and disobedience, and the punishment. <q>Like unto me,</q> he says. Then why are you alarmed? <q>You are the children of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a></q></p>

For as they deemed that through their outrage they had become alienated (and indeed there is no parity of reason, that He Who now is crucified, should now cherish them as His own), he proves to them that both the one and the other are in accordance with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>. <q>You are the children,</q> he says, <q>of the Prophets, and of the covenant which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> made with our fathers, saying unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, 'And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.'

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now let us consider again more minutely what has been read out. <strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> In the first place, he establishes the point that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracle</font></u></a> was performed by them ; saying, <q>Why marvel ye?</q> And he will not let the assertion be disbelieved: and to give it more weight, he anticipates their judgment. <q>Why look ye,</q> he says, <q>so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> we had made this man to walk?</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:12</strong></font></u></a></span> If this troubles and confounds you, learn Who was the Doer, and be not amazed. And observe how on all occasions when he refers to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and says that all things are from Him, then he fearlessly chides them: as above where he said, <q>A man approved of God among you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:22</font></u></a></span> And on all occasions he reminds them of the outrage they had committed, in order that the fact of the Resurrection may be established. But here he also subjoins something else; for he no more says, <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a>,</q> but what? <q>The God of our fathers has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a> His Servant Jesus.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:13</strong></font></u></a></span> Observe also the modesty. He reproached them not, neither did he say at once, <q>Believe then now: behold, a man that has been forty years lame, has been raised up through the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> This he did not say, for it would have excited opposition. On the contrary, he begins by commending them for admiring the deed, and again calls them after their ancestor: <q>You men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>.</q> Moreover, he does not say, It was Jesus that healed him: but, <q>The God of our fathers has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>,</q> etc. But then, lest they should say, How can this stand to reason— that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> should glorify the transgressor? Therefore he reminds them of the judgment before <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a>, showing that, would they but consider, He was no transgressor; else <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a> had not wished to release Him. And he does not say, <q>when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a> was desirous,</q> but, <q>was determined to let Him go.</q> <q>But ye denied the Holy One,</q> etc. (v. 13-14.) Him who had killed others, you asked to be released; Him Who quickens them that are killed, you did not wish to have! And that they might not ask again, How should it be that God now glorifies Him, when before He gave no assistance? He brings forward the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, testifying that so it behooved to be. <q>But those things which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> before had showed,</q> etc., <span><em>infra</em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act003.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 3:18</strong></font></u></a></span> Then, lest they should suppose that God's dispensation was their own apology, first he reproves them. Moreover, that the denying Him <q>to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate's</font></u></a> face,</q> was no ordinary thing; seeing that he wished to release Him. And that you cannot deny this, the man who was asked in preference to Him is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> against you. This also is part of a deep dispensation. Here it shows their shamelessness and effrontery; that a Gentile, one who saw Him for the first time, should have discharged Him, though he had heard nothing striking; while they who had been brought up among His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, have done the very opposite! For, as he has said, <q>When he (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a>) had determined to let Him go,</q> that it may not be imagined that he did this of favor, we read, And he said, It is a custom with you to release one prisoner: will you therefore that I release unto you this man? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat027.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 27:15</font></u></a></span> <q>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar015.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 15:6</font></u></a></span> He does not say, <q>You delivered up;</q> but everywhere, <q>You denied.</q> For, said they, <q>We have no king but Cæsar.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh019.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 19:15</font></u></a></span> And he does not say only, You did not beg off the innocent, and, <q>You denied</q> Him but, <q>You slew</q> Him. While they were hardened, he refrained from such language; but when their minds are most moved, then he strikes home, now that they are in a condition to feel it. For just as when men are drunk we say nothing to them, but when they are sober, and are recovered from their intoxication then we chide them; thus did Peter: when they were able to understand his words, then he also sharpened his tongue, alleging against them many charges; that, Whom God had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorified</font></u></a>, they had delivered up; Whom <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pilate</font></u></a> would have acquitted they denied to his face; that they preferred the robber before Him.</p>
<p>Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, <q>Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:24</font></u></a></span>, so here he says, <q>And killed the Prince of Life.</q></p>
<p><q></q> </p>

The prince (or author) of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> would be he that first brought forth <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>; the prince or author of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, he who first originated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>; so also the Prince (or Author) of Life must be He Who has Life from Himself. <q>Whom God raised up,</q> he continues: and now that he has uttered this, he adds, And his name, upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>; yea, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> which is by Him has given Him this perfect soundness. [The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> which is by Him <span>ἡ</span> <span>δι᾿ αὐτοὕ πίστις</span> .] And yet it was <span>ἡ</span> <span>εἰς αὐτὸν πιστις</span>, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> which is in Him</q> (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, <q>By the name,</q> but, <q>In the name,</q> and it was in Him (<span>εἰς αὐτὸν</span>) that the man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>.

For that Person needed not Another's help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man, being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own testimony. Thus above, he said, <q>As ye yourselves also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>;</q> and, <q>In the midst of you:</q> and here again, <q>Whom ye see and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>: in the presence of you all.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:22</font></u></a></span> And yet that it was, <q>In His name,</q> they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not: but they did <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the man was lame, that he stands there whole. They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the appellation of Brethren, <q>And now, brethren, I know, etc.</q> For in the former discourse he foretold nothing, but only says concerning Christ, <q>Therefore let all the house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> assuredly:</q> here he adds an admonition. There he waited till the people spoke: here, he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> how much they had already effected, and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. <q>That through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> you did it.</q> And yet the circumstances mentioned above were not to be put to the score of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>. To choose the robber, to reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to destroy Him— how should this be referred to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>? Nevertheless, he gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had happened. Now this indeed, that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">put to death</font></u></a> the innocent, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>: but that you were killing <q>the Prince of Life,</q> this, belike, you did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, <q>ye and your rulers:</q> for doubtless it would have roused their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer, when you accuse him of some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> that he has done, in his endeavor to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, <q>You crucified,</q> <q>You killed,</q> but, <q>You did it;</q> leading them to seek for pardon. If those rulers did it through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, much more did these present. <q>But these things which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> before had showed,</q> etc. </p>

The fact is, that each one of such passages is accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in store for them [as]; <q>I will deliver up,</q> says one, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> in requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa053.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 53:9</font></u></a></span> And again, * * * <q>Those things,</q> he says, <q>which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> before had showed by the mouth of all His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, that Christ should suffer, He has so fulfilled.</q> It shows the greatness of that <q>counsel,</q> in that <em>all</em> spoke of it, and not one only. It does not follow, because the event was through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, that it took place irrespectively of God's ordinance. See how great is the Wisdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, when it uses the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> of others to bring about that which must be. <q>He has fulfilled,</q> he says: that they may not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs suffer, has been fulfilled.

For, if He predicted many things and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. <q>Who was purposely designed,</q> says he: in Whom there is nothing novel.

For that they may not suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, he says, <q>To bless you.</q> For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the affair is a promise. <q>Unto you first.</q> That is, so far are you from having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For you are not to feel like castaways. <q>Having raised up</q>: again, the Resurrection. <q>In turning away,</q> he says, <q>every one of you from his iniquities.</q> In this way He blesses you: not in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the transgressor becomes immediately also blessed; he is simply released from his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. But this, <q>Like unto me,</q> would no wise apply. <q>Hear ye Him,</q> he says; and not this alone, but he adds, <q>And it shall come to pass, that every <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</q> When he has shown them that they had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>, and has imparted forgiveness to them, and promised <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, then indeed, then he says, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> also says the same thing.</q> What sort of connection is this: <q>Until the times of the restitution;</q> and then to introduce <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, saying, that all that Christ said shall come to pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so that for this reason also ye ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>): <q>You are the children of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> and of the covenant:</q> i.e. heirs.

True, you have done <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, <q>Unto you God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.</q> He says not, To save you, but what is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.</p>
<p>Let us then also imitate Him. Let us cast out that spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> and enmity. It is not enough not to retaliate (for even in the Old Dispensation this was exemplified); but let us do all as we would for bosom-friends, as we would for ourselves so for those who have injured us. We are followers of Him, we are His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, who after being crucified, sets everything in action in behalf of his murderers, and sends out His Apostles to this end.

Lop off the oaths of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, and you have clipt the wings of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, you have smothered all his passion. Swearing, it is said, is as the wind to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. Lower the sails; no need of sails, when there is no wind. If then we do not clamor, and do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, we have cut the sinews of passion. And if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> this, just put it to experiment. Impose it as a law upon the passionate man that he shall never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, and you will have no necessity of preaching moderation to him. So the whole business is finished. For even though you do not forswear yourselves [yet], by swearing at all, do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> in what absurd consequences you involve yourselves— binding yourselves to an absolute necessity and as with a cord, and putting yourselves to all manner of shifts, as men studying how to rescue their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> from an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> which there is no escaping, or, failing of that, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> [by that self-imposed necessity] to spend your life thenceforth in vexation, in quarrels, and to curse your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>? But all is in vain, and to no purpose. Threaten, be peremptory (<span>διόρισαι</span>), do all, whatever it be, without swearing; [so]: it is in your power to reverse (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ναλὕσαι</span>) both what you have said and what you have done if you have the mind. Thus on the present day I must needs speak more gently to you. For since you have heard me, and the greater part of the reformation is achieved by you, now then let us see for what purpose the taking of oaths was introduced, and why allowed to be. In relating to you their first origin, and when they were conceived, and how, and by whom we shall give you this account in requital for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>. For it is fit that he who has made his practice right, should be taught the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> of the matter, but he who is not yet doing the right, is not worthy to be told the history.</p>
<p>They made many covenants in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham's</font></u></a> time, and slew victims, and offered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a>, and as yet oaths were not. Whence then did they come in? When <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> increased, when all was confusion, upside down, when men had turned aside to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>: then it was, then, when men appeared no longer worthy to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, that they called God as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, as if thereby giving an adequate surety for what they said. Such in fact is the Oath: it is a security where men's principles cannot be trusted. So that in the indictment of the swearer the first charge is this—that he is not to be trusted without a surety, and a great surety too: for such is the exceeding faithlessness, that they ask not man as surety, but will needs have God! Secondly, the same charge lies against him who receives the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>: that, in a question of compact, he must drag in God for warranty, and refuse to be satisfied unless he get Him. O the excessive stupidity, the insolence of such conduct! Thou, a worm, earth and dust, and ashes, and vapor, to drag in your Lord as the surety, and to compel the other to drag Him in likewise! Tell me, if your servants were disputing with each other, and exchanging assurances with each other, and the fellow-servant should declare that for his part he would not be satisfied till he had their common master given him for surety, would he not have stripes given him without number, and be made to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the master is for other purposes, and not to be put to any such use as this? Why do I speak of a fellow-servant? For should he choose any respectable person, would not that person consider it an affront? But I do not wish to do this, say you. Well: then do not compel the other to do so either: since where men only are in question, this is done— if your party says, <q>I give such an one as my surety,</q> you do not allow him. <q>What then,</q> say you, <q>am I to lose what I have given?</q> I am not speaking of this; but that you allow him to insult God. For which reason greater shall be the inevitable punishment to him who forces the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> upon another, than to him who takes it: the same holds with regard to him who gives an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> when no one asks him. And what makes it worse, is, that every one is ready to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, for one farthing, for some petty item, for his own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>. All this may be said, when there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>; but if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a> follow in the train, both he that imposes and he that takes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> have turned everything upside down. <q>But there are some things,</q> you will say, <q>which are unknown.</q> Well take these into account, and do nothing negligently; but, if you do act negligently, take the loss to yourself as your punishment. It is better to be the loser thus, than in a very different way. For tell me— you force a man to take an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, with what expectation? That he will forswear himself? But this is utter insanity; and the judgment will fall upon your own head; better you should lose your money, than he be lost. Why act thus to your own detriment, and to the insulting of God? This is the spirit of a wild beast, and of an impious man. But you do this in the expectation that he will not forswear himself? Then trust him without the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>. <q>Nay, there are many,</q> you reply, <q>who in the absence of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> would presume to defraud; but, once the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> taken, would refrain.</q> You deceive yourself, man. A man having once learned to steal, and to wrong his neighbor, will presume full oft to trample upon his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>; if on the contrary he shrinks from swearing, he will much more shrink from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>. <q>But he is influenced against his will.</q> Well then, he deserves pardon.</p>
<p>But why am I speaking of this kind of oaths, while I pass over those in the market-place? For as regards these last, you can urge none of these pleas. For ten farthings you there have swearing and forswearing. In fact, because the thunderbolt does not actually fall from heaven, because all things are not overthrown, you stand holding God in your bonds: to get a few vegetables, a pair of shoes, for a little matter of money, calling Him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>. What is the meaning of this? Do not let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a>, that because we are not punished, therefore we do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; this comes of God's mercy; not of our merit. Let your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> be an imprecation upon your own child, upon your own self: say, <q>Else let the hangman lash my ribs.</q> But you dare not. Is God less valuable than your ribs? Is He less precious than your pate? Say <q>Else let me be struck blind.</q> But no. Christ so spares us, that He will not let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> even by our own head; and yet we so little spare the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, that on all occasions we must drag Him in! You <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not what God is, and with what sort of lips he behooves to be invoked. Why, when we speak of any man of eminent worth, we say, <q>First wash your mouth, and then make mention of him:</q> and yet, that precious Name which is above every name, the Name which is marvellous in all the earth, the Name which devils hear and tremble, we haul about as we list! Oh! The force of habit! Thereby has that Name become cheap. No <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, if you impose on any one the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10733a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">necessity</font></u></a> of coming into the sacred edifice to take his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> there, you feel that you have made the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> an awful one. And yet how is it that it seems awful in this way, but because we have been in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of using that at random, but not this? For ought not a shudder of awe to be felt when God is but named? But now, whereas among the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> His Name was held to be so reverend, that it was written upon plates, and none was allowed to wear the characters except the high-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> alone: we bandy about His Name like any ordinary word. If simply to name God was not allowed to all; to call Him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, what audacity is it! nay, what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a>! For if need were (rather than this) to fling away all that you have, ought you not readily to part with all? Behold, I solemnly declare and testify; reform these oaths of the forum, these superfluous oaths, and bring to me all those who wish to take them. Behold, in the presence of this assembly, I charge those who are set apart for the tending of the Houses of Prayer, I exhort and issue this order to them, that no person be allowed to take such oaths at his own discretion: or rather, that none be allowed to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> in any other way, but that the person be brought to me, whosoever he be, since even for these matters less will not serve but they must needs come before us, just as if one had to do with little children. May there be no occasion! It is a shame in some things still to need to be taught. Do you dare to touch the Holy Table, being a person unbaptized? No, but what is still worse, you the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> dare to lay your hand upon the Holy Table, which not even all ordained <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are allowed to touch, and so to take your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>. Now you would not go and lay your hand upon the head of your child, and yet do you touch the Table, and not shudder, not feel afraid? Bring these men to me; I will judge, and send them away rejoicing, both the one and the other. Do what you choose; I lay it down as a law that there be no swearing at all. What hope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, while we thus make all to have been done in vain? Is this the end of your bills, and your bonds, that you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? What gain do you get so great as the loss? Has he forsworn himself? You have undone both him and yourself. But has he not? Even so still you have undone (both), by forcing him to transgress the commandment. Let us cast out this disease from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>: at any rate let us drive it out of the forum, out of our shops, out of our other work-places; our profits will but be the greater. Do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that the success of your worldly plans is to be ensured by transgressions of the Divine <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>. <q>But he refuses to trust me,</q> say you; and in fact I have sometimes heard this said by some: <q>Unless I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> oaths without number, the man will not trust me.</q> Yes, and for this you may thank yourself, because you are so off-hand with your oaths. For were it not so, but on the contrary were it clear to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> that you do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, take my word for it, you would be more readily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> upon your mere nod, than those are who swallow oaths by thousands. For look now: which do you more readily <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>? Me who do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>, or those that do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>? <q>Yes,</q> say you, <q>but then you are ruler and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02581b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">bishop</font></u></a>.</q> Then suppose I prove to you that it is not only for that reason? Answer me with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, I beseech you; were I in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of perpetually swearing, would my office stand me in that stead? Not a whit. Do you see that it is not for this reason? And what do you gain at all? Answer me that. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> endured hunger; do you then also choose to hunger rather than to transgress one of the commandments of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Why are you so unbelieving? Here are you, ready to do and suffer all things for the sake of not swearing: and shall not He reward you? Shall He, Who sustains day by day both takers and breakers of oaths, give you over to hunger, when you have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> Him? Let all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> see, that of those who assemble in this Church not one is a swearer. By this also let us become manifest, and not by our creed alone; let us have this mark also to distinguish us both from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> and from all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>. Let us receive it as a seal from heaven, that we may everywhere be seen to be the King's own flock. By our mouth and tongue let us be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>, in the first place, just as the barbarians are by theirs: even as those who speak Greek are distinguished from barbarians, so let us be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a>. Answer me: the birds which are said to be parrots, how are they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to be parrots? Is it not by speaking like men? Let us then be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> by speaking like the Apostles; by speaking like the Angels. If any one bid you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a> tell him, <q>Christ has spoken, and I do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>.</q> This is enough to make a way for all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> to come in. It is a gate to religion, a high road leading to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>; a kind of training-school. These things let us observe, that we may obtain also the future blessings, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, to Whom with the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

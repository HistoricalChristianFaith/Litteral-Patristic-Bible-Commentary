<div><strong><font size="4">Acts 2:1-2</font></strong>
<p><q>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven.</q></p>
<p>Do you perceive the type? What is this Pentecost? The time when the sickle was to be put to the harvest, and the ingathering was made. See now the reality, when the time had come to put in the sickle of the word: for here, as the sickle, keen-edged, came the Spirit down. For hear the words of Christ: <q>Lift up your eyes,</q> He said, <q>and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh004.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 4:35</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>The harvest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> is great, but the laborers are few.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat009.htm#verse38" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 9:38</font></u></a></span> But as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> of this harvest, He himself took [our nature], and bore it up on high. Himself first put in the sickle. Therefore also He calls the Word the Seed. <q>When,</q> it says, <q>the day of Pentecost was fully come</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk008.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 8:5, 11</font></u></a></span>: that is, when at the Pentecost, while about it, in short. For it was essential that the present events likewise should take place during the feast, that those who had witnessed the crucifixion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, might also behold these. <q>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:2</strong></font></u></a></span> Why did this not come to pass without sensible <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210104.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tokens</font></u></a>? For this reason. If even when the fact was such, men said, <q>They are full of new wine,</q> what would they not have said, had it been otherwise? And it is not merely, <q>there came a sound,</q> but, <q>from heaven.</q> And the suddenness also startled them, and brought all together to the spot. <q>As of a rushing mighty wind:</q> this betokens the exceeding vehemence of the Spirit. <q>And it filled all the house:</q> insomuch that those present both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, and (Edd. <span>τούτους</span>) in this manner were shown to be worthy. Nor is this all; but what is more awful still, <q>And there appeared unto them,</q> it says, <q>cloven tongues like as of fire.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:3</strong></font></u></a></span> Observe how it is always, <q>like as;</q> and rightly: that you may have no gross sensible notions of the Spirit. Also, <q>as it were of a blast:</q> therefore it was not a wind. <q>Like as of fire.</q> For when the Spirit was to be made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to John, then it came upon the head of Christ as in the form of a dove: but now, when a whole multitude was to be converted, it is <q>like as of fire. And it sat upon each of them.</q> This means, that it remained and rested upon them. For the sitting is significant of settledness and continuance.</p>
<p>Was it upon the twelve that it came? Not so; but upon the hundred and twenty. For Peter would not have quoted to no purpose the testimony of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, saying, <q>And it shall come to pass in the last days, says the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Lord God</font></u></a>, I will pour out of My spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joe002.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Joel 2:28</font></u></a></span> <q>And they were all filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:4</strong></font></u></a></span> For, that the effect may not be to frighten only, therefore is it both <q>with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, and with fire. And began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:11</font></u></a></span> They receive no other sign, but this first; for it was new to them, and there was no need of any other sign. <q>And it sat upon each of them,</q> says the writer. Observe now, how there is no longer any occasion for that person to grieve, who was not elected as was Matthias, <q>And they were all filled,</q> he says; not merely received the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, but <q>were filled. And began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</q> It would not have been said, <em>All</em>, the Apostles also being there present, unless the rest also were partakers. For were it not so, having above made mention of the Apostles distinctively and by name, he would not now have put them all in one with the rest. For if, where it was only to be mentioned that they were present, he makes mention of the Apostles apart, much more would he have done so in the case here supposed. Observe, how when one is <em>continuing in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a></em>, when one is in charity, then it is that the Spirit draws near. It put them in mind also of another vision: for as fire did He appear also in the bush. As the Spirit gave them utterance, <span>ἀ</span> <span>ποφθέγγεσθαι</span> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 3:2</font></u></a></span> For the things spoken by them were <span>ἀ</span> <span>ποφθέγματα</span>, profound utterances. <q>And,</q> it says, <q>there were dwelling at Jerusalem <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, devout men.</q> </p>

For, it says, There were dwelling at Jerusalem <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.

The multitude <em>was confounded:</em> was all in commotion. They marvelled; <q>Because that every man heard them speak in his own language.

And, they were all amazed, and were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, saying one to another, What means this? Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</q> O the excessive folly! O the excessive malignity! Why it was not even the season for that; for it was Pentecost. For this was what made it worse: that when those were confessing— men that were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, that were Romans, that were proselytes, yea perhaps that had crucified Him— yet these, after so great signs, say, <q>They are full of new wine!</q></p>
<p>But let us look over what has been said from the beginning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4">(Recapitulation.)</font></strong> <q>And when the day of Pentecost,</q> etc. <q>It filled,</q> he says, <q>the house.</q> That wind <span>πνοὴ</span> was a very pool of water. This betokened the copiousness, as the fire did the vehemence. This nowhere happened in the case of the Prophets: for to uninebriated <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> such accesses are not attended with much disturbance; but <q>when they have well drunken,</q> then indeed it is as here, but with the Prophets it is otherwise. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 3:3</font></u></a></span> The roll of a book is given him, and Ezekiel ate what he was about to utter. <q>And it became in his mouth,</q> it is said, <q>as honey for sweetness.</q> (And again the hand of God touches the tongue of another Prophet; but here it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> Himself: <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer001.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 1:9</font></u></a></span> so equal is He in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> with the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>.) And again, on the other hand, Ezekiel calls it <q>Lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze002.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 2:10</font></u></a></span> To them it might well be in the form of a book; for they still needed similitudes. Those had to deal with only one nation, and with their own people; but these with the whole world, and with men whom they never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>. Also Elisha receives the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> through the medium of a mantle <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2ki013.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Kings 13</font></u></a></span>; another by oil, as David <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa016.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 16:13</font></u></a></span>; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> by fire, as we read of him at the bush. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 3:2</font></u></a></span> But in the present case it is not so; for the fire itself sat upon them. (But wherefore did the fire not appear so as to fill the house? Because they would have been terrified.) But the story shows, that it is the same here as there. For you are not to stop at this, that <q>there appeared unto them cloven tongues,</q> but note that they were <q>of fire.</q> Such a fire as this is able to kindle <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infinite</font></u></a> fuel. Also, it is well said, <em>Cloven</em>, for they were from one root; that you may learn, that it was an operation sent from the Comforter. </p>
<p>But observe how those men also were first shown to be worthy, and then received the Spirit as worthy. Thus, for instance, David: what he did among the sheepfolds, the same he did after his victory and trophy; that it might be shown how simple and absolute was his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>. Again, see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> despising royalty, and forsaking all, and after forty years taking the lead of the people <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 2:11</font></u></a></span>; and Samuel occupied there in the temple <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 3:3</font></u></a></span>; Elisha leaving all <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki019.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Kings 19:21</font></u></a></span>; Ezekiel again, made manifest by what happened thereafter. In this manner, you see, did these also leave all that they had. They learned also what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> infirmity is, by what they suffered; they learned that it was not in vain they had done these good works. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa009.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 9</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa011.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">11:6</font></u></a></span> Even Saul, having first obtained <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> that he was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>, thereafter received the Spirit. But in the same manner as here did none of them receive. Thus <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> was the greatest of the Prophets, yet he, when others were to receive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, himself suffered diminution. But here it is not so; but just as fire kindles as many flames as it will, so here the largeness of the Spirit was shown, in that each one received a fountain of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>; as indeed He Himself had foretold, that those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in Him, should have <q>a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh004.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 4:14</font></u></a></span> And good reason that it should be so. For they did not go forth to argue with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11788c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Pharaoh</font></u></a>, but to wrestle with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. But the wonder is this, that when sent they made no objections; they said not, they were <q>weak in voice, and of a slow tongue.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo004.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 4:10</font></u></a></span> For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> had taught them better. They said not, they were too young. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 1:6</font></u></a></span> Jeremiah had made them wise. And yet they had heard of many fearful things, and much greater than were theirs of old time; but they feared to object.— And because they were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a> of light, and ministers of things above [<q>Suddenly there came from heaven,</q> etc.] To them of old, no one <q>from heaven</q> appears, while they as yet follow after a vocation on earth; but now that Man has gone up on high, the Spirit also descends mightily from on high. <q>As it were a rushing mighty wind;</q> making it manifest by this, that nothing shall be able to withstand them, but they shall blow away all adversaries like a heap of dust. <q>And it filled all the house.</q> The house also was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">symbol</font></u></a> of the world. <q>And it sat upon each of them,</q> [etc.] and <q>the multitude came together, and were confounded.</q> Observe their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>; they pronounce no hasty judgment, but are perplexed: whereas those reckless ones pronounce at once, saying, <q>These men are full of new wine.</q> Now it was in order that they might have it in their power, in compliance with the Law, to appear thrice in the year in the Temple, that they dwelt there, these <q>devout men from all nations.</q> Observe here, the writer has no intention of flattering them. For he does not say that they pronounced any opinion: but what? <q>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded.</q> And well they might be; for they supposed the matter was now coming to an issue against them, on account of the outrage committed against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Conscience also agitated their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, the very blood being yet upon their hands, and every thing alarmed them. <q>Behold, are not all these which speak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galileans</font></u></a>?</q> For indeed this was confessed. [<q>And how hear we</q>] so much did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210104.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sound</font></u></a> alarm them. [<q>Every man in our own tongue,</q> etc.] for it found the greater part of the world assembled there. [<q>Parthians and Medes,</q> etc.] This nerved the Apostles: for, what it was to speak in the Parthian tongue, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not but now learned from what those said. Here is mention made of nations that were hostile to them, Cretans, Arabians, Egyptians, Persians: and that they would conquer them all was here made manifest. But as to their being in those countries, they were there in captivity, many of them: or else, the doctrines of the Law had become disseminated [among] the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> in those countries. So then the testimony comes from all quarters: from citizens, from foreigners, from proselytes. <q>We do hear them speak in our tongues the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wonderful works</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> For it was not only that they spoke (in their tongues), but the things they spoke were wonderful. Well then might they be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>: for never had the like occurred. Observe the ingenuousness of these men. They were amazed and were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, saying, <q>What means this?</q> But <q>others mocking said, 'These men are full of new wine'</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh008.htm#verse48" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 8:48</font></u></a></span>, and therefore mocked. O the effrontery! And what wonder is it? Since even of the Lord Himself, when casting out devils, they said that He had a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>! For so it is; wherever impudent assurance exists, it has but one object in view, to speak at all hazards, it cares not what; not that the man should say something real and relevant to the matter of discourse, but that he should speak no matter what. [<q>They are full of new wine.</q>] Quite a thing of course (is not it?), that men in the midst of such dangers, and dreading the worst, and in such despondency, have the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a> to utter such things! And observe: since this was unlikely; because they would not have been drinking much [at that early hour], they ascribe the whole matter to the quality (of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210104.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wine</font></u></a>), and say, <q>They are full</q> of it. <q>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them.</q> In a former place you saw his provident forethought, here you see his manly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">courage</font></u></a>. For if they were astonished and amazed, was it not as wonderful that he should be able in the midst of such a multitude to find language, he, an unlettered and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> man? If a man is troubled when he speaks among friends, much more might he be troubled among enemies and bloodthirsty men. That they are not drunken, he shows immediately by his very voice, that they are not beside themselves, as the soothsayers: and this too, that they were not constrained by some compulsory force. What is meant by, <q>with the eleven?</q> They expressed themselves through one common voice, and he was the mouth of all. The eleven stood by as witnesses to what he said. <q>He lifted up his voice,</q> it is said. That is, he spoke with great confidence, that they might perceive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of the Spirit. He who had not endured the questioning of a poor girl, now in the midst of the people, all breathing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, discourses with such confidence, that this very thing becomes an unquestionable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of the Resurrection: in the midst of men who could deride and make a joke of such things as these! What effrontery, think you, must go to that! What impiety, what shamelessness! For wherever the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> is present, He makes men of gold out of men of clay. Look, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, at Peter now: examine well that timid one, and devoid of understanding; as Christ said, <q>Are ye also yet without understanding?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat015.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 15:16</font></u></a></span> the man, who after that marvellous confession was called <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Satan</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat016.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 16:23</font></u></a></span> Consider also the unanimity of the Apostles. They themselves ceded to him the office of speaking; for it was not necessary that all should speak. <q>And he lifted up his voice,</q> and spoke out to them with great boldness. Such a thing it is to be a spiritual man! Only let us also bring ourselves into a state meet for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> from above, and all becomes easy. For as a man of fire falling into the midst of straw would take no harm, but do it to others: not he could take any harm, but they, in assailing him, destroy themselves. For the case here was just as if one carrying hay should attack one bearing fire: even so did the Apostles encounter these their adversaries with great boldness.</p>
<p>For what did it harm them, though they were so great a multitude? Did they not spend all their rage? Did they not turn the distress upon themselves? Of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> were ever any so possessed with both rage and terror, as those became possessed? Were they not in an agony, and were dismayed, and trembled? For hear what they say, <q>Do ye wish to bring this man's blood upon us?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 5:28</font></u></a></span> Did they (the Apostles) not fight against poverty and hunger: against ignominy and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08001a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">infamy</font></u></a> (for they were accounted deceivers): did they not fight against ridicule and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> and mockery?— for in their case the contraries met: some laughed at them, others punished them—were they not made a mark for the wrathful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, and for the merriment, of whole cities? Exposed to factions and conspiracies: to fire, and sword, and wild beasts? Did not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> beset them from every quarter, in ten thousand forms? And were they any more affected in their minds by all these things, than they would have been at seeing them in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05154a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">dream</font></u></a> or in a picture? With bare body they took the field against all the armed, though against them all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> had arbitrary power [against them, were]: terrors of rulers, force of arms, in cities and strong walls: without experience, without skill of the tongue, and in the condition of quite ordinary men, matched against juggling conjurors, against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">impostors</font></u></a>, against the whole throng of sophists, of rhetoricians, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a> grown mouldy in the Academy and the walks of the Peripatetics, against all these they fought the battle out. And the man whose occupation had been about lakes, so mastered them, as if it cost him not so much ado as even a contest with dumb fishes: for just as if the opponents he had to outwit were indeed more mute than fishes, so easily did he get the better of them! And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a>, that talked a deal of nonsense in his day, is silent now, while this man utters his voice everywhere; not among his own countrymen alone, but also among Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and in India, and in every part of the earth, and to the extremities of the world. Where now is Greece, with her big pretentions? Where the name of Athens? Where the ravings of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a>? He of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galilee</font></u></a>, he of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02536a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Bethsaida</font></u></a>, he, the uncouth rustic, has overcome them all. Are you not ashamed— confess it— at the very name of the country of him who has defeated you? But if you hear his own name too, and learn that he was called Cephas, much more will you hide your faces. This, this has undone you quite; because you esteem this a reproach, and account glibness of tongue a praise, and want of glibness a disgrace. You have not followed the road you ought to have chosen, but leaving the royal road, so easy, so smooth, you have trodden one rough, and steep, and laborious. And therefore you have not attained unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08646a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kingdom of heaven</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Why then, it is asked, did not Christ exercise His influence upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a>, and upon Pythagoras? Because the mind of Peter was much more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophical</font></u></a> than their minds. They were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> children shifted about on all sides by vain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; but this man was a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a>, one apt to receive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. If you laugh at these words, it is no wonder; for those aforetime laughed, and said, the men were full of new wine. But afterwards, when they suffered those bitter calamities, exceeding all others in misery; when they saw their city falling in ruins, and the fire blazing, and the walls hurled to the ground, and those manifold frantic horrors, which no one can find words to express, they did not laugh then. And you will laugh then, if you have the mind to laugh, when the time of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> is close at hand, when the fire is kindled for your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. But why do I speak of the future? Shall I show you what Peter is, and what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a>? Let us for the present examine their respective habits, let us see what were the pursuits of each. The one wasted his time about a set of idle and useless <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05089a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">dogmas</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophical</font></u></a>, as he says, that we may learn that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a> becomes a fly. Most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> said, a fly! not indeed changed into one, but a fly must have entered upon possession of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> which dwelt in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a>; for what but a fly is worthy of such ideas! The man was full of irony, and of jealous feelings against every one else, as if he made it his ambition to introduce nothing useful, either out of his own head or other people's. Thus he adopted the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10234d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">metempsychosis</font></u></a> from another, and from himself produced the Republic, in which he enacted those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> full of gross turpitude. Let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, he says, be in common, and let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virgins</font></u></a> go naked, and let them wrestle before the eyes of their lovers, and let there also be common fathers, and let the children begotten be common. But with us, not nature makes common fathers, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a> of Peter does this; as for that other, it made away with all paternity. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato's</font></u></a> system only tended to make the real father next to unknown, while the false one was introduced. It plunged the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> into a kind of intoxication and filthy wallowing. Let all, he says, have intercourse with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. The reason why I do not examine the maxims of poets, is, that I may not be charged with ripping up fables. And yet I am speaking of fables much more ridiculous than even those. Where have the poets devised anything so portentous as this? But (not to enter into the discussion of his other maxims), what say you to these— when he equips the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">females</font></u></a> with arms, and helmets, and greaves, and says that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human race</font></u></a> has no occasion to differ from the canine! Since dogs, he says, the female and the male, do just the same things in common, so let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> do the same works as the men, and let all be turned upside down. For the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> has always endeavored by their means to show that our race is not more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than that of brutes; and, in fact, some have gone to such a pitch of (<span>κενοδοξίας</span>) absurdity, as to affirm that the irrational creatures are endued with reason. And see in how many various ways he has run riot in the minds of those men! For whereas their leading men affirmed that our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> passes into flies, and dogs, and brute creatures; those who came after them, being ashamed of this, fell into another kind of turpitude, and invested the brute creatures with all rational science, and made out that the creatures— which were called into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a> on our account— are in all respects more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> than we! They even attribute to them foreknowledge and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. The crow, they say, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and the raven likewise, and they possess gifts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, and foretell the future; there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justice</font></u></a> among them, and polity, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>. Perhaps you do not credit the things I am telling you. And well may you not, nurtured as you have been with sound doctrine; since also, if a man were fed with this fare, he would never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that there exists a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> being who finds pleasure in eating dung. The dog also among them is jealous, according to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Plato</font></u></a>. But when we tell them that these things are fables, and are full of absurdity, 'You do not enter (<span>ἐ</span> <span>νοήσατε</span>) into the higher meaning,' say they. No, we do not enter into this your surpassing nonsense, and may we never do so: for it requires (of course! ) an excessively profound <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, to inform me, what all this impiety and confusion would be at. Are you talking, senseless men, in the language of crows, as the children are wont (in play)? For you are in very deed children, even as they. But Peter never thought of saying any of these things: he uttered a voice, like a great light shining out in the dark, a voice which scattered the mist and darkness of the whole world. Again, his deportment, how gentle it was, how considerate (<span>ἐ</span> <span>πιεικὲς</span>); how far above all vainglory; how he looked towards heaven without all self-elation, and this, even when raising up the dead! But if it had come to be in the power of any one of those senseless people (in mere fantasy of course) to do anything like it, would he not straightway have looked for an altar and a temple to be reared to him, and have wanted to be equal with the gods? Since in fact when no such sign is forthcoming, they are forever indulging such fantastic conceits. And what, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, is that Minerva of theirs, and Apollo, and Juno? They are different kinds of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04710a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">demons</font></u></a> among them. And there is a king of theirs, who thinks fit to die for the mere purpose of being accounted equal with the gods. But not so the men here: no, just the contrary.

Here he directs his discourse to those others, the mockers, and while he seems to reason with those, he sets these right. For indeed it was divinely ordered that <q>some mocked,</q> that he might have a starting-point for his defence, and by means of that defence, might teach. [<q>And all you that dwell in Jerusalem.</q>] It seems they accounted it a high encomium to dwell in Jerusalem too. <q>Be this,</q> says he, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you, and hearken unto my words.</q> In the first instance he made them more disposed to attend to him. <q>For not as you suppose,</q> says he, <q>are these drunken.</q> Do you observe the mildness of his defence?<strong><font size="4"> </font></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:15</font></u></a></span> </font></strong>Although having the greater part of the people on his side, he reasons with those others gently; first he removes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> surmise, and then he establishes his apology. On this account, therefore, he does not say, <q>as you mock,</q> or, <q>as you deride,</q> but, <q>as you suppose;</q> wishing to make it appear that they had not said this in earnest, and for the present taxing them with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> rather than with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a>. <q>For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14514c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">third hour</font></u></a> of the day.</q> And why this? Is it not possible at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14514c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">third hour</font></u></a> to be drunken? But he did not insist upon this to the letter; for there was nothing of the kind about them; the others said it only in mockery. Hence we learn that on unessential points one must not spend many words. And besides, the sequel is enough to bear him out on this point: so now the discourse is for all in common. But this is that which was spoken by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> Joel, And it shall come to pass in the last days, says the Lord <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210105.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. (v. 16, 17. Joel 2:28.) Nowhere as yet the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, nor His promises but the promise is that of the Father. Observe the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210105.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wisdom</font></u></a>: observe the considerate forbearance: (<span>συγκατάβασιν</span>.) He did not pass on to speak at once of the things relating to Christ; that He had promised this after His Crucifixion; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> that would have been to upset all. And yet, you will say, here was sufficient to prove His divinity. True, it was, if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> (and the very point was that it should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>); but if not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, it would have caused them to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>. <q>And I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh.</q> He offers even to them excellent hopes, if they would have them. And so far, he does not leave it to be regarded as the exclusive advantage of himself and his company; which would have made them be looked upon with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210105.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eye</font></u></a>; thus cutting off all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envious</font></u></a> feeling. <q>And your sons shall prophesy.</q> And yet, he says, not yours this achievement, this distinction; the gift has passed over to your children. Himself and his company he calls their sons, and those [whom he is addressing] he calls his and their fathers. <q>And your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; and on My servants and on My handmaidens I will pour out in those days of My Spirit; and they shall prophesy.</q> So far he shows that he and his have found favor, in that they had received (<span>καταξιωθέντας</span>) [the Spirit]; not so they whom he is addressing; for that they had crucified [the Lord]. So Christ also, willing to mitigate their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, said, <q>By whom do your sons cast out devils?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat012.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 12:27</font></u></a></span> He did not say, My <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>; for indeed it seemed a flattering mode of expression. And so Peter also did not say, 'They are not drunk, but speak by the Spirit.' but he takes refuge with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, and under shelter of him, so speaks. As for the accusation [of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>], he cleared himself of that by his own assertion; but for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, he fetches the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>. <q>I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh.</q> [<q>And your sons,</q> etc.] To some the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> was imparted through dreams, to others it was openly poured forth. For indeed by dreams the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a> saw, and received revelations.</p>
<p>Then he goes on with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, which has in it also something terrible. <q>And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs</q> [<q>in the earth beneath</q>]. </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:19</strong></font></u></a></span> In these words he speaks both of the judgment to come, and of the taking of Jerusalem. <q>Blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.</q> Observe how he describes the capture. <q>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood.</q> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:20</strong></font></u></a></span> This results from the (<span>διαθέσεως</span>) internal affection of the sufferers. It is said, indeed, that many such phenomena actually did occur in the sky, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08522a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Josephus</font></u></a> attests. At the same time the Apostle strikes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> into them, by reminding them of the darkness which had lately occurred, and leading them to expect things to come. <q>Before that great and notable day of the Lord come.</q> For be not confident, he means to say, because at present you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> with impunity. For these things are the prelude of a certain great and dreadful day. Do you see how he made their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> to quake and melt within them, and turned their laughter into pleading for acquittal? For if these things are the prelude of that day, it follows that the extreme of danger is impending. But what next? He again lets them take breath, adding, <q>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:13</font></u></a></span> This is said concerning Christ, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> affirms, but Peter does not venture as yet to reveal this.</p>
<p>Well, let us look over again what has been said. It is well managed, that as against <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210105.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> laughing and mocking, he starts up and begins with, <q>Be this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto you all and hearken unto my words.</q> But he begins by saying, <q>You men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>.</q> By the expression <span>᾿</span> <span>Ιουδαἵοι</span>, I take him to mean those that lived in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>.— And, if you please, let us compare those expressions in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, that you may learn what a sudden change has taken place in Peter. <q>A damsel,</q> it is written, <q>came out unto him, saying, Thou also wast with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus of Nazareth</font></u></a>.</q> And, says he, <q>I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not the Man.</q> And being again questioned, <q>he began to curse and to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">swear</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat026.htm#verse69" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 26:69-72</font></u></a></span> But see here his boldness, and his great freedom of speech.— He did not praise those who had said, <q>We do hear them speak in our tongues the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wonderful works</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>;</q> but by his severity towards those others, he made these more earnest, and at the same time his address is clear from all appearance of adulation. And it is well to remark, on all occasions, however the Apostles may condescend to the level of their hearers (<span>συγκατάβασις</span>), their language is clear from all appearance both of adulation and of insolence: which is a difficult point to manage.</p>
<p>Now that these things should have occurred at <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14514c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">third hour</font></u></a>,</q> was not without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>. For the brightness of this fire is shown at the very time when people are not engaged in their works, nor at dinner; when it is bright day, when all are in the market-place. Do you observe also the freedom which fills his speech? <q>And hearken to my words.</q> And he added nothing, but, <q>This,</q> says he, <q>is that which was spoken by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days.</q> He shows, in fact, that the consummation is near at hand, and the words, <q>In the last days,</q> have a kind of emphasis. [<q>I will pour out,</q> etc.] And then, that he may not seem to limit the privilege to the sons only, he subjoins, <q>And your old men shall dream dreams.</q> Mark the sequence. First sons; just as David said, <q>Instead of your fathers, were begotten your sons.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa044.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 45:17</font></u></a></span> And again Malachi; <q>They shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. And on my handmaidens, and on my servants.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mal004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Malachi 4:6</font></u></a></span> This also is a token of excellence, for we have become His servants, by being freed from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. And great is the gift, since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> passes over to the other sex also, not as of old, it was limited to just one or two individuals, as Deborah and Huldah. He did not say that it was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, neither did he expound the words of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>; but he merely brings in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> to fight its own battle. As yet also he has said nothing about Judas; and yet it was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to all what a doom and punishment he had undergone; for nothing was more forcible than to argue with them from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>: this was more forcible even than facts. For when Christ performed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, they often contradicted Him. But when Christ brought forward the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, saying, <q>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand,</q> they were silent, and <q>no man,</q> we read, <q>was able to answer Him a word.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa089.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 90:1</font></u></a></span> And on all occasions He Himself also appealed to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>; for instance, <q>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh010.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 10:35</font></u></a></span> And in many places one may find this. On this account here also Peter says, <q>I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh;</q> that is, upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> also. But he does not yet reveal this, nor give interpretations; indeed, it was better not to do so (as also this obscure saying, <q>I will show wonders in heaven above,</q> put them the more in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> because it was obscure.) And it would have been more an offense, had it been interpreted from the very first. Then besides, even as plain, he passes over it, wishing to make them regard it as such. But after all, he does interpret to them anon, when he discourses to them upon the resurrection, and after he has paved the way by his discourse. (<em>infra</em> v. 39.) For since the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things were not sufficient to allure them, [it is added, <q>And I will show wonders, etc.</q>]. Yet this has never been fulfilled. For none escaped then [in that former judgment], but now the faithful did escape, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15379a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Vespasian's</font></u></a> time. And this it is that the Lord speaks of, <q>Except those days had been shortened, not all flesh should be saved.</q>— [<q>Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</q>] <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:22</font></u></a></span> The worst to come first; namely, the inhabitants to be taken, and then the city to be razed and burnt. Then he dwelt upon the metaphor, bringing before the eyes of the hearers the overthrow and the taking. <q>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood.</q> What means, the moon turned into blood? It denotes the excess of the slaughter. The language is fraught with helpless dismay. (<em>supra</em> p. 32.) <q>And it shall come to pass, every one who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Every one,</q> he says: though he be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12406a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">priest</font></u></a> (but he does not vet reveal the meaning), though bond, though free. For there is no male nor female in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>, no bond, no free. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal003.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 3:28</font></u></a></span> Well may it be so, for all these are but shadow. For if in king's palaces there is no high-born nor low-born, but each appears according to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>; and in art, each is shown by his works; much more in that school of wisdom (<span>φιλοσοφια</span>). <q>Every one who shall invoke.</q> Invoke: not any how, for it is written, <q>Not every one that says unto Me, Lord, Lord:</q> but with (<span>διαθέσεως</span>) inward earnest affection, with a life more than commonly good, with the confidence which is meet. Thus far, however, he makes the discourse light, by introducing that which relates to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>, and that terrible which relates to the punishment. For in the invocation is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>What, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, is this you say? Do you talk of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> for them after the Cross? Bear with me a little. Great is the mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And this very fact does, no less than the resurrection, prove him to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, yea, no less than His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>— the fact that He calls these to Him. For surpassing goodness is, above all things, peculiarly God's own. Therefore also He says, <q>None is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> save one, that is, God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk018.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 18:19</font></u></a></span> Only let us not take this goodness for an occasion of negligence. For He also punishes as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. In fact, the very punishments here spoken of, He brought them to pass, even He who said, <q>Every one who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</q> I speak of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a> of Jerusalem; that intolerable punishment: of which I will tell you some few of the particulars, useful to us in our contest, both with the Marcionites and many other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>. For, since they distinguish between Christ a good <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> God [of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>], let us see who it was that effected these things. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, taking vengeance for Christ? Or not so? How then alien to Him? But was it the good God? Nay, but it is demonstrated that both the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a> did these things. The Father in many places; for instance, when He says in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the vineyard, [<q>He will miserably destroy those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> husbandmen</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat021.htm#verse41" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 21:41</font></u></a></span>; again in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a> of the marriage feast, the King is said] to send His armies <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:7</font></u></a></span>: and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, when He says, <q>But those Mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk019.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 19:27</font></u></a></span> * * *. And they sent, saying, We will not have You to reign over us. Would you like then to hear the things which actually came to pass? Moreover, Christ Himself also speaks of the future tribulations, than which never any thing more dreadful came to pass; never any thing more ruthless, my beloved, than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> then done! And He Himself declared it. For what could you wish to see more grievous than these? * * *— probed them with their daggers! — * * * But shall I relate to you the shocking case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, that tragic tale? * * * (Joseph. B. J. vi. 3. 4.) Did not the actual events cast all misery into the shade? But shall I tell you of famines and pestilences? One might speak of horrors without number: nature was unknown; law unknown; they outdid wild beasts in ferocity. True, these miseries came by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05793a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fate</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>; but because <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, because Christ so willed it to be. These facts will apply both against the Marcionites and against those who do not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> that there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>: for they are sufficient to silence their impudence. Are not these calamities more severe than the Babylonian? Are not these sufferings more grievous than the famines of that time? Yes, for [<q>never was the like from the beginning of the world</q>] <q>no, nor ever shall be such.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat024.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 24:21</font></u></a></span> And this was Christ's own declaration. In what sense then, think ye, is it said that Christ remitted them their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>? Perhaps it seems a commonplace question: but do ye solve it.— It is not possible to show anywhere, even in fiction, any thing like what the reality was here. And had it been a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> that wrote this history, the matter might be regarded with suspicion: but if he was a Jew, and a Jewish zealot, and after the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a>, how can the meaning of the facts be otherwise than palpable to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>? For you will see the man, how, everywhere, he always extols the concerns of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>.— There is therefore a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, O man! And God is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>.— Aye, did you shudder at hearing these horrors? But these, which take place here, are nothing in comparison with what shall be in that world. Once more I am compelled to seem harsh, disagreeable, stern. But what can I do? I am set to this: just as a severe schoolmaster is set to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> by his scholars: so are we. For would it not be strange indeed, that, while those who have a certain post assigned them by kings do that which is appointed them, however disagreeable the task may be, we, for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of your censure, should leave our appointed task undone? Another has a different work. Of you, many have it for their work, to show mercy, to act humanely, to be pleasant and agreeable to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> to whom you are benefactors. But to those to whom we do good, we seem stern and severe, troublesome and disagreeable. For we do good, not by the pleasure we give, but by the pain we inflict. So it is also with the physician: though he indeed is not excessively disagreeable, for the benefit afforded by his art is had immediately; ours hereafter. So again the magistrate is odious to the disorderly and seditious; so the legislator is vexatious to them for whom he makes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>. But not so he that invites to enjoyment, not so he that prepares public festivities and entertainments, and puts all the people in garlands: no, these are men that win acceptance, feasting, as they do, whole cities with all sorts of spectacles; contributing largely, bearing all the cost. And therefore those whom they have treated, requite them for these enjoyments with words of welcome and benediction, with hanging (<span>παραπετάσματα</span>) of tapestries, and a blaze of lamps, and with wreaths, and boughs, and brilliant garments. Whereas, at the sight of the physician, the sick become sad and downcast: at sight of the magistrate, the rioters become subdued: no running riot then, no gambolling, except when he also goes over into their ranks. Let us see, then, which render the best service to their cities; those who provide these festivities, and banquetings, and expensive entertainments, and manifold rejoicings; or those who restrain all those doings, bearing before them stocks, scourges, executioners, dreaded soldiers, and a voice fraught with much terror: and issuing orders, and making men hang down their heads, and with the rod dispersing the idlers in the market-place. Let us see, I say; these are the disagreeable, those the beloved: let us see where the gain rests. (<span>λήλει</span>.) What comes then of your pleasure-givers? A kind of frigid enjoyment, lasting till the evening, and tomorrow vanished; mirth ungoverned, words unseemly and dissolute. And what of these? Awe, sobriety, subdued thoughts; reasonableness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, an end of idleness; a curb on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> within; a wall of defence, next to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, against assailants from without. It is by means of these we have each our property but by those ruinous festivities we dissipate it. Robbers indeed have not invaded it, but vainglory together with pleasure acts the part of robber. Each sees the robber carrying off everything before his eyes, and is delighted at it! A new fashion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a>, this, to induce people to be glad when one is plundering them! On the other part, there is nothing of the kind: but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as the common Father, has secured us as by a wall against all [depredators], both seen and unseen. For, <q>Take heed,</q> says He, <q>that you do not your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01328f.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">alms</font></u></a> before men.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:1</font></u></a></span> The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> learns from the one, [excess; from the other] to flee <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a>. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injustice</font></u></a> consists not merely in grasping at more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> than belongs to us, but in giving to the belly more than its needful sustenance, in carrying mirth beyond its proper bounds, and causing it to run into frantic excesses. From the one, it learns sobriety; from the other, unchastity. For it is unchastity, not merely to have carnal intercourse with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>, but even to look upon a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> with unchaste eyes. From the one, it learns modesty; from the other, conceited self-importance. For, <q>All things,</q> says the Apostle, <q>are lawful for me, but not all things expedient.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:12</font></u></a></span> From the one, decent behavior; from the other unseemliness. For, as to the doings in the theatres, I pass these. But to let you see that it is not even a pleasure either, but a grief, show me, but a single day after the festival, both those who spent their money in giving it, and those who were feasted with spectacles: and you shall see them all looking dejected enough, but most of all him, your (<span>ἔ</span> <span>κεἵνον</span>) famous man that has spent his money for it. And this is but fair: for, the day before, he delighted the common man, and the common man indeed was in high good humor and enjoyment, and rejoiced indeed in the splendid garment, but then not having the use of it, and seeing himself stripped of it, he was grieved and annoyed; and wanted to be the great man, seeing even his own enjoyment to be small compared with his. Therefore, the day after, they change places, and now he, the great man, gets the larger share in the dejection.</p>
<p>Now if in worldly matters, amusements are attended with such dissatisfaction, while disagreeable things are so beneficial, much more does this hold in things spiritual. Why is it that no one quarrels with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, but on the contrary all account that matter a common benefit? For indeed not strangers from some other quarter, nor enemies of those for whom the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are made, came and made these orders, but the citizens themselves, their patrons, their benefactors: and this very thing, the making of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, is a token of beneficence and good-will. And yet the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are full of punishment and restraint, and there is no such thing as law without penalty and coercion. Then is it not unreasonable, that while the expositors of those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are called deliverers, benefactors, and patrons, we are considered troublesome and vexatious if we speak of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of God? When we discourse about <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, then we bring forward those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>: just as in the affairs of the world, people urge the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, highway <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a>, and the like, so do we the penal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, which not man enacted, but the Only-Begotten <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a> Himself. Let him that has no mercy, He says, be punished <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat018.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 18:23</font></u></a></span>; for such is the import of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parable</font></u></a>. Let him that remembers injuries, pay the last penalty. Let him that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> without <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, be cast into the fire. Let him that reviles, receive his due in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. If you think these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> which you hear strange, be not amazed. For if Christ was not intended to make new <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, why did He come? Those other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> are manifest to us; we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that the murderer and adulterer ought to be punished. If then we were meant only to be told the same things over again, where was the need of a heavenly Teacher? Therefore He does not say, Let the adulterer be punished, but, whoso looks on with unchaste eyes. And where, and when, the man will receive punishment, He there tells us. And not in fine public monuments, nor yet somewhere out of sight, did He deposit His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>; not pillars of brass did He raise up, and engrave letters thereon, but twelve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> raised He up for us, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of the Apostles, and in their minds has He by the Spirit inscribed this writing. This cite we to you. If this was authorized to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, that none might take refuge in the plea of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, much more is it to us. But should any say, <q>I do not hear, therefore have no guilt,</q> on this very score he is most liable to punishment. For, were there no teacher, it would be possible to take refuge in this plea; but if there be, it is no longer possible. Thus see how, speaking of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, the Lord deprives them of all excuse; <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>:</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh015.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 15:22</font></u></a></span>: and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> again, <q>But I say, have they not heard? Nay, but into all the earth went forth their sound.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom010.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 10:18</font></u></a></span> For then there is excuse, when there is none to tell the man; but when the watchman sits there, having this as the business of his life, there is excuse no longer. Nay, rather, it was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, not that we should look only upon these written pillars, but that we should ourselves be such. But since we have made ourselves unworthy of the writing, at least let us look to those.

<p>[<q>He men of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a></q>]: it is not for flattery that he uses this term; but, as he has borne hard upon them, he relaxes a little, and puts them in mind of their great ancestor [<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>]. Here again he begins with an introduction, that they may not become excited, now that he is going to make express mention to them of Jesus: for in what preceded, there was no reason why they should be excited, while the Prophet was the subject of discourse: but the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> would have given offense at the very outset.— And he does not say, <q>Do as I bid you,</q> but, <em>Hear;</em> as being not at all exacting. And observe how he forbears to speak of the high <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210106.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">matters</font></u></a>, and begins with the very low: <q>Jesus,</q> he says: and then straightway mentions the place He belonged to, being one which was held in mean estimation: <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus of Nazareth</font></u></a></q>: and does not say anything great about Him, nor even such as one would say about a Prophet, so far: <q>Jesus,</q> he says, <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10725a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nazareth</font></u></a>, a man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> (to be) from God among you.</q> Observe; what great matter was this, to say that He was sent from God?

And yet he does not all at once say, He is risen; but what?— <q>He came,</q> says he, <q>from God: this is manifest by the signs which</q>— he does not yet say, Jesus Himself wrought: but what?— <q>which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> wrought by Him in the midst of you.</q> He calls themselves as witnesses. <q>A man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> (to be sent) from God among you, by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and wonders and signs, which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> wrought by him in the midst of you, as also ye yourselves <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>.</q> Then, having fallen upon the mention of that their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrilegious</font></u></a> outrage, observe how he endeavors to quit them of the crime: <q>Him,</q> he says, <q>being by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God delivered up</q>:</p>

He has transferred the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> entire upon the head of Judas, now already parted from them; for he it was that delivered Him over to them by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kiss</font></u></a>. Or, <q>By <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> hands,</q> refers to the soldiers: for neither is it simply, <q>You have slain,</q> but, By <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210106.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> you have done this.

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 2:24</font></u></a></span>, says he. This was the great thing; and observe how he sets it in the middle of his discourse: for the former matters had been confessed; both the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> and the signs and the slaying— <q>Whom <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be kept in its power.</q> It is something great and sublime that he has hinted at here. For the expression, <q>It was not possible,</q> even itself is that of one assigning something. It shows that death itself in holding Him had pangs as in travail, and was sore bestead: whereas, by <em>pains</em>, or, travail-pangs, <em>of death</em>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a> means danger and disaster: and that He so rose as never more to die. For the assertion, <q>Seeing that it was not possible that He should be holden of it,</q> means this, that <em>His</em> rising was not common to the rest. Then, however, before their thoughts can enter at all into his meaning, he brings David upon them, an authority which sets aside all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> reasoning. <q>For David says (with reference) to Him.</q> </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:29</strong></font></u></a></span> When he is about to say anything great, he uses this opening address, to rouse and to conciliate them. <q>Let me be allowed,</q> he says, <q>to speak freely to you of the patriarch David.</q> Remarkable lowliness, in a case where he was giving no hurt, nor was there any reason why the hearers should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>. For he did not say, This is not said concerning David, but concerning the Christ. But in another point of view: by his reverential expression towards the blessed David, he awed them; speaking of an acknowledged fact as if it were a bold thing to say, and therefore begging them to pardon him for saying it. And thereupon his expression is not simply <q>concerning David,</q> but <q>concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried:</q> he does not also say, <q>and is not risen again,</q> but in another way (though this too would have been no great thing to say), <q>And his sepulchre is with us unto this day,</q> he has said what comes to the same thing. Then— and even so he does not come to the mention of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, but what next?— he goes on with his encomium upon David, <q>Being therefore a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> God had <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sworn</font></u></a> unto him.</q></p>

For now that he has soothed them with his expression, he confidently adds this: The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophet</font></u></a> [says it] <q>of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>, that neither was His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> left in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, nor did His flesh see corruption.</q></p>

<p><q></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:31</strong></font></u></a></span> This again is wonderful: it shows that His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a> was not like that of other men. For though death laid hold on Him, yet it did not its own work then.— And, as regards the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, he has spoken of that, covertly and darkly; of the punishment, he forbore to add anything; but that they had slain Him, this he has spoken out; for the rest he now comes to the sign given by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. And when it is once <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>, that He, the slain, was just, was dear to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, then, though thou be silent of the punishment, be sure that he which did the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> will condemn himself more than ever you can condemn him. So then, that he refers all to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, is in order that they may receive what is said: and that assertion, <q>Not possible,</q> he fetches in from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>.

<p><q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus of Nazareth</font></u></a>, a man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> (to be sent) from God unto you.</q> </p>

<p><span><strong><font size="4">Recapitulation</font></strong> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:22-31</strong></font></u></a></span>: one, of whom, by reason of His works, there can be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>; but who, on the contrary, is demonstrated. Thus also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11066b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Nicodemus</font></u></a> said, <q>No man can do these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a> which Thou doest— By <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">miracles</font></u></a>, and wonders, and signs which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> wrought by Him in the midst of you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh003.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 3:2</font></u></a></span>: not secretly. Setting out from facts notorious to those whom he was addressing, he then comes to things hidden. Thereupon [in saying, <q>By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q>]</p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:23</strong></font></u></a></span> he shows that it was not because they had the power to do it, and that there was a wisdom and a Divine arrangement in the event, seeing it was from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. He rapidly passes over the unpleasant part, [adding, <q>Whom God raised up,</q> etc.] </p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Acts 2:24</strong></font></u></a></span>. For it is always a point of great importance with them to show that He was once dead. Though you should deny it, says he, (<span>ἐ</span> <span>κεῖνοι</span>) those (present) will bear <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> to the fact. [<q>Having loosed the pangs of death.</q>] He that gives Death trouble, may much more give trouble to them that crucified Him: however, nothing of the kind is here said, as that He had power to slay you. Meanwhile, let us also learn thus to hold. For one that is in pain like a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> in travail, does not hold the thing held, and is not active but passive; and makes haste to cast it off. And it is well said: <q>For David says in reference to him</q> (v. 25); that you may not refer that saying to the Prophet.— [<q>Therefore being a Prophet, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a>,</q> etc.] (v. 30, 31.) Do you observe how he now interprets the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a>, and does not give it bare of comment? How did He <q>seat Him upon</q> David's <q>throne?</q> For the kingdom after the Spirit is in heaven. Observe how, along with the resurrection, he has also declared the kingdom in the fact of His rising again. He shows that the Prophet was under constraint: for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophecy</font></u></a> was concerning Him. Why does he say, not, Concerning His kingdom (it was a great matter), but <q>Concerning His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>?</q> And how did He seat Him upon his (David's) throne?

<p><q>This Jesus</q>— observe how he does not call Him otherwise— <q>has God raised up; whereof all we are witnesses. Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted</q> (v. 33, 34): again he takes refuge with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and yet it had been enough to say what precedes: but he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> what a great point this is. Here he has hinted at the Ascension also, and that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a> is in heaven: but neither does he say this openly. <q>And having received,</q> says he, <q>the promise of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> Observe how, in the beginning of his discourse, he does not say that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus</font></u></a> Himself had sent It, but the Father: now, however, that he has mentioned His signs and the things done to Him by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>, and has spoken of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">resurrection</font></u></a>, he boldly introduces what he has to say about these matters, again adducing themselves as witnesses by both senses: [<q>He has shed forth this, which you do see and hear.</q>] And of the resurrection he has made continual mention, but of their outrageous deed he has spoken once for all. <q>And having received the promise of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> This again is great. <q>The promise,</q> he says; because [promised] before His Passion. Observe how he now makes it all His [<q>He has poured forth this</q>], covertly making a great point. For if it was He that poured it forth, it is of Him that the Prophet has spoken above, In the last days I will pour forth of My Spirit on My Servants, and on Mine handmaids, and I will do wonders in the heaven above. </p>

But then, because it was a great thing, he again veils it with the expression of <q>His having received of the Father.</q> He has spoken of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things fulfilled, of the signs; has said, that He is king, the point that touched them; has said, that it is He that gives the Spirit. (<em>Arist. Rhet.</em> 1. 3.) (For, however much a person may say, if it does not issue in something advantageous, he speaks to no purpose.) Just as John: <q>The same,</q> says he, <q>shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptize</font></u></a> you with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat003.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 3:11</font></u></a></span> And it shows that the Cross not only did not make Him less, but rendered Him even more illustrious, seeing that of old God promised it to Him, but now has given it. Or [it may be], <q>the promise</q> which He promised to us. He so foreknew it about to be, and has given it to us greater after the resurrection. And, <q>has poured it out,</q> he says; not requiring worthiness: and not simply gave, but with abundance. Whence does this appear? Henceforth after the mention of His giving the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, he confidently speaks also of His ascension into heaven; and not only so, but again adducing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, and reminding them of that Person concerning Whom Christ once spoke. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse43" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:43</font></u></a></span> <q>For not David,</q> says he ascended into the heavens.</p>

And again, as to the act of subjugation, not to provoke unbelief, he ascribes it to the Father. Since then these are great things that he has uttered, he again brings his discourse down to lowly matters. <q>Let therefore,</q> he says, the whole house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> assuredly: i.e. question ye not, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> ye: then also in the tone of command it follows; <q>that God has made Him both Lord</q>— this he says from David— <q>and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>,</q> </p>

<p>But the admirable and great ones, and beloved of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, need none of these motives: men, such as was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>: not of the kingdom, not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, made he account.

He promises us so great things, and not even so is He worthy to be heard? What can come up to this enmity! And yet, they are mad after money-making, though it be with enemies, though it be with slaves, though it be with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> most hostile to them, that they come in contact, though it be with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> utterly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, if only they expect that they shall be enabled by their means to make money, they will do everything, will flatter, and be obsequious, and make themselves slaves, and will esteem them more to be revered than all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, to get some advantage out of them: for the hope of money does not allow them to give a thought to any such considerations as these. But the Kingdom is not so powerful as money is; nay, rather, not in the smallest proportion as powerful. For it is no ordinary Being that promises: but this is greater than even the Kingdom itself that we receive it from such a Giver! But now the case is the same as if a king, wishing, after ten thousand other benefits, to make us his heirs and coheirs with his son [should be despised]: while some captain of a band of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>, who has done ten thousand wrongs to us and to our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a>, and is himself fraught with ten thousand wickednesses, and has utterly marred our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> and our welfare, should, on presenting a single penny, receive our worship. God promises a Kingdom, and is despised: the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Devil</font></u></a> helps us to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>, and he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a>! Here <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, there Devil. But let us see the difference of the tasks enjoined. For if there were none of these considerations in the case: if it were not, here <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, there Devil; not, here one helping to a kingdom, there to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>: the nature itself of the tasks enjoined were sufficient to induce us to comply with the former. For what does each enjoin? The one, the things which make <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>; the other the things which put to shame: one, the things which involve in ten thousand calamities and disgraces; the other, the things which have with them abundant refreshment. For look: the one says, <q>Learn ye of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 11:29</font></u></a></span>: the other says, Be thou savage, and ungentle, and passionate, and wrathful, and more a wild beast than a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>. Let us see which is more useful, which, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> you, more profitable. <q>Speak not of this,</q> say you. * * * But consider that he is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>: above all indeed, if that be shown: there is need also to undergo toils, and, on the other hand, the prize of victory will be greater. For not he that enjoins easy tasks is the kind (<span>κηδεμὼν</span>) benefactor, but he that enjoins what is for our good. Since fathers also enjoin disagreeable tasks; but for this they are fathers: and so again do masters to slaves: but kidnappers and destroyers (<span>λυμεὥνες</span>) on the other hand, do just the reverse. And yet that the commands of Christ are attended with a pleasure, is manifest from that saying. For to what sort do you take the passionate man to belong, and to what the forbearing and meek? Does not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the (<span>ἐ</span> <span>κείνου</span>) one seem to be in a kind of solitary retreat, enjoying exceeding quiet; while that of (<span>τούτου</span>) the other is like a market-place and tumult and the midst of cities, where great is the clamor of those going out, the noise of camels, mules, asses: of men shouting loud to those that meet them, that they may not be trodden under foot: and again, of silver-beaters, of braziers, of men thrusting and pushing this way and that and some overborne, some overbearing? But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of (<span>τούτου</span>) the former is like some mountain-top, with its delicate air, its pure sunshine, its limpid gushing fountains, its multitude of charming flowers, while the vernal meads and gardens put on their plumage of shrubs and flowers, and glance with rifling waters: and if any sound is heard there, it is sweet, and calculated to affect the ear with a sense of much delight. For either the warbling birds perch on the outermost spray of the branching trees, and cicadas, nightingales and swallows, blended in one harmony, perform a kind of concerted music; or the zephyr gently stirring the leaves, draws whistling tones from pines and firs, resembling oft the notes of the swan: and roses, violets, and other flowers, gently swayed, and (<span>κυανίζοντα</span>) dark-dimpling, show like a sea just rippled over with gentle undulations. Nay, many are the images one might find. Thus, when one looks at the roses, one shall fancy that he beholds in them the rainbow; in the violets a waving sea; in the lilies, the sky. But not by the spectacle alone, and the beholding, does such an one then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> delight: but also in the very body of him that looks to the meadow, rather it refreshes him, and causes him to breathe freely, so that he thinks himself more in heaven than on earth. There is withal a sound of a different kind, when water from the mountain-steep, borne by its own force through ravines gently plashes over its pebbly bed with lulling noise, and so relaxes our frame with the pleasurable sensations, as quickly to draw over our eyes the soft languor of slumber. You have heard the description with pleasure: perhaps also it has made you enamored of solitude. But sweeter far than this solitude is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> * * of the long-suffering. For it was not for the sake of describing a meadow, nor for the sake of making a display of language, that we have broached this similitude: but the object was, that, seeing how great is the delight of the long suffering, and how, by converse with a long suffering man, one would be far more both delighted and benefited, than by frequenting such spots, you may follow after such men. For when not even a breath of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> proceeds from such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, but mild and engaging words, then indeed does that gentle softness of the zephyr find its counterpart: entreaties also, devoid of all arrogance, but forming the resemblance to those winged warblers,— how is not this far better? For not the body is fanned by the soft breeze of speech; no, it refreshes our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> heated and glowing. A physician, by ever so great attention, could not so speedily rid a man of the fever, as a patient man would cool, by the breath of his own words, a person who was passionate and burning with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. And why do I speak of a physician? Not even iron, made red-hot and dipped into water, so quickly parts with its heat, as does the passionate man when he comes in contact with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the long-suffering. But as, if it chance that singing birds find their way into the market, they go for nothing there, just so is it with our precepts when they light upon <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> addicted to wrathful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. Assuredly, sweeter is gentleness than bitterness and frowardness.— Well, but the one was God's bidding, the other the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil's</font></u></a>. Do you see that it was not for nothing that I said, even if there were no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> or God in the case, the things enjoined would be enough in themselves to (<span>ἀ</span> <span>ποστἥσαι</span>) revolt us? For the one is both agreeable to himself, and serviceable to others, the other displeasing to himself, and hurtful to others. Nothing is more unpleasant than a man in a passion, nothing more noisome, more odious, more shocking, as also nothing more pleasing than one who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not what it is to be in a passion. Better dwell with a wild beast than with a passionate man. For the beast, when once tamed, abides by its law; but the man, no matter how often you have tamed him, again turns wild, unless however he should of himself settle down into some such habit (of gentleness).</p>
<p>For as a bright sunny day and winter with all its gloom, so are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a> and that of the gentle. However, let us at present look not to the mischievous consequences resulting to others, but to those which affect the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> themselves: though indeed it is also no slight mischief (to one's self) to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> ill to another, for the present, however, let that be the consideration. What executioner with his lash can so lacerate the ribs, what red-hot lancets (<span>ὀ</span> <span>βελίσκοι</span>) ever so pierced the body, what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> can so dispossess a man of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">natural</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">reason</font></u></a>, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> and rage do? I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> many instances of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> engendering diseases by giving loose to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>: and the worst of fevers are precisely these. But if they so injure the body, think of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. For do not argue that you do not see the mischief, but rather consider, if that which is the recipient of the malignant passion is so hurt, what must be the hurt sustained by that which engenders it! Many have lost their eyes, many have fallen into most grievous disease. Yet he that bears bravely, shall endure all things easily. But, however, both such are the troublesome tasks the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> enjoins, and the wages he assigns us for these is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. He is both <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> and foe to our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and we rather do his bidding than Christ's, Saviour as He is, and Benefactor and Defender, and speaking as He does such words, which are both sweeter, and more reverend, and more profitable and beneficial, and are both to ourselves and to those who live in our company the greatest of blessings. Nothing worse than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, my beloved, nothing worse than unseasonable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. It will not have any long delay; it is a quick, sharp passion. Many a time has a mere word been blurted out in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, which needs for its curing a whole lifetime, and a deed been done which was the ruin of the man for life. For the worst of it is this, that in a little moment, and by one act, and by a single word, full oft has it cast us out from the possession of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> good, and brought to nought a world of pains.

Thus far, however, I have spoken concerning meekness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>; if one should take in hand to treat of other opposites, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> and the mad passion for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, contrasted with contempt of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; intemperance with sobriety; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a> with benevolence; and to marshal them each against its opposite, then one would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how great the difference.

<p><q>Now when they heard these words (E.V. 'this,') they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</q></p>
<p>Do you see what a great thing gentleness is? More than any vehemence, it pricks our hearts, inflicts a keener wound. For as in the case of bodies which have become callous, the man that strikes upon them does not affect the sense so powerfully, but if he first mollify them and make them tender, then he pierces them effectually; so in this instance also, it is necessary first to mollify. But that which softens, is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, not vehement accusation, not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210107.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">personal abuse</font></u></a>; it is gentleness. The former indeed rather aggravate the callousness, this last alone removes it. If then you are desirous to reprove any delinquent, approach him with all possible mildness. For see here; he gently reminds them of the outrages they have committed, adding no comment; he declares the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210107.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gift</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, he goes on to speak of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> which bore testimony to the event, and so draws out his discourse to a still greater length. So they stood in awe of the gentleness of Peter, in that he, speaking to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210107.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> who had crucified his Master, and breathed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> against himself and his companions, discoursed to them in the character of an affectionate father and teacher. Not merely were they persuaded; they even condemned themselves, they came to a sense of their past behavior. For he gave no room for their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> to be roused, and darken their judgment, but by means of humility he dispersed, as it were, the mist and darkness of their indignation, and then pointed out to them the daring outrage they had committed. For so it is; when we say of ourselves that we are injured, the opposite party <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210107.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">endeavor</font></u></a> to prove that they have not done the injury; but when we say, we have not been injured, but have rather done the wrong, the others take the contrary line. If, therefore, you wish to place your enemy (<span>εἰς ἀγώνα</span>) in the wrong, beware of accusing him; nay (<span>ἀ</span> <span>γώνισαι</span>), plead for him, he will be sure to find himself guilty. There is a natural spirit of opposition in man. Such was the conduct of Peter. He did not accuse them harshly; on the contrary, he almost endeavored to plead for them, as far as was possible. And this was the very reason that he penetrated into their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. You will ask, where is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> that they were pricked? In their own words; for what say they? <q>Men and brethren, what shall we do?</q> Whom they had called deceivers, they call <q>brethren:</q> not that hereby they put themselves on an equality with them, but rather by way of attracting their brotherly affection and kindness: and besides, because the Apostles had deigned to call them by this title. And, say they, <q>What shall we do?</q> They did not straightway say, Well then, we repent; but they surrendered themselves to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>. Just as a person on the point of shipwreck, upon seeing the pilot, or in sickness the physician, would put all into his hands, and do his bidding in everything; so have these also confessed that they are in extreme peril, and destitute of all hope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. They did not say, How shall we be saved? But, <q>What shall we do?</q> Here again Peter, though the question is put to all, is the man to answer. <q>Repent,</q> says he, <q>and be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a> every one of you, in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>

And this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> too passed over to the place; the eating in the house. In what house? In the Temple. Observe the increase of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. They cast away their riches, and rejoiced, and had great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>, for greater were the riches they received without labor (<span>ἄ</span> <span>πονα</span> Cat. al. <span>ἀ</span> <span>γαθά</span>). None reproached, none envied, none grudged; no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, no contempt was there. As children they did indeed account themselves to be under teaching: as new born babes, such was their disposition. Yet why use this faint image? If you remember how it was when God shook our city with an earthquake, how subdued all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> were. (<em>Infra</em>, Hom. xli. §2.) Such was the case then with those converts. No knavery, no villany then: such is the effect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, of affliction! No talk of <q>mine</q> and <q>yours</q> then. Hence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a> waited at their table; no one seemed to eat of his own, or of another's—I grant this may seem a riddle. Neither did they consider their brethren's property foreign to themselves; it was the property of a Master; nor again deemed they anything their own, all was the brethren's. The poor man <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> no shame, the rich no haughtiness. This is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">gladness</font></u></a>. The latter deemed himself the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> and fortunate party; the others felt themselves as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> herein, and closely were they bound together.

They conceived no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a> toward each other; they committed all to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. [<q>With all the people.</q>] Fear there was none; yea, though they had taken their position in the midst of dangers. By <em>singleness</em>, however, he denotes their entire <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, far surpassing their contempt of riches, their abstinence, and their preseverance in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>. For thus also they offered pure praise to God: this is to praise God. But observe also here how they immediately obtain their reward. <q>Having favor with all the people.</q> They were engaging, and highly beloved. For who would not prize and admire their simplicity of character; who would not be linked to one in whom was nothing underhand? To whom too does <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> belong, but to these? To whom those great marvels? Was it not to shepherds that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> was first preached? And to Joseph, being a man of simple <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, insomuch that he did not let a suspicion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> frighten him into doing wrong? Did not God elect rustics, those artless men?

For when you suspect no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, neither can you fabricate any: when you have no annoyances, neither can you remember injuries. Has any one insulted you? You were not pained. Has any one reviled you? You were nothing hurt. Has he envied you? Still you had no hurt. Simplicity is a high road to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>. None so beautiful in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> as the simple. For as in regard of personal appearance, he that is sullen, and downcast, and reserved (<span>σύννους</span>), even if he be good-looking, loses much of his beauty; while he that relaxes his countenance, and gently smiles, enhances his good looks; so in respect of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, he that is reserved, if he have ten thousand good points, disfigures them; but the frank and simple, just the reverse. A man of this last description may be safely made a friend, and when at variance easily reconciled. No need of guards and outposts, no need of chains and fetters with such an one; but great is his own freedom, and that of those who associate with him. But what, you will say, will such a man do if he fall among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> people? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, Who has commanded us to be simple-minded, will stretch out His hand. What was more guileless than David? What more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> than Saul? Yet who triumphed? Again, in Joseph's case; did not he in simplicity approach his master's wife, she him with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> art? Yet what, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, was he the worse? Furthermore, what more simple than was Abel? What more malicious than Cain? And Joseph again, had he not dealt artlessly with his brethren? Was not this the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of his eminence, that he spoke out unsuspiciously, while they received his words in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a>? He declared once and again his dreams unreservedly; and then again he set off to them carrying provisions; he used no caution; he committed all to God: nay, the more they held him in the light of an enemy, the more did he treat them as brothers. God had power not to have suffered him to fall into their hands; but that the wonder might be made manifest, how, though they do their worst, he shall be higher than they: though the blow do come upon him, it comes from another, not from himself. On the contrary, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> man strikes himself first, and none other than himself. <q>For alone,</q> it is said, <q>shall he bear his troubles.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro009.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 9:12</font></u></a></span> Ever in him the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is full of dejection, his thoughts being ever entangled: whether he must hear anything or say anything, he does all with complaints, with accusation. Far, very far from such do friendship and harmony make their abode: but fightings are there, and enmities, and all unpleasantness. They that are such suspect even themselves. To these not even sleep is sweet, nor anything else. And have they a wife also, lo, they are enemies and at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with all: what endless jealousies, what unceasing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>! Aye, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, <span>πονηρὸς</span> has his name from <span>πονεἵν</span>, <q>to have trouble.</q> And, indeed, thus the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> is ever calling <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a></q> by the name of labor; as, for instance, <q>Under his tongue is toil and labor;</q> and again, <q>In the midst of them is toil and labor.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa010.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 10:7</font></u></a>; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa090.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">90:10</font></u></a>; and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa055.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">55:11</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>Now if any one should wonder, whence those who had at first been of this last class, now are so different, let him learn that affliction was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, affliction, that school-mistress of heavenly wisdom, that mother of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>. When riches were done away with, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> also disappeared. True, say you, for this is the very thing I am asking about; but whence comes all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a> there is now? How is it that it came into the minds of those three thousand and five thousand straightway, to choose <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and that they simultaneously became <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophers</font></u></a>, whereas now hardly one is to be found? How was it that they then were in such harmony? What was it, that made them resolute and active? What was it that so suddenly inflamed them? The reason is, that they drew near with much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>; that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a> were not so sought after as they are now; that they transferred their thoughts to things future, and looked for nothing of things present. This is the sign of an ardent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, to encounter perils; this was their idea of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christianity</font></u></a>. We take a different view, we seek our comfort here. The result is, that we shall not even obtain this, when the time has come. <q>What are we to do?</q> asked those men. We, just the contrary— <q>What shall we do?</q> What behooved to be done, they did. We, quite the reverse. Those men condemned themselves, despaired of saving themselves. This is what made them such as they were. They <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> what a gift they had received. But how can you become like them, when you do everything in an opposite spirit? They heard, and were immediately <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">baptized</font></u></a>. They did not speak those cold words which we do now, nor did they contrive delays (p. 47, note 3); and yet they had heard all the requirements: but that word, <q>Save yourselves from this generation,</q> made them to be not sluggish; rather they welcomed the exhortation; and that they did welcome it, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a> by their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a>, they showed what manner of men they were. They entered at once the lists, and took off the coat; whereas we do enter, but we intend to fight with our coat on. This is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> that our antagonist has so little trouble, for we get entangled in our own movements, and are continually thrown down. We do precisely the same thing as he who, having to cope with a man frantic, breathing fire; and seeing him, a professed wrestler, covered with dust, tawny, stripped, clotted with dirt from the sand and sun, and running down with sweat and oil and dirt; himself, smelling of perfumes, should put on his silken garments, and his gold shoes, and his robe hanging down to his heels, and his golden trinkets on the head, and so descend into the arena, and grapple with him. Such a one will not only be impeded, but being taken up with the sole idea of not staining or rending his fine clothes, will tumble at the very first onset, and withal will suffer that which he chiefly dreaded, the damage of those his fond delights. The time for the contest has come, and say, are you putting on your silks? It is the time of exercise, the hour of the race, and are you adorning yourself as for a procession? Look not to outward things, but to the inward. For by the thoughts about these things the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is hampered on all sides, as if by strong cords, so that she cannot let you raise a hand, or contend against the adversary; and makes you soft and effeminate. One may think himself, even when released from all these ties, well off, to be enabled to conquer that impure power. And on this account Christ too did not allow the parting with riches alone to suffice, but what says He? <q>Sell whatsoever you have, and give to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, and come and follow Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mar010.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mark 10:21</font></u></a></span> Now if, even when we cast away our riches, we are not yet in a safe position, but stand still in need of some further art and close practice; much more, if we retain them, shall we fail to achieve great things, and, instead thereof, become a laughing-stock to the spectators, and to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> one himself. For even though there were no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, though there were none to wrestle with us, yet ten thousand roads on all sides lead the lover of money to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a>. Where now are they who ask why the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> was made (<span>διατί ὁ δ. γέγονεν</span>;)? Behold here the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> has no hand in the work, we do it all ourselves. Of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> they of the hills might have a right to speak thus, who after they had given <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proof</font></u></a> of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14481a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temperance</font></u></a>, their contempt of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and disregard of all such things, have infinitely preferred to abandon father, and houses, and lands, and wife, and children. Yet, they are the last to speak so: but the men who at no time ought to say it, these do say it. Those are indeed wrestlings with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>; these he does not think worth entering into. You will say, But it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> who instils this same <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. Well, flee from it, do not harbor it, O man. Suppose now, you see one flinging out filth from some upper story, and at the same time a person seeing it thrown out, yet standing there and receiving it all on his head: you not only do not pity him, but you are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, and tell him it serves him right; and, <q>Do not be a fool,</q> everyone cries out to him, and lays the blame not so much on the other for shooting out the filth, as on him for letting it come on him. But now, you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> is of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>; you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that it is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of ten thousand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>; you see him flinging out, like filth, his noisome imaginations; and do you not see that you are receiving on your bare head his nastiness, when it needed but to turn aside a little to escape it altogether? Just as our man by shifting his position would have escaped; so, do you refuse to admit such imaginations, ward off the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. And how am I to do this? You will ask. Were you a Gentile, and had eyes for things present alone, the matter perhaps might be one of considerable difficulty, and yet even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> have achieved as much; but you— a man in expectation of heaven and heavenly bliss— and you to ask, <q>How am I to repel bad thoughts?</q> Were I saying the contrary, then you might <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>: did I say, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covet</font></u></a> riches, <q>How shall I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covet</font></u></a> riches,</q> you might answer, <q>seeing such things as I do?</q> Tell me, if gold and precious stones were set before you, and I were to say, Desire lead, would there not be reason for hesitation? For you would say, How can I? But if I said, Do not desire it; this had been plainer to understand. I do not marvel at those who despise, but at those who despise not riches. This is the character of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> exceeding full of stupidity, no better than flies and gnats, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> crawling upon the earth, wallowing in filth, destitute of all high ideas. What is it you say? Are you destined to inherit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life; and do you say, how shall I despise the present life for the future? What, can the things be put in competition? You are to receive a royal vest; and say you, How shall I despise these rags? You are going to be led into the king's palace; and do you say, How shall I despise this present hovel? Of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, we ourselves are to blame in every point, we who do not choose to let ourselves be stirred up ever so little. For the willing have succeeded, and that with great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> and facility. Would that you might be persuaded by our exhortation, and succeed too, and become imitators of those who have been successful, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> together be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, and power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

<div><strong>2:1 Pentecost</strong> is explained as the completion of fifty days, at this feast the descent of the Spirit took place, first, because there were three illustrious feasts according to the Law; the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, in which all the Jews in every place gathered together to Jerusalem. (Ishodad of Merv) It should be noted that among the ancients the day of Pentecost was computed from the time of the killing of the pascal lamb. In our case, however, it is not from the Lord's passion, but from his resurrection. (St. Bede) <strong>one place:</strong> The Law was given on Mount Sinai, the Spirit on Mount <font color="#000000">Sion</font>, the Law on an elevated place in the mountain, the Spirit in an upper room. (Rabanus Maurus) When the Jews were assembled in the Temple to pray, the Disciples were assembled, hiding in the upper room. (Ishodad of Merv)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:2 of a mighty wind:</strong> this betokens the exceeding vehemence of the Spirit, <font color="#0000ff" size="1">1</font>but not for the apostles’ sake, but because of the Jews who were then present. Observe how it is always, <em>as of</em>; and rightly: that you may have no gross sensible notions of the Spirit, therefore it was not a wind. (St. John Chrysostom<font size="1"> <font color="#0000ff">1</font>Com. on Matt.)</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:3 appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire: </strong>The Spirit was manifested in the form of fire for many reasons, first, because it is a quality of the Lord that He is seen in fire, as with Abraham and Moses and Manoah and Elia; second, because the Lord also is called fire, <i>For our God is a consuming fire<font size="1"> </font></i><font size="1">(Heb 12:29)</font>, third, to show that the Giver of both Covenants is the same ; and just as He gave the first one in fire, thus He gave also this second one; and just as there He was seen in a flame in a bush, and the bush was not burnt, thus also here, the fire was a flame upon the hair, and the hair was not consumed. Forth, just as fire on the one hand burns up straw and stubble, and on the other hand liberates gold, the noble thing, and <font color="#000000">silver</font>, etc; thus the Spirit on the one hand burns sinful things, and on the other hand cleanses and purifies the Saints. (Ishodad of Merv) Thus they were entirely baptized according to the promise, and invested soul and body with a divine garment of salvation. They partook of fire, not of burning but of saving fire; of fire which consumes the thorns of sins, but gives lustre to the soul, (St. Cyril of Jerusalem<font size="1"> Cat Lect.</font>)  So then, the thorns were consumed, that is, the transgression from Adam was consumed. (<font size="1"><font size="2">Severus of Antioch</font> Catena on Acts</font>) <strong>sat upon every one of them:</strong> The gift which the <font color="#000000">women</font> who were there received was not for preisthood, nor Apostleship, for these were never given to the company of women; but for prophecy and speaking with new tongues; for they received the gift of Baptism both to become also Christian believers, and to receive adoption. (Ishodad of Merv)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:4 they were all filled with the Holy Spirit:</strong> Before the Passion the Holy Spirit was given to the Apostles for the grace of doctrine and healing; after the Resurrection Jesus breathed the Spirit upon them and said: . . . . On Pentecost <em>Accept the Holy Spirit, whose sins you shall forgive, are forgiven them</em> etc... the Spirit was sent from Heaven, so that those who were to be divided on the morrow would accept the knowledge of tongues, lest they be in need of interpreters as they went forth throughout the world. (Nicholas of Lyra)<strong> speak with divers tongues: </strong>The Galilean Peter or Andrew spoke Persian or Median. John and the rest of the Apostles spoke every tongue to those of Gentile extraction; The Holy Spirit taught them many languages at once, languages which in all their life they never knew. This is in truth vast wisdom, this is power divine. What a contrast of their long ignorance in time past to their sudden, complete and varied and unaccustomed exercise of these languages! (St. Cyril of Jerusalem<font size="1"> Cat Lect</font>)  To sow the seeds of heavenly doctrine throughout peoples of every language required tongues imbued with heavenly doctrine and aflame with the fire of evangelical love. This was, therefore, the primary sign of evangelical faith, the sign the Lord had promised to them, saying, "<i>They shall speak in new tongues</i>."<font size="1">(Mk 16:17)</font> (Erasmus)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:5 Jews:</strong> <span lang="EN">This strictly referred to the descendants of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, that remained faithful and formed the kingdom of Judah, unlike the ten other tribes that fell into schism under Jeroboam. These latter were called Israelites. In course of time, however, the term “Jews” embraced, without distinction, all the descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel. (Bishop John McEvilly)</span><br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:6 heard them speak in his own tongue:</strong> Was it while speaking in one language they should be understood by all, or that they should speak in all languages? It was more fitting that they should speak in all languages, because this pertained to the perfection of their knowledge, whereby they were able not only to speak, but also to understand what was said by others. Whereas if their one language were intelligible to all, this would either have been due to the knowledge of those who understood their speech, or it would have amounted to an illusion, since a man's words would have had a different sound in another's ears, from that with which they were uttered. (St. Thomas Aquinas<font size="1"> Summa Theologica 2.176.</font>) <span lang="EN">Of this we have an example in the life of St. Francis Xavier, who speaking one tongue was understood by different peoples as if he were speaking their own language. (Bishop John McEvilly)</span> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:7 Galileans:</strong> This word was a well-known term as a reproach among the Jews, which makes this miracle that much more amazing to them. (Bishop John McEvilly)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:8</strong> Was it that the speakers expressed what they had to say in the diverse discourse of every language, or, when there were hearers of diverse nations, each of them would perceive what they heard in terms of his own language and would grasp the meaning of that one and the same discourse which had been uttered by the apostle? (St. Gregory Nazianzus<font size="1"> Orations</font>)  Peter's discourse below<font size="1"> (2:37-41)</font> shows that he does not seem to give a repetition in different languages successively, but rather an immediate understandng and acceptance by the whole crowd, and that they equally grasped the apostle's words in whatever language they may have been delivered. (St. Bede)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2:9-11</strong> The <b><i>Parthians</i></b> are Persians. The <i><b>Elamites</b></i> are the people of Elan and of Dailom; places that are contigueous to one another. (Ishodad of Merv) Here is mention made of nations that were hostile to them, <strong>Cretans, Arabians, Egyptians, Persians:</strong> and that they would conquer them all was here made manifest. But as to their being in those countries, they were there in captivity, many of them: or else, the doctrines of the Law had become disseminated among the <font color="#333333">Gentiles</font> in those countries. So then the testimony comes from all quarters: from citizens, from foreigners, from proselytes. (St. John Chrysostom)  <b><i>Judea</i></b> does not signify the entire nation, but part of it, that is, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, especially in distinction from Samaria, Galilee, Decapolis, and other regions in the same province. There, although all spoke one language, Hebrew, nevertheless each region had a distinct local way of talking. <strong>Proselytes</strong>, that is, foreigners, was the term applied to those who, although their origin was from the pagan nations, preferred to choose circumcison and Judaism.

The interval between our Lord's death and the final end of all things was comparatively very brief, and the woes that befell Jerusalem were only a type of those that are to take place at the end of the world.

(St. Jerome<font size="1"> Commentary on Ps</font>)  But what He says, namely, <b>sit at my right hand:</b> can be referred to the divine nature in which Christ is equal to the Father, because He has judiciary and royal power equal to the Father: ‘<i>All that the Father has are mine</i>’<font size="1"> (Jn. 16:15)</font>. Indeed, the Father Himself said this from eternity, because He engendered the Son by speaking, and by engendering gave Him equality with the Father. It can also be referred to the human nature, according to which He sits near the transcendent goods of the Father. In this case the Father spoke, when He joined His Word to a human nature.  But why does he say, <b>footstool</b>? Perhaps because that word signifies nothing more than full and perfect subjection, for that is said to be perfectly subject to someone which he can tread under foot; or because just as God is the head of Christ, as it says in 1 Cor. (11:3), so Christ’s feet would be His humanity: ‘We shall adore in the place where his feet stood’ (Ps. 131:7).

<div><font color="#333333"><strong>2:38 </strong><font color="#000000"><strong>Do penance: </strong>He had admonished men to do penance before admonishing them to be baptized, this would be because also before Baptism some kind of penance is required. Confession is a part of sacramental Penance, which is not required before Baptism, but the inward virtue of Penance is required. Moreover, the penance which precedes Baptism is not the sacrament of Penance. (St. Thomas Aquinas <font size="1">Com. on Hebrews 6:2; Summa Theo.</font>)  For, being about to speak of baptism, he spoke first of the lamentations of penitence; that they should first bathe themselves in the water of their own affliction, and afterwards wash themselves in the Sacrament of Baptism. With what conscience, then, can those who neglect to weep for their past misdeeds live secure of pardon, when the chief pastor (Peter) of the Church himself believed that penitence must be added even to this Sacrament which chiefly extinguishes sins? (St. Gregory the Great<font size="1"> Pastorial Rules</font>) <b>and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ:</b> Saving holy Baptism suffices for our cleansing of sin, and erases the stain of previous falls. (St. Cyril<font size="1"> Commentary on Isaiah</font>)  First indeed we say that it is not meant that baptism is administered in Christ's name alone, but that a person is baptized with the baptism of Christ, that is, spiritually, not Judaically. (Theophylact <font size="1">Commentary on Luke</font>)  For the case of the Jews under the apostles was one thing, but the condition of the Gentiles is another. The Jews, because they had already gained the most ancient baptism of the law and Moses, were to be baptized also in the name of Jesus Christ. Peter makes mention of Jesus Christ, not as though the Father should be omitted, but that the Son also might </font><font color="#333333">be joined to the Father. (St. Cyprian of Carthage<font size="1"> Letter</font>) <b>And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit:</b> This is, the sacrament of confirmation unto renovation: ‘<i>By the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Spirit</i>’ (Titus. 3:5). For in confirmation the Holy Spirit is given for strength to enable a man to boldly confess Christ’s name before men. For just as in the natural order a man is first born and then grows and becomes strong, so, too, in the order of grace. Hence Pope Melchiades says: "The Holy Spirit, Who comes down on the waters of Baptism bearing salvation in His flight, bestows at the font, the fulness of innocence; but in Confirmation He confers an increase of grace. In Baptism we are born again unto life; after Baptism we are strengthened</font><font color="#333333">." Christ, by the power which He exercises in the sacraments, bestowed on </font><font color="#333333">the apostles the reality of this sacrament, i.e. the fulness of the Holy Spirit, without the sacrament itself, because they had received "the first fruits of the Spirit" (Romans 8:23). In like manner, too, when the apostles imposed their hands, and when they preached, the fulness of the Holy Spirit came down under visible signs on the faithful. However, the apostles commonly made use of chrism in bestowing the sacrament, when such like visible signs were lacking. Now the grace of the Holy Spirit is signified by oil; hence Christ is said to be "<i>anointed with the oil of gladness</i>" (Psalm 44:8), by reason of His being gifted with the fulness of the Holy Spirit. Consequently oil is a suitable matter of </font><font color="#333333">this sacrament. Pierre de Tarentaise, (Sent. iv, D, 7) held that it was instituted by the apostles. But this cannot be admitted; since the institution of a new sacrament belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to Christ alone. And therefore we must say that Christ instituted this sacrament not by bestowing, but by promising it, according to John 16:7: "<i>If I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you</i>." And this was because in this sacrament the fulness of the Holy Spirit is bestowed, which was not to be given before Christ's Resurrection and Ascension; according to John 7:39: "<i>As yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified</i>."</font><font color="#000000"> (St. Thomas Aquinas<font size="1"> Summa Theologica</font>)</font></font></div>

<div><span lang="EN"><span lang="EN"><strong>2:45</strong> <span lang="EN">The infant Church of Jerusalem was modeled on the life of our Lord and His Apostles. The same mode of life is still continued in religious communities whose members, for greater perfection sake, have everything in common, without any private property. This economy was confined to the Church of Jerusalem. The Apostles in preaching the Gospel did not think fit to establish it generally. Indeed the exhortations of St. Paul to have collections made for relieving the poor (2 Cor. 11) would show there was no such condition of things among the churches he founded. The condition of the Church of Jerusalem was peculiar. Owing to the confiscation of property, it was very poor (Heb. 10:54, 13:2-3, 16). St. John had property (John 19:27). Neither did our Lord nor His Apostles command the faithful to throw all their property into a common fund. The condition of things among the first Christians of Jerusalem gives no sanction whatever to the wicked principles of modern communism, which are simply impracticable and absurd. Unlike the wicked principles or practice advocated by these disturbers of public order, the community of goods referred to here was: 1, spontaneous (Acts 5: 4); 2, local and special, confined to the Church of Jerusalem, as appears from the collections set on foot by St. Paul in other churches, in which he supposed they retained their possessions, to relieve the necessities of the saints (1 Cor. 16:2 Cor. 9); 3, transitory. even in the Church of Jerusalem itself; (this economy the Apostles did not think fit to establish in other churches); 4, not essential to the existence or well-being of the church or salvation of men; (St. Peter, on being asked what was necessary for salvation, only inculcated Baptism and Penance); 5, neither did our Lord or His Apostles insist upon it. On the contrary, St. Paul in several of his Epistles inculcates alms deeds, and speaks of them as free by no means compulsory. (Bishop John McEvilly)</span></span></span></div>

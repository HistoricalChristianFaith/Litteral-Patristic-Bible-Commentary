</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>1 (Jos
1,5).</strong> The Lord says to Joshua Nave: And since I was with Moses, so I will be
with you. Not only because of this testimony, but also because of many texts of
Deuteronomy, it is proved that Moses died as a servant of God and pleasing God,
even though the punishment was fulfilled in him that he would not enter the
promised land (Cf Dt 32,48-52; 34,4-5). This shows that the Lord can also get
angry at something with his good servants and punish them temporarily, and yet
he can count them in the number of those who are in his house as honorable
instruments useful to his Lord (Cf 2Tm 2,21), to whom he will give the promises
made to the saints.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>2 (Jos
1,11).</strong> The question arises of knowing how, after the Lord had spoken to Joshua
Ship, exhorting him and confirming him and promising him that he would be with
him, Joshua himself sent the people through the scribes to prepare provisions,
because after three days they would cross the Jordan , when in fact many more
days passed before they passed the Jordan. After having sent this to the
people, Joshua sent spies to Jericho, because, past the Jordan, it was the
nearest city. They left to go to the home of the prostitute Rahab, who hid
them. The king looked for them and could not find them. She let them escape
through a window and advised them to hide for three days in the mountains. In
all these events, four days may have been used (Cf Jos 2,3-6). So, after the
spies told how the situation was around them, Joshua started tomorrow's march
with the whole town from where he was. When he reached the Jordan, he withdrew
and stayed there. The people again receive another harangue to prepare
themselves to cross the Jordan after three days, leading the Ark of the Lord to
the front.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3">From this
it is deduced that it was a human disposition by means of which the people were
ordered to prepare provisions, as if they were going to cross the mentioned
river after three days. Joshua could, indeed, hope, as a man, that all this
could be done, if the spies had returned soon. But, taking them, although the
Scripture does not say it, it is understood that the other things were
fulfilled by divine disposition, so that Joshua began to be held in great
esteem before the people and to show that the Lord was with him how he had been
with Moses. For when he was about to cross the Jordan, the following is said as
it is written: And the Lord said to Joshua, "On this day I will begin to
exalt you before all the children of Israel, so that they may know that, as I
was with Moses, so shall I be. also with you (Jos 3,7).” And it should not seem
incredible to us that those with whom God spoke wanted to do something by human
decision, in which they trusted that they had God for guidance and that the
decisions they had made had been changed by the providence of God, who guided
them . Because even Moses himself, naturally as a man, had thought that he
should judge the causes of the people in such a way that it would not be of
benefit to himself or to the people themselves bearing an unbearable weight.
And this decision of his was changed by the intervention of God, while his own
father-in-law suggested and advised him himself and God approved this advice of
the father-in-law (Cf Ex 18,13-26).</font></span><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><font size="3"><strong>3 (Jos
3,3-4).</strong> The scribes say to the people: When you see the ark of the covenant of
the Lord our God and our priests and Levites carrying it, go out of your places
and go after it. But let there be a great distance between you and her. You
will be about two thousand cubits. Do not approach her. So you know the way you
have to go, because you have not gone down that road neither yesterday nor
yesterday. The ark had to go far enough, so that the town could see it. Because
if such a large crowd had gone near the ark, I could not see it go ahead or
know where I had to go. From this fact it is deduced that that column of cloud,
which used to give the signal to set up the camp and point the way, had already
withdrawn and did not appear to them. This is also due to the fact that this
departure had to be announced three days in advance by a human decision. Now,
under the guidance of Joshua, they follow the ark of the Lord without the
cloud, which has disappeared, as if the veil had been removed. But the Jordan
was full to the brim as in the days of wheat harvest (Jos 3,15). This data
seems incredible for our regions; but there, as those who have seen it say, the
beginning of spring is the time of the wheat harvest, and then that river is
fuller than during the winter.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

away? (Cf Mt 24,35) Or is it that these stones mean something eternal, even
though they can not be eternal? The Greek phrase, eos tou aionos, could,
however, be translated into Latin by usque in saeculum (forever). And this does
not mean that it has to be understood as "eternally".</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

5,2).</strong> The Lord said to Joshua, "Make yourselves sharp stone knives, or, as
the Greek says, of sharp stone and start circumcising the children of Israel
again." In relation to this precept, the question arises of knowing why it
was said again, when no man had to be circumcised twice. Well, it is said again
because the people were circumcised in some of their individuals and not in
others. And so it is said that the circumcised is circumcised again; not man,
but the people. What follows demonstrates what we affirm. The Scripture says:
And Joshua made himself sharp knives of stone and circumcised the children of
Israel in the place called Collado de los Prepucios. For this reason Joshua
circumcised the children of Israel. To all those who had been on the journey,
and to those who were uncircumcised of those who had left Egypt, all of these
were circumcised by Joshua. For Israel had lived forty-two years in the
wilderness of Mabdarit and, therefore, they were uncircumcised from among them
many of the warriors who had left the land of Egypt, who had disobeyed the
commands of God, and the Lord He had promised that they would not see the land
he had sworn to give his parents, land that flows with milk and honey. Instead
of these he put his sons, whom Joshua circumcised, since they had not been
circumcised on the road (Jos 5,2-7).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">It is
evident, therefore, that not everyone was uncircumcised, but only some. Some
children of those who had left Egypt had not been circumcised in that town, and
Joshua could circumcise them. It is about the children of those who begot in
the wilderness and despised circumcising them because they were disobedient to
the law of God. There is no reason to think that this testimony of the law
serves those who believe that baptism should be repeated to those who have
already received the sacrament of Christian baptism, because in reality no man
was circumcised twice. Only the people were circumcised, who had already been
circumcised in some of its members, but in others not yet. And if it were possible
for God to somehow command a man to be circumcised twice, could anyone say that
this was commanded because those Israelites had been circumcised by the
Egyptians or by some heretics, separated from the Israelite community? Well, as
the motive for which God commanded it appears quite clearly, men can find no
defense here of their error.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

when he answered him, he told him that he was the leader of the army of the Lord's
army, and Joshua, prostrate on the ground, replied: "What do you command
your servant? (Jos 5,15), we can ask if Joshua prostrated himself before an
angel and called him Lord or, rather, understanding who had sent him, called
him Lord and prostrated himself before him. Joshua, as the text says, was in
Jericho, not in the city itself, whose walls had not yet fallen, which would
happen immediately, so that the Israelites could enter the city, but was in the
field adjoining the city, as the translation of the Hebrew says.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><strong>8 (Jos
7,1).</strong> The text says that Akar, of the tribe of Judah, stole something from
the anathema of the city of Jericho against the commandment of the Lord and
that for this sin three thousand men, who had been sent to Ay, turned their
backs on the enemies and they killed some thirty-six of them, and while the
people were terribly terrified, Joshua prostrated himself with the elders
before the Lord, and the Lord answered that this had happened because the
people had sinned. God also threatened him saying that he would not be with
them again if they did not remove the anathema out of their midst. And he also
says that he who had done this was discovered and given to death not only he,
but he with all his family. Regarding this, it is often asked how it is lawful
to take revenge with justice against one for the sins of another, especially
considering that the Lord said in the law that parents would not be punished
for the sins of their children, nor would they be punished. children for the
sins of the parents (Cf Dt 24,16). Or was it commanded when men judge, namely,
that no one be punished for another, but the judgments of God are not like
those of men, he who knows, by his high and invisible counsel, until what
should it also extend men's temporary pain and healthy fear? In the
administration of the universe nothing cruel happens to mortals when they die,
since they have to die. In those who fear these things, the law sanctions that
not only each one take his precautions in the town, but that they pay attention
to each other and that some are caring members of others as members of one body
and one man (Cf 1Co 12,12.25).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But we
must not think that one can be condemned by another even with the penalties
that apply after death. This penalty applies only to things that will come to
an end, even if they did not end in this way. At the same time, it also reveals
the close relationship that exists in the society of the people with the
totality of the individuals, so that each individual is not valued in himself,
but they are valued as the parts in a whole. Thus, because of the sin of only
one and the death of a few, the entire town received the warning that what the
whole body had admitted in a certain way was being investigated. At the same
time, the great evil that would follow if the whole assembly had sinned was
also indicated, when not even one could be judged so that through it all the
rest could be safe. But if Akar, found and imprisoned by someone, had been
taken to be judged by Joshua as the defendant of that crime, we should not
think at all that the judge man was to punish for him or with him anyone else
who was not guilty by have been associated with their action. For the judge was
not allowed to exceed the imperative of the law that has been given to men, so
that, based on their judgment, commanded or allowed man against man, do not
think that one can be punished for the sin of another . God, on the other hand,
judges with a much more mysterious justice, he who can liberate or punish even
after death, something that man can not do (Cf St 4,12). Thus, the visible
afflictions or the deaths of men, since not only can they harm, but take
advantage of those to whom they are inferred, the Lord, in the mystery of his
providence, knows how and to whom he can give them justice, even when it seems
who takes revenge for one another's sins. On the other hand, invisible
punishments, which only harm and can not take advantage of, no one has to
endure for the sins of others, since God is the judge, just as no one has to
endure, except by his own fault, the visible penalties when the judge is the
man. This is what God has commanded man, who is judge in the things that
pertains to the human judgment to punish, because in his judgment he arrives to
where he does not have pretensions to arrive the human power.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif"><strong>9 (Jos
7,15.25).</strong> We can rightly ask why Joshua ordered the people to stone the
individual who was surprised at having broken the anathema, when the Lord had
commanded that, if it were discovered, he should be handed over to the fire. Or
perhaps it was fitting that he should die, like Joshua, who was closer to the
Lord, could he understand the words of the Lord who commanded him? No other, in
fact, could understand them more easily. Therefore, we must ask why the Lord
calls fire to stoning before thinking that Joshua did something different from
what the Lord sent him. Because there could not be another wiser to understand
the words of the Lord or anyone more obedient than him to fulfill them.
Therefore, the Scripture testifies in Deuteronomy that, under the name of fire,
the punishment could be indicated, when it is said to the children of Israel:
"And I brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt." Here,
evidently, the Scripture wanted to mean a hard tribulation.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Two
reasons occur to me - not because they fit the two, but only one of them - to
say why Akar was not burned with all his things by a visible fire. If the Lord
judged that his sin was of such a nature that, atoned for by that torment, he
would not punish it eternally, the penalty would very appropriately be called
fire by his own atonement and purification. No one would be led to think this
if a fire visible in its own right had burned him. Everyone would rather stop
to think about what they clearly saw done and no one else would ask another
reason. Now, since it is reasonably said that the stoning was also a fire,
because of the words of God and the performance of Joshua, it is elegantly
recognized that man was purified by that punishment, so that he would not
perish later because of that sin In the same way, in Leviticus, the utensils
that are purged by fire are also meant (Cf Lv 13,52)</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But if the
sin was of such a nature that such a man was worthy of gehenna, because of that
sin, even after this life, Joshua would have wanted to stone him precisely to
warn that in what the Lord had said: he will be delivered to the fire (Jos 7,15),
you had to understand not what they did, but what the Lord was going to do.
Well, if the Lord had said: You will give it to the fire with all its things,
there would be no possibility for this sense. But as the sentence is set so
that it seems that God foretold what would happen to the guilty rather than
sending what men should do to him, that is why Joshua, who understood the
divine words as a great prophet and prophetically realized this very thing, He
could not do better than to make him die by stoning instead of burning, so that
in those flames the words of the Lord would not be fulfilled, that he wished
that it be understood that he had said them for another reason.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">And no
problem should arise from the fact that God had predicted that not only the
person, but all his things had to be given to fire. For the Lord said thus: He
will be delivered to the fire with all his things. In all his things his works
can be understood, that, according to God, they should be burned with him, not
as the Apostle says about certain works burned by fire, that he, on the other
hand, will be saved (1Co 3,15), if the sin of this man should be understood in
the sense that he was punished even with eternal fire. The people, by punishing
the guilty, also covered their children and their daughters with stones, with
the cattle and with all the things they had. But Joshua did not do this moved
by a human judgment, but by the prophetic spirit, or by having understood the
words: with all his things, so that he did not even consider the stoning to be
exempt from the children, by also applying the punishment instead of the fire,
or because he wanted to signify his works, that God after the death of the
culprit had to burn with him, not only by means of the other things that he
had, but also by his children.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">But not
for that reason we must think that also their children, after death, were punished
with the torment of the fire of hell for the sin of their father, of whom they
were innocent. Because this death, which awaits us all, even if it comes from
the first sin, because we were born, and therefore we necessarily have to die, (Cf
Rm 5,12) can be useful for some if it accelerates. That is why the following is
read about a person: He was taken so that evil did not change his intelligence
(Sab 4,11). Therefore, it is something that only those who have no iniquity
know the reason for the judgment of God or for the mercy that was applied to
both the sons of this man and those thirty-six warriors, all of whom are alien
to the sin of that man. Man (Cf Rm 9,14) But it is clear that it was also
convenient for the people to investigate with panic what had happened and the
others feared so much more to imitate the action of the former the greater the
fear of human frailty, and that such a great and just hatred of the people it
also gave in those who thought that for the hope of the propagation of the
lineage he would let die for his sin, consumed with him his own descendants.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

city, that is, ambush warriors to stalk enemies, we deduce that those who wage
a just war do not act unjustly. And for that reason, a righteous man should not
think about these matters any more important than making a just war, if it is
lawful for him to do it. Because not everyone is lawful. If war is fair, it
matters little to justice if it wins in open combat or by ambush. Fair wars are
usually called those that come insults, in the event that a nation or a city,
which must be attacked in war, has neglected to avenge what their own have done
wrongfully or to return what has been taken away by means of insults. But
without a doubt it is also just that war that God commands to do, he who has no
iniquity (Cf Rm 9,14) and knows what should be given to each one. In this kind
of war, the head of the army or the people themselves are not so much the
author of the war as the servant of the war.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

impression that they came from a distant land, as they had planned, so that the
Israelites would spare their lives - for the Lord had ordered that no one be
respected by the inhabitants of those lands. to those who entered. Well, in
relation to this, some codices both Greek and Latin say: And taking old sacks
on their shoulders (Jos 9,10 4). Other codices that seem more accurate do not
say: on the shoulders, but: on their asses. The similarity of the word in the
Greek language facilitated the error and that is why the Latin copies also
vary. Indeed, omon and onon do not differ much from each other. But the first
word means "shoulder" and the second "ass". It is more
likely that they are asses, because the Gibeonites said that they had been sent
from their village, which was far away. From this it is deduced that they were
legacies and therefore they could carry the necessary things, certainly in
donkeys and not on shoulders, since there could not be many, and also the
Scripture says that they not only carried sacks, but also wineskins (Cf Jos

9,19).</strong> We can ask why the Hebrews thought that they should keep the oath made
to the Gibeonites, even though the oath was made thinking they had come from a
distant land, as they, lying, had told them. The Gibeonites knew that the
Hebrews would wage war on them if they knew that they lived in that land that
had been promised to them and that they would get it on property if they killed
their inhabitants. The Israelites swore to respect them for having lied saying
that they came from a distant land. But after knowing that they lived there,
where, according to the divine precept, they had to make war on everyone they
met, they did not want to break the oath, and, although they knew they had
lied, they preferred to respect their lives, because of the oath, although They
could naturally tell them that they had sworn an oath, believing that they were
coming from a distant land. Knowing the truth, they should have fulfilled the
Lord's command over them, making war against them as others. God approved this
behavior and did not get angry with the Israelites, who had forgiven them, even
though they had not consulted him about who they were and that is why they were
able to deceive them. Therefore, we can think that very timely feared God in
the midst of his people, although they wanted to deceive men to save his life.
That is why the Lord did not get angry with them when they made the oath or
when they were spared, to do justice to the Gibeonites themselves, as men of his
people, punishing the house of Saul, as the book of the Kings says (Cf 2R
21,1-8). And since the oath was kept, although it had been done in favor of men
who had lied, so that the Israelite decision was inclined to clemency, it did
not displease God. Because if, on the contrary, they had sworn that they would
kill some who believed that they were Gibeonites, that they lived in the
promised land and that they had come to them from distant lands, we should not
think that they should be exterminated because of fulfilling the oath, since by
a feeling of clemency similar to forgiveness, the holy man David, even after
swearing that he would kill Nabal, knowing certainly who he was the one he had
to kill, preferred to forgive him and not fulfill the oath in a more serious matter,
thinking that it pleased God more if he did not do what he had sworn to do,
moved by anger to hurt him, than if he did.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

went up, he and all the people of war with him, all the strong and valiant. And
the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not fear them; for I have delivered them into
your hands; it will not resist before you nor one of them ». They did not
consult the Lord to know if they had to go against them. The Lord announced to
them that they would obtain the victory, they who had spontaneously wanted to
help their people well. Thus he could also say who the Gibeonites were who lied
(Cf Jos 9,15(9)), claiming that they lived far away, even if they had consulted
him about them, in case he had not liked that oath, that he would force those
who submitted to him to be forgiven. They had believed God, whom they had heard

the Jebusites, when they meet to besiege to the Gibeonites, and then the
Gibeonites themselves call them kings of the Amorites, when they send
messengers to Joshua to set them free from the siege. But, as I have seen in
the Hebrew version, on both occasions they are called Amorites, when it is
recorded that the king of the city of Jerusalem was a Jebusite, since that same
city receives the name of Jebus as the capital of that town. , and the
Scripture remembers very many times that there were seven peoples that God
promised to exterminate before his, one of which was that of the Amorites.
Unless it is a general name for all or maybe most of them, so that under that

there could also be one of the seven that were properly called the Amorites,
as, for example, there is a part that receives the proper name of Libya, although

to harden his heart, in the same sense as when speaking of Pharaoh. When God
abandons and the enemy conquers, we should not doubt the least that this
happens precisely because of a divine and mysterious judgment. And the phrase
here has the same meaning as there. But here it is striking that it is said
that their heart hardened to take up arms against Israel, and so the Israelites
had no compassion for them, as if they had had it in case they had not risen up
in arms, being so God had commanded that no one be forgiven, and that if they
forgave the Gibeonites it was because they had pretended that they were coming

during the life of Joshua the Israelites spared the lives of some, subjecting them

chief Joshua, but, when he was old and the war had ceased, he only distributed
some lands to them, so that, when Joshua had ceased the war, they had already
distributed those lands, partly free of enemies, and, in part, conquered in
war. That the Israelites could not overcome certain peoples, because the Lord
determined it, is clearly demonstrated in some texts of the Scriptures.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

Canaanite dwelt in Ephraim unto this day, until Pharaoh king of Egypt went up,
and took the city, and set it on fire, and cut them with the sword unto the
Canaanites, and the Kereites, and the inhabitants of Gazer; and Pharaoh gave it
to his daughter as a dowry. What is said of Pharaoh I do not know if it is
necessary to understand it in a prophetic sense, since it is believed that this
story was written at the time in which those recent events were made. What
great thing could be chosen to be prophetically announced, when the past things
are told and the greater and most necessary future things are silenced?
Therefore, it should be thought rather that the Seventy, who are believed to
have translated with prophetic authority because of the admirable consensus
that existed among them, added this, not as announcing the future, but because
they lived at that time in which they remember what happened. that and they had
read it in the books of the Kings (Cf 1R 4,34). Well, it happened in the time
of the Kings. And this seems to me more credible, because I have seen the
translation made of the Hebrew and I have not found it there. Nor is there what
was said about Jericho, that Hoza, who had rebuilt it, had incurred the curse
pronounced by Joshua. The text reads as follows: And Joshua pronounced this
oath that day: "Cursed be the man that builds and rebuilds that city; He
laid his foundation on his firstborn and placed his doors on his last son.” (Jos
6,26) So far it is in the translation made of Hebrew. On the other hand the
following is not found in it: And so did Hoza, who was of Bethel; In his
first-born Abirón he laid his foundation and in his last saved son for the
second time he placed his doors (1R 16,34). It is clear that the Seventy added
it, that they knew that it had happened thus.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

fell on them and they were made tributary to him. This was already done against
the Lord's command and Joshua still lived. But he was no longer his boss in
those battles because of his old age. That is why it is said that the Lord
hardened the hearts of those who had made a common conspiracy to go to war
against Joshua (Cf Jos 11,20) so that this mercy would not be granted, even
against the command of God (Cf Jos 21,20), if they had not been defeated , and,
being already old Joshua or having died, they will remain to be overcome by the

21,41-43).</strong> The question of knowing how to interpret the following text of the
Scripture is rightly presented, since Israel not only did not exterminate the
people who owned the land of promise until the time of Joshua's death, but it
did not even manage to do so. later, although it did manage to defeat them and
settle in the promised land. The text reads as follows: And the Lord granted to
Israel all the land which he had sworn to give to his fathers. And they
inherited it and lived in it. And the Lord granted them peace in all its
confines, as he had sworn to his fathers. None of their enemies could resist
them. The Lord gave all his enemies in his hands. Not one of all the good
things that the Lord promised to the children of Israel failed. All were
fulfilled. You have to consider all these things carefully. And, first of all,
you have to know the territory of how many nations were promised to the
Israelites. It seems that seven nations are surely mentioned frequently. In the
Exodus we read like this: And the Lord said to Moses: "Go, get up from
here, you and your people that you brought from the land of Egypt, to the land that
I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: To your descendants I will
give it to you. At the same time I will send my angel before you and drive out
the Amorite and the Chaldee and the Perizzite and the Gegeseo and the Eveo and
the Jebusite and the Canaanite.” (Ex 33,1-3) It seems clear, therefore, that
God promised the patriarchs the land of these seven nations. In Deuteronomy it
is written even more clearly: If you approach a city to attack it, you will
propose peace. If you respond with peace and open the doors, all the people who
are in the city will be tributary to you and obey you. But if they do not obey
you and make war, then you will besiege them and the Lord your God will deliver
them into your hands and kill all their males at the edge of the sword. To the
women and to the objects and to all the cattle and all the things that there
are in the city, and all the utensils you will take them as booty. And you
shall eat all the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God gives you. So
you will do to all the cities that are far away from you, that do not belong to
the cities of these nations. But as for these cities whose land the Lord your
God gives you as an inheritance, you will not leave anyone alive, but you will
consecrate them to the anathema: to the Chalth and the Amorite and the
Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Uvean and the Jebusite and the Girgash, as
the Lord your God commanded you. Here, too, it is clear that the land of these
seven nations was promised as an inheritance to the Israelites, who would
possess it, once these peoples were defeated and exterminated.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">As for the
other nations that were farther away, outside the confines of these, the Lord
wanted them to become tributaries of Israel if they did not resist. But if they
opposed it, they too would be slaughtered and exterminated, except for the
cattle and other things that could serve as loot. In another passage of
Deuteronomy this text is also read: And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy
God hath brought thee into the land where thou shalt come in to inherit it, and
have cast out of thy presence many great nations: the numbs and the gergesees
and Amorites and Phoebeeans and Canaanites and Evens and Jebusites, seven
nations greater and more numerous and stronger than you, and when the Lord your
God hands them over to you and you defeat them, you will totally exterminate
them. You shall not make a covenant with them, nor have compassion on them, nor
shall you unite in marriage with them; you shall not give your daughter to her
son or take her daughter for your son, (Dt 7,1-3) etc.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Accordingly,
these and other places in the Scriptures often show that the children of Israel
took possession of the lands of these seven nations in such a way that they did
not inhabit them with those who possessed them, but did so in their place. But
in Genesis the offspring of Abraham are promised not only these seven nations,
but eleven. The text reads as follows: On that day the Lord God signed an
alliance with Abraham, saying: "To your descendants I will give this land
from the river of Egypt to the Rio Grande, the Euphrates River: the Kenites and
the Cenemzei and the Cheloneans and the Kettles and the Pharezites and the
Rephaim and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Aeveans and the Girgashites
and the Jebusites (Gn 15,18-20). The question is resolved by saying that it
preceded this prophecy, according to which, Solomon would extend and expand the
kingdom to those limits. The Scripture says thus about Solomon: And all that
Solomon had set up to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of
his dominion: all the people that were left of the high places and the Amorites
and the Perizzites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, whose descendants
had remained with them in the country, to whom the children of Israel had not
been able to deliver the anathema, Solomon submitted them to tribute to this
day (1R 10,22 9,19-21). This is the rest of the peoples that had to be defeated
and, according to the command of the Lord, totally exterminated; the rest that
Salomón submitted to tribute and that, according to the precept of God, must
certainly exterminate. These peoples, submitted, were under the control of
Israel as tributaries. A little further on it reads: And he ruled over all the
kings, from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the ends of Egypt (1R
10,26 4,21). This is where God's prediction of Abraham in Genesis has been
fulfilled, when he spoke to him and made his promise. From the River it is
understood here from the Euphrates. Well, in those places you can perfectly
understand what Rio Grande is without the need to add your own name. It can not
be here of the Jordan, since the Israelites had already conquered lands, even
before the reign of Solomon, not only on this side, but on the other side of
this river. Then the Scripture, in the book of the Kings, says that the kingdom
of Solomon extended from the Euphrates River, on the eastern side, to the
confines of Egypt, from the western part. Therefore, at that time a territory
greater than that occupied by those seven nations was subject. And for that,
they were then subjected to slavery not seven, but eleven nations.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">What is
said in the books of the Kings: to the ends of Egypt from the river, to
indicate the extension of the kingdom from east to west, this same thing is
said in Genesis, to delimit that kingdom from the west to the east, with these
words: from the river of Egypt to the Rio Grande, the Euphrates River (Gn 15,18).
The river of Egypt, which is the determining limit of the kingdom of Israel
from Egypt, is not the Nile, but another small river, which passes through the
city of Rinocorura, to the east of which the promised land already begins.
Thus, the children of Israel had been commanded that, exterminated and
destroyed these people, they would inhabit the lands of the seven nations and
dominate to the Euphrates River, subjecting and making tributary the other
nations. And even if they had not obeyed God in this, since some of the nations
that had to exterminate were subject to tribute, nevertheless, God fulfilled in
the time of Solomon what he had promised.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Now, how
can what we have committed ourselves to study in the book of Joshua Nave be
true, namely: And the Lord gave Israel all the land which he had sworn to give
to his fathers, and they possessed it? How did Joshua, even when he was still
alive, give them all the land, when they had not even beaten the remains of
those seven nations? What follows: And they possessed it, it is true, because
there they were and there they had settled. What is added next: And the Lord
gave them peace all around, as he had sworn to their fathers, it is true,
because even Joshua still living, the remains of those nations did not move
before them; on the contrary, none of them dared to provoke them with a war in
the territories in which they had been established. That is why it was also
said what comes next: None of all his enemies could resist before them. What is
said next: but the Lord gave into his hands all his enemies, refers to the
enemies who dared to make war. And what is said next: Not one of the good words
that the Lord said to the children of Israel failed; all happened (Jos 21,43-45
(41-43)), it means that, although the Israelites had acted against the Lord's
command, forgiving the lives of some of those seven nations and making them
tributary, they were still intact among those people. Therefore, when it was
said: of all the words it was added: good, because the established curses had
not yet taken place for those who had despised and transgressed the Lord's
command.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">Ultimately,
the following words: The Lord gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give his
parents, they must be understood in the sense that, although there were still
among those nations remains that had to be destroyed and exterminated, and of
the other nations that were up to the Euphrates River, or had to be subdued if
they did not resist, or had to be exterminated if they opposed it, however,
those nations remained in their function, as an occasion for exercise, lest
they, weakened by the carnal affections and desires, could not endure
moderately and healthily a great and sudden prosperity of temporary things and,
proudly, perish more quickly, as will be duly demonstrated elsewhere. They were
granted, then, all the land, because even the part that they had not yet
conquered, had already been granted according to a certain test.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

21,42).</strong> The Scripture says: None of all his enemies resisted before them. We
ask how this can be true, when shortly before it was said of the tribe of Dan
that their enemies were not allowed to go down into the valley and overcame
them in the mountains (Cf Jos 19,48 47). The answer is that here too we can
understand this fact as we explain in discussing the twelve sons of Jacob, that
the Scripture states that they were born in Mesopotamia, when Benjamin was not
born there. Here the eleven tribes are considered as if they were all the
people, in the way that we sufficiently know by other passages of the
Scriptures. But if we look for the reason why this tribe did not get enough
land in the lottery that was made and was bothered by the people who owned that
land, we must admit that the explanation certainly lies in the secret counsel
of God. But, when Jacob blessed his children, he said such things about Dan
that some think that the antichrist (Cf Gn 49,17) will come from this tribe.
Therefore, we are not going to say more things now, since this question could
also be resolved by saying that none of all their enemies resisted before them,
when the tribes waged war all together under the command of a single leader,
before the territories were divided. between the tribes, territories that each
one had to defend on their own.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

close attention to the fact that it is often called "sacrifice of
salvation", because if we accept that Christ is called God's salvation (Le
2,30), we do not see how this word could be understood in the plural. For one
is only our Lord Jesus Christ, (Cf 1Co 8,6) although some may be called Christ
by his grace, as the psalm reads: Do not touch my Christians (Ps. 104,15). But

In relation to what Joshua says about his near death: But I walk the path like
all those who are on earth, in the translation made of the Hebrew it is said: I
enter the road. The word "I travel" (recurro) used by the Seventy is
to be understood in the same sense as it was said to man: until you return to
the land from which you were taken (Gn 3,19), a phrase to be understood
referring to the body. But if we want to refer to the soul, according to
Ecclesiastes: And the spirit returns to God who gave it, (Si 12,7) I do not
believe that it can be said of all men, but only of those who have lived in
such a way that they deserve to return to God, as its owner, who has created
them. This can not be correctly interpreted either by those of whom it is said:
spirit that goes and does not return (Sal 77,39). If this holy man Joshua Nave
had not added: like all those on earth, there would be no problem. For we would
not think about him anything else but what we read that is worthy of him. But,
adding: like all those on earth, it is not surprising that the Latin translator
put recourse (travel), did not mean more than "run through"
(percurro) or "I'm running" ( excurro) if this means the Greek word
aprotréjo. Because everyone "runs through" or "runs" along
the path of life, when they have come to an end. But as this word (recourse)
appears in the passage in which the parents of Rebekah say to the servant of
Abraham: Behold Rebecca; Take it, go running, and be the wife of your master's
son, that's why here I have interpreted this word in that way.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the land of Canaan . Well, it is strange that the Seventy have wanted to put
the whole earth in place of the land of Canaan, unless they have done so by
contemplating the prophecy, in such a way that it is taken more as a thing done
by the divine promise as all certainty was announced in advance what would

they did not send legacies to ask for peace. Therefore, if it had been said:

also boast of their help and mercy, as the author of the psalm understood,
saying: Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no living being will
be just in your presence (Ps. 142,2). The Israelites chose rather to boast of
themselves, thinking that they could serve God without any hindrance, in such a
way that they began then to do what the Apostle said about them: Well, ignoring
the justice of God and wanting to establish their own , they did not submit to
the justice of God (Rm 10,3). Thus, the law was introduced so that the crime
would abound and then grace would abound for Christ the Lord (Cf Rm 5,20.21),

And now separate the foreign gods that are in your midst and turn your hearts
to the Lord God of Israel? We can not think that they still had idols of the
Gentiles among them, since before they have proclaimed the obedience of the
people. But if they had them, after so many threats of the law, would so much
prosperity come upon them, if the Lord took such vengeance on them because one
had stolen something from anathema? Finally, Jacob said this to those who had
gone out with him from Mesopotamia, where the idol worship was such that even
Rachel had stolen the father idols. But after that warning from Jacob, they
delivered the idols they had (Cf Gn 35,2.4). From where it is shown that they
were told that in that way because the one who said it knew they had idols. However,
here, after Josué Nave's warning, nobody delivered anything similar. And yet,
we can not think that Joshua said that without reason. Because Joshua does not
say: And now throw away the foreign gods, if you have any among you, but say
the following, as knowing with certainty that there were: that there is among
you. Therefore, the holy prophet saw that in their hearts there were thoughts
about God alien to God and he ordered them to be discarded. Because whoever
thinks of a God who is not God, leads in his thought to a strange and certainly
false God. Because who can think of God as God is? Therefore, it remains in the
hands of the faithful, while they wander away from the Lord (Cf 2Co 5,6), to
eliminate from their hearts the vain phantoms that are presented to them and
that enter into thought, suggesting that God is of this or the other way, as it
is not actually. And they must faithfully direct the heart to him so that, as
he knows and as soon as he knows what is best for us, he himself insinuates
himself by means of his Spirit, until every lie disappears. That is why it is
said: every man is a liar (Ps.115,2 11). And overcome not only the untruthful
falsehood, but also the mirror and the enigma, we know him face to face, as we
are also known, as the Apostle says: Now we see through a mirror in an enigma;
then, instead, face to face; now I know partially; but then I will know how I
am known (1Co 13,12).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

the law and the judgment in Shiloh before the tabernacle of the Lord God of
Israel. And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God. And Joshua
took a large stone and put it under the terebinth before the Lord. And Joshua
said to the people, "Behold, this stone will be a witness for you, for you
have heard all that the Lord has said, all that he has spoken to you today; it
will be for you a witness in the last days, when you have lied to the Lord your
God ». Those who hear these words, not superficially, but meditate with a
little depth, should not think that such an important man was so foolish that
he believed that an inanimate stone could hear the words that God told his
people. This stone, if it had been reproduced in the image of man by an artist,
would certainly be counted among those of whom it is said in the psalm: They
have ears and do not hear. Indeed, not only do they not hear the idols of the
Gentiles, which are of gold and silver (Ps. 113,14 6), but also those that are
made of stone; rather, by means of this stone it was undoubtedly meant that which
was a stumbling block for unbelieving Jews and a scandalous stone, which, being
rejected by the builders, became the cornerstone (Cf Ps. 113,12 4; 134,15). He
also prefigured that rock which, beaten with the rod, gave drink to the thirsty
people, of which the Apostle says the following: For they drank of the
spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ (Cf Ps. 117,22; 1P
2,7.8). Therefore, this Egregian guide also circumcised the people with stone
knives (1Co 10.4): these knives are also buried with him to show them a
profound profitable mystery for the descendants. Well, this stone, although it
is placed there visibly, must also be taken in a spiritual sense, as a future
witness for the infidel Jews, that is, liars, of whom the psalm says: The
enemies of the Lord lied to him (Cf Jos 5,2.3). And this does not happen
without reason, since already the servant of God, Moses, or rather God through
him, arranged for the people an alliance that was kept in the ark, which was
called the ark of the covenant, and in the books of the law, written with a
great quantity of mysteries and precepts, (Sal 80,16) for here it is also said:
Joshua arranged an alliance for the people that day (Cf Ex 24,3). The
repetition of the covenant means the New Testament. And this also means
Deuteronomy, since Deuteronomy means the second law. And they also mean the new
tables of the law, once the first ones are broken (Jos 24,25). Because it had
to mean in many ways what had to be accomplished in only one way. That the
stone was placed under a terebinto means the same as the rod for the rock, so
that water could come out, because here the rock is not detached from the wood.
And he was underneath precisely because he would not have been exalted on the
cross if he had not submitted with humility, or because at that time when
Joshua Nave was doing this, this mystery still had to be hidden. The wood of
the terebinth distils a medicinal substance, a tree that the Seventy have
mentioned in this place, although according to other translators it is an oak.</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">
</p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif">The fact
that, at least in the last words that Joshua, that man of God, addressed to the
people, did not blame them for having spared the lives of those people whom the
Lord had commanded to destroy totally, delivering them to the anathema. The
text reads as follows: And it came to pass after the children of Israel became
stronger and subjected the Canaanites to bondage; however, they were not
totally exterminated (Cf Ex 34,1.4). The Scripture testifies that, at first,
the Israelites did not succeed. But now, after having become stronger, to the
point of subjecting them to servitude, the fact of not having exterminated
them, certainly, was done against the Lord's precept (Jos 17.13). And this they
did not do with anyone when Joshua was in charge of the army. Why, then, did he
not blame them in his last speech for having been negligent in fulfilling the
Lord's precept in this matter? Perhaps because we must think that, as before
the Scripture says they were not able to destroy them, because they were not
strong enough, nor when they became stronger they could, because they were
afraid that maybe, if they had not wanted to forgive them life, being as they
were prepared to lend them servitude, would force them to fight more fiercely
against them by their own desperation, and then they could not have overcome
them? The Lord did not want to take into account this human fear, although it
shows a certain lack of faith. If they had had a stronger faith, they would
have had the same things that happened to Joshua when he was waging war. But because
they did not have a faith as great as theirs, even when they had become
stronger than their adversaries, fearing the enemies did not dare to fight
against them until the extermination. And this fear, as I said, not from malice
or arrogance or contempt of the Lord's command, but from the weakness of
courage, the Lord did not want to take it into account to present the last
things he said to them through of Joshua. Therefore, the Apostle also says:
Alexander, the blacksmith, has done me much evil; the Lord will repay him
according to his works. About those who left him when he was in danger, not out
of malice, but out of fear, he spoke like this: In my first defense, no one
assisted me, rather they all abandoned me; that they are not taken into account
(2Tm 4,14.16).</span></p><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt">

<p><q>And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you. Be therefore imitators of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230117.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">beloved children</font></u></a>; and walk in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to God for an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230117.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">odor</font></u></a> of a sweet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230117.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">smell</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>The events which are past have greater force than those which are yet to come, and appear to be both more wonderful and more convincing. And hence accordingly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> founds his exhortation upon the things which have already been done for us, inasmuch as they, on Christ's account, have a greater force. For to say, <q>Forgive, and you shall be forgiven</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:14</font></u></a></span>, and <q>if you forgive not, you shall in nowise be forgiven</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:15</font></u></a></span>—this addressed to men of understanding, and men who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> in the things to come, is of great weight; but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> appeals to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a> not by these arguments only, but also by things already done for us. In the former way we may escape punishment, whereas in this latter we may have our share of some positive good. Thou imitatest Christ. This alone is enough to recommend <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, that it is <q>to imitate God.</q> This is a higher principle than the other, <q>for He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and the good, and sends rain on the just and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08010c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">unjust</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse45" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:45</font></u></a></span> Because he does not merely say that we are <q>imitating <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> but that we do so in those things wherein we receive ourselves such benefits. He would have us cherish the tender heart of fathers towards each other. For by heart, here, is meant lovingkindness and compassion. For inasmuch as it cannot be that, being men, we shall avoid either giving pain or suffering it, he does the next thing, he devises a remedy—that we should forgive one another. And yet there is no comparison. For if you indeed should at this moment forgive any one, he will forgive you again in return; whereas to God you have neither given nor forgiven anything. And thou indeed art forgiving a fellow-servant; whereas God is forgiving a servant, and an enemy, and one that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> Him.</p>
<p><q>Even as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>also in Christ forgave you.</q></p>
<p>And this, moreover, contains a high allusion. Not simply, he would say, has He forgiven us, and at no risk or cost, but at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> of His Son; for that He might forgive you, He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a> the Son; whereas thou, oftentimes, even when you see pardon to be both without risk and without cost, yet dost not grant it.</p>
<p><q>Be therefore imitators of God as beloved children; and walk in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11215d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">offering</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</q></p>
<p>That you may not then think it an act of necessity, hear how He says, that <q>He gave Himself up.</q> As your Master loved you, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> thou your friend. Nay, but neither will you be able so to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; yet still do so as far as you are able. Oh, what can be more blessed than a sound like this! Tell me of royalty or whatever else you will, there is no comparison. Forgive another, and you are <q>imitating <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>,</q> you are made like <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. It is more our duty to forgive trespasses than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230117.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">debts</font></u></a> of money; for if you forgive debts, you have not <q>imitated God</q>; whereas if you shall forgive trespasses, you are <q>imitating God.</q> And yet how shall you be able to say, <q>I am poor, and am not able to forgive it,</q> that is, a debt, when you forgive not that which you are able to forgive, that is, a trespass? And surely thou dost not deem that in this case there is any loss. Yea, is it not rather <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, is it not abundance, is it not a plentiful store?</p>
<p>And behold yet another and a nobler incitement: — <q>as beloved children,</q> says he. You have yet another cogent reason to imitate Him, not only in that you have received such good at His hands, but also in that you are called His children. And since not all children imitate their fathers, but those which are beloved, therefore he says, <q>as beloved children.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 2</font></u></a>. <q>Walk in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p>Behold, here, the groundwork of all! So then where this is, there is no <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, no clamor, no railing,</q> but all are done away. Accordingly he puts the chief point last. Whence were you made a child? Because you were forgiven. On the same ground on which you have had so vast a privilege vouch-safed you, on that selfsame ground forgive your neighbor. Tell me, I say, if you were in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12430a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prison</font></u></a>, and had ten thousand misdeeds to answer for, and some one were to bring you into the palace; or rather to pass over this argument, suppose thou were in a fever and in the agonies of death, and some one were to benefit you by some medicine, would you not value him more than all, yea and the very name of the medicine? For if we thus regard occasions and places by which we are benefited, even as our own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, much more shall we the things themselves. Be a lover then of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; for by this are you saved, by this have you been made a son. And if you shall have it in your power to save another, will you not use the same remedy, and give the advice to all, <q>Forgive, that you may be forgiven</q>? Thus to incite one another, were the part of grateful, of generous, and noble spirits.</p>
<p><q>Even as Christ also,</q> he adds, <q>loved you.</q></p>
<p>You are only sparing friends, He enemies. So then far greater is that boon which comes from our Master. For how in our case is the <q>even as</q> preserved. Surely it is clear that it will be, by our doing good to our enemies.</p>
<p><q>And gave Himself up for us an offering and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</q></p>
<p>Do you see that to suffer for one's enemies is <q>a sweet-smelling savor,</q> and an <q>acceptable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a></q>? And if you shall die, then will you be indeed a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>. This it is to <q>imitate God.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 3</font></u></a>. <q>But fornication, and all uncleanness or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, let it not even be named among you, as becomes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>He has spoken of the bitter passion, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>; he now comes to the lesser <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>: for that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> is the lesser <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, hear how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> also in the law says, first, <q>You shall do no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo020.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 20:13</font></u></a></span>, which is the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, and then, <q>You shall not commit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo020.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 20:14</font></u></a></span>, which is of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. For as <q>bitterness,</q> and <q>clamor,</q> and <q>all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a>,</q> and <q>railing,</q> and the like, are the works of the passionate man, so likewise are <q>fornication, uncleanness, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>,</q> those of the lustful; since <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">avarice</font></u></a> and sensuality spring from the same passion. But just as in the former case he took away <q>clamor</q> as being the vehicle of <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>,</q> so now does he <q>filthy talking</q> and <q>jesting</q> as being the vehicle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>; for he proceeds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 4</font></u></a>. <q>Nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting; but rather giving of thanks.</q></p>
<p>Have no witticisms, no obscenities, either in word or in deed, and you will quench the flame— <q>let them not even be named,</q> says he, <q>among you,</q> that is, let them not anywhere even make their appearance. This he says also in writing to the Corinthians. <q>It is actually reported that there is fornication among you</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co005.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 5:1</font></u></a></span>; as much as to say, Be all pure. For words are the way to acts. Then, that he may not appear a forbidding kind of person and austere, and a destroyer of playfulness, he goes on to add the reason, by saying, <q>which are not befitting,</q> which have nothing to do with us— <q>but rather giving of thanks.</q> What good is there in uttering a witticism? thou only raisest a laugh. Tell me, will the shoemaker ever busy himself about anything which does not belong to or <em>befit</em> his trade? Or will he purchase any tool of that kind? No, never. Because the things we do not need, are nothing to us.</p>
<p>Moral. Let there not be one idle word; for from idle words we fall also into foul words. The present is no season of loose merriment, but of mourning, of tribulation, and lamentation: and do you play the jester? What wrestler on entering the ring neglects the struggle with his adversary, and utters witticisms? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> stands hard at hand, <q>he is going about roaring</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1pe005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Peter 5:8</font></u></a></span> to catch you, he is moving everything, and turning everything against your life, and is scheming to force you from your retreat, he is grinding his teeth and bellowing, he is breathing fire against your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>; and do you sit uttering witticisms, and <q>talking folly,</q> and uttering things <q>which are not befitting.</q> Full nobly then will you be able to overcome him! We are in sport, beloved. Would you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the life of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>? Listen to what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says. <q>By the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act020.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 20:31</font></u></a></span> And if so great was the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15753a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">zeal</font></u></a> he exerted in behalf of them of Miletus and Ephesus, not making pleasant speeches, but introducing his admonition with tears, what should one say of the rest? But hearken again to what he says to the Corinthians. <q>Out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co002.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 2:4</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak?</q> <q>Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co011.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 11:29</font></u></a></span> And hearken again to what he says elsewhere, desiring every day, as one might say, to depart out of the world. <q>For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co005.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 5:4</font></u></a></span>; and do you laugh and play? It is war-time, and are you handling the dancers' instruments? Look at the countenances of men in battle, their dark and contracted mien, their brow terrible and full of awe. Mark the stern eye, the heart eager and beating and throbbing, their spirit collected, and trembling and intensely anxious. All is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> order, all is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> discipline, all is silence in the camps of those who are arrayed against each other. They speak not, I do not say, an impertinent word, but they utter not a single sound. Now if they who have visible enemies, and who are in nowise injured by words, yet observe so great silence, do you who hast your warfare, and the chief of your warfare in words, do you leave this part naked and exposed? Or are you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a> that it is here that we are most beset with snares? Are you amusing and enjoying yourself, and uttering witticisms and raising a laugh, and regarding the matter as a mere nothing? How many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjuries</font></u></a>, how many injuries, how many filthy speeches have arisen from witticisms! <q>But no,</q> you will say, <q>pleasantries are not like this.</q> Yet hear how he excludes all kinds of jesting. It is a time now of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> and fighting, of watch and guard, of arming and arraying ourselves. The time of laughter can have no place here; for that is of the world. Hear what Christ says: <q>The world shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a>, but you shall be sorrowful.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 16:20</font></u></a></span> Christ was crucified for your ills, and do you laugh? He was buffeted, and endured so great sufferings because of your calamity, and the tempest that had overtaken you; and do you play the reveler? And how will you not then rather provoke Him?</p>
<p>But since the matter appears to some to be one of indifference, which moreover is difficult to be guarded against, let us discuss this point a little, to show you how vast an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> it is. For indeed this is a work of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, to make us disregard things indifferent. First of all then, even if it were indifferent, not even in that case were it right to disregard it, when one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> that the greatest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> are both produced and increased by it, and that it oftentimes terminates in fornication. However, that it is not even indifferent is evident from hence. Let us see then whence it is produced. Or rather, let us see what sort of a person a saint ought to be:— gentle, meek, sorrowful, mournful, contrite. The man then who deals in jests is no saint. Nay, were he even a Greek, such an one would be scorned. These are things allowed to those only who are on the stage. Where filthiness is, there also is jesting; where unseasonable laughter is, there also is jesting. Hearken to what the Prophet says, <q>Serve the Lord in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> with trembling.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa002.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 2:11</font></u></a></span> Jesting renders the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> soft and indolent. It excites the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> unduly, and often it teems with acts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, and creates <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a>. But what more? In fine, have you not come to be among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>? Then <q>put away childish things.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co013.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 13:11</font></u></a></span> Why, you will not allow your own servant in the market place to speak an impertinent word: and do you then, who sayest you are a servant of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, go uttering your witticisms in the public square? It is well if the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that is <q>sober</q> be not stolen away; but one that is relaxed and dissolute, who cannot carry off? It will be its own murderer, and will stand in no need of the crafts or assaults of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>But, moreover, in order to understand this, look too at the very name. It means the versatile man, the man of all complexions, the unstable, the pliable, the man that can be anything and everything. But far is this from those who are servants to the Rock. Such a character quickly turns and changes; for he must needs mimic both gesture and speech, and laugh and gait, and everything, aye, and such an one is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11189a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obliged</font></u></a> to invent jokes: for he needs this also. But far be this from a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, to play the buffoon. Farther, the man who plays the jester must of necessity incur the signal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> of the objects of his random ridicule, whether they be present, or being absent hear of it.</p>
<p>If the thing is creditable, why is it left to mountebanks? What, do you make yourself a mountebank, and yet art not ashamed? Why is it ye permit not your gentlewomen to do so? Is it not that you set it down as a mark of an immodest, and not of a discreet character? Great are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> that dwell in a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> given to jesting; great is the ruin and desolation. Its consistency is broken, the building is decayed, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> is banished, reverence is gone. A tongue you have, not that you may ridicule another man, but that you may give thanks unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Look at your merriment-makers, as they are called, those buffoons. These are your jesters. Banish from your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, I entreat you, this graceless accomplishment. It is the business of parasites, of mountebanks, of dancers, of harlots; far be it from a generous, far be it from a highborn <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, aye, far too even from slaves. If there be any one who has lost respect, if there be any vile person, that man is also a jester. To many indeed the thing appears to be even a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, and this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> calls for our sorrow. Just as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a> little by little drives headlong into fornication, so also does a turn for jesting. It seems to have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> about it, yet there is nothing more graceless than this. For hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> which says, <q>Before the thunder goes lightning, and before a shamefaced man shall go favor.</q> Now there is nothing more shameless than the jester; so that his mouth is not full of favor, but of pain. Let us banish this custom from our tables. Yet are there some who teach it even to the poor! O monstrous! They make men in affliction play the jester. Why, where shall not this pest be found next? Already has it been brought into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> itself. Already has it laid hold of the very Scriptures. Need I say anything to prove the enormity of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>? I am ashamed indeed, but still nevertheless I will speak; for I am desirous to show to what a length the mischief has advanced, that I may not appear to be trifling, or to be discoursing to you on some trifling subject; that even thus I may be enabled to withdraw you from this delusion. And let no one think that I am fabricating, but I will tell you what I have really heard. A certain person happened to be in company with one of those who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> themselves highly on their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> (now I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> I shall excite a smile, but still I will say it notwithstanding); and when the platter was set before him, he said, <q>Take and eat, children, lest your belly be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>!</q> And again, others say, <q>Woe unto you, Mammon, and to him that has you not;</q> and many like enormities has jesting introduced; as when they say, <q>Now is there no nativity.</q> And this I say to show the enormity of this base temper; for these are the expressions of a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> destitute of all reverence. And are not these things enough to call down thunderbolts? And one might find many other such things which have been said by these men.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I entreat you, let us banish the custom universally, and speak those things which become us. Let not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> mouths utter the words of dishonorable and base men. <q>For what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity, or what communion has light with darkness?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co006.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 6:14</font></u></a></span> Happy will it be for us, if, having kept ourselves aloof from all such foul things, we be thus able to attain to the promised blessings; far indeed from dragging such a train after us, and sullying the purity of our minds by so many. For the man who will play the jester will soon go on to be a railer, and the railer will go on to heap ten thousand other mischiefs on himself. When then we shall have disciplined these two faculties of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> and desire (vid. Plat. Phædr. cc. 25, 34), and have put them like well-broken horses under the yoke of reason, then let us set over them the mind as charioteer, that we may <q>gain the prize of our high calling</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:14</font></u></a></span>; which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant that we may all attain, through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> our Lord, with Whom, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now, and ever, and throughout all ages. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ephesians 5:5, 6 </p>
<p><q>For this ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things comes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> of God upon the sons of disobedience.</q></p>
<p>There were, it is likely, in the time of our forefathers also, some who <q>weakened the hands of the people</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jer038.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jeremiah 38:4</font></u></a></span>, and brought into practice that which is mentioned by Ezekiel,— or rather who did the works of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">false prophets</font></u></a>, who <q>profaned God among His people for handfuls of barley</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze013.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 13:19</font></u></a></span>; a thing, by the way, done methinks by some even at this day. When, for example, we say that he who calls his brother a fool shall depart into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell-fire</font></u></a>, others say, <q>What? Is he that calls his brother a fool to depart into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell-fire</font></u></a>? Impossible,</q> say they. And again, when we say that <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man is an idolater,</q> in this too again they make abatements, and say the expression is hyperbolical. And in this manner they underrate and explain away all the commandments. It was in allusion then to these that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessed Paul</font></u></a>, at this time when he wrote to the Ephesians, spoke thus, <q>For this ye <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God</q>; adding, <q>let no man deceive you with empty words.</q> Now <q>empty words</q> are those which for a while are gratifying, but are in nowise borne out in facts; because the whole case is a deception.</p>
<p><q>Because of these things comes the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> of God upon the sons of disobedience.</q></p>
<p>Because of <q>fornication,</q> he means, because of <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>,</q> because of <q>uncleanness,</q> or both because of these things, and because of the <q>deceit,</q> inasmuch as there are deceivers. <q>Sons of disobedience</q>; he thus calls those who are utterly disobedient, those who disobey Him.</p>
<p>Ver. 7, 8. <q>Be not ye, therefore, partakers with them. For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord.</q></p>
<p>Observe how wisely he urges them forward; first, from the thought of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> one another, and do <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">injury</font></u></a> to no man; then, on the other hand, from the thought of punishment and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell-fire</font></u></a>. <q>For you were once darkness,</q> says he, <q>but are now light in the Lord.</q> Which is what he says also in the Epistle to the Romans; <q>What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof you are now ashamed?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom006.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 6:21</font></u></a></span>, and reminds them of their former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. That is to say, thinking what ye once were, and what you are now become, do not run back into your former <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, nor do <q>despite to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a></q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb010.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 10:29</font></u></a></span> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>You were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord!</q></p>
<p>Not, he says, by your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> of God has this accrued to you. That is to say, you also were sometime worthy of the same punishments, but now are so no more. <q>Walk</q> therefore <q>as children of light.</q> What is meant however by <q>children of light,</q> he adds afterwards.</p>
<p>Ver. 9, 10. <q>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord.</q></p>
<p><q>In all goodness,</q> he says: this is opposed to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, and the bitter: <q>and righteousness</q>; this to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a>: <q>and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a></q>; this to false pleasure: not those former things, he says, which I was mentioning, but their opposites. <q>In all</q>; that is, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fruit</font></u></a> of the Spirit ought to be evinced in everything. <q>Proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord</q>; so that those things are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">tokens</font></u></a> of a childish and imperfect mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 11, 12, 13</font></u></a>. <q>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them. For the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. But all things when they are reproved, are made manifest by the light.</q></p>
<p>He had said, <q>you are light.</q> Now the light reproves by exposing the things which take place in the darkness. So that if you, says he, are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, and conspicuous, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> will be unable to lie hidden. For just as when a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230118.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">candle</font></u></a> is set, all are brought to light, and the thief cannot enter; so if your light shine, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a> being discovered shall be caught. So then it is our duty to expose them. How then does our Lord say, <q>Judge not, that you be not judged</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:1-3</font></u></a></span> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> did not say <q>judge,</q> he said <q>reprove,</q> that is, correct. And the words, <q>Judge not, that you be not judged,</q> He spoke with reference to very small <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">errors</font></u></a>. Indeed, He added, <q>Why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?</q> But what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> is saying is of this sort. As a wound, so long as it is imbedded and concealed outwardly, and runs beneath the surface, receives no attention, so also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, as long as it is concealed, being as it were in darkness, is daringly committed in full security; but as soon as <q>it is made manifest,</q> becomes <q>light</q>; not indeed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> itself, (for how could that be?) but the sinner. For when he has been brought out to light, when he has been admonished, when he has repented, when he has obtained pardon, have you not cleared away all his darkness? Have you not then healed his wound? Have you not called his unfruitfulness into fruit? Either this is his meaning, or else what I said above, that your life <q>being manifest, is light.</q> For no one hides an irreproachable life; whereas things which are hidden, are hidden by darkness covering them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 14</font></u></a>. <q>Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon you.</q></p>
<p>By the <q>sleeper</q> and the <q>dead,</q> he means the man that is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; for he both exhales noisome odors like the dead, and is inactive like one that is asleep, and like him he sees nothing, but is dreaming, and forming fancies and illusions. Some indeed read, <q>And you shall touch Christ</q>; but others, <q>And Christ shall shine upon you</q>; and it is rather this latter. Depart from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, and you shall be able to behold Christ. <q>For every one that does ill, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hates</font></u></a> the light, and comes not to the light.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh003.htm#verse20" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 3:20</font></u></a></span> He therefore that does it not, comes to the light.</p>
<p>Now he is not saying this with reference to the unbelievers only, for many of the faithful, no less than unbelievers, hold fast by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>; nay, some far more. Therefore to these also it is necessary to exclaim, <q>Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon you.</q> To these it is fitting to say this also, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of the dead, but of the living.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat022.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 22:32</font></u></a></span> If then he is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of the dead, let us live.</p>
<p>Now there are some who say that the words, <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man is an idolater,</q> are hyperbolical. However, the statement is not hyperbolical, it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a>. How, and in what way? Because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man apostatizes from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, just as the idolater does. And lest you should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> this is a bare assertion, there is a declaration of Christ which says, <q>You cannot serve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mammon</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:24</font></u></a></span> If then it is not possible to serve <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Mammon</font></u></a>, they who serve Mammon have thrown themselves out of the service of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; and they who have denied His sovereignty, and serve lifeless gold, it is plain enough that they are idolaters. <q>But I never made an idol,</q> a man will say, <q>nor set up an altar, nor <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a> sheep, nor poured libations of wine; no, I came into the church, and lifted up my hands to the Only-begotten <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son of God</font></u></a>; I partake of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, I communicate in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, and in everything else which is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian's</font></u></a> duty. How then,</q> he will say, <q>am I a worshiper of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>?</q> Yes, and this is the very thing which is the most astonishing of all, that when you have had experience, and hast <q>tasted</q> the lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and <q>hast seen that the Lord is gracious</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa033.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 34:8</font></u></a></span>, you should abandon Him who is gracious, and take to yourself a cruel tyrant, and should pretend to be serving Him, while in reality you have submitted yourself to the hard and galling yoke of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. You have not yet told me of your own duty done, but only of your Master's gifts. For tell me, I beseech you, whence do we judge of a soldier? Is it when he is on duty guarding the king, and is fed by him, and called the king's own, or is it when he is minding his own affairs and interests? To pretend to be with him, and to be attentive to his interests, while he is advancing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of the enemy, we declare to be worse than if he breaks away from the king's service, and joins the enemy. Now then you are doing despite to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, just as an idolater does, not with your own mouth singly, but with the ten thousands of those whom you have wronged. Yet you will say, <q>an idolater he is not.</q> But surely, whenever they say, <q>Oh! That <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christian</font></u></a>, that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> fellow,</q> then not only is he himself committing outrage by his own act, but he frequently forces those also whom he has wronged to use these words; and if they use them not, this is to be set to the account of their reverence.</p>
<p>Do we not see that such is the fact? What else is an idolater? Or does not he too worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, oftentimes not mastering his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>? I mean, for example, when we say that the pagan idolater worships <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, he will say, <q>No, but it is Venus, or it is Mars.</q> And if we say, Who is this Venus? The more modest among them will say, It is pleasure. Or what is this Mars? It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. And in the same way do you worship Mammon. If we say, Who is this Mammon? It is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, and this you are worshiping. <q>I worship it not,</q> you will say. Why not? Because thou dost not bow yourself down? Nay, but as it is, you are far more a worshiper in your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and practices; for this is the higher kind of worship. And that you may understand this, look in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; who more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> worship Him, they who merely stand up at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, or they who do His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>? Clearly enough, these latter. The same also is it with the worshipers of Mammon; they who do his will, they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a> are his worshipers. However, they who worship the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a> are oftentimes free from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>. One may see a worshiper of Mars oftentimes governing his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>. But this is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> of you; you make yourself a slave to your passion.</p>
<p>Yes, but you slay no sheep? No, you slay men, reasonable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, some by famine, others by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemies</font></u></a>. Nothing can be more frenzied than a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> like this. Who ever beheld <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>? How accursed is the altar of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>! When you pass by this idol's altar here, you shall see it reeking with the blood of bullocks and goats; but when you shall pass by the altar of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, you shall see it breathing the shocking odor of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> blood. Stand here before it in this world, and you shall see, not the wings of birds burning, no vapor, no smoke exhaled, but the bodies of men perishing. For some throw themselves among precipices, others tie the halter, others thrust the dagger through their throat. Have you seen the cruel and inhuman <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a>? Would you see yet more shocking ones than these? Then I will show you no longer the bodies of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of men slaughtered in the other world. Yes, for it is possible for a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> to be slain with the slaughter peculiar to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>; for as there is a death of the body, so is there also of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. <q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>,</q> says the Prophet, <q>it shall die.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eze018.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ezekiel 18:4</font></u></a></span> The death of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, however, is not like the death of the body; it is far more shocking. For this bodily death, separating the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> and the body the one from the other, releases the one from many anxieties and toils, and transmits the other into a manifest abode: then when the body has been in time dissolved and crumbled away, it is again gathered together in incorruption, and receives back its own proper <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Such we see is this bodily death. But that of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> is awful and terrific. For this death, when dissolution takes place, does not let it pass, as the body does, but binds it down again to an imperishable body, and consigns it to the unquenchable fire. This then is the death of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. And as therefore there is a death of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, so is there also a slaughter of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. What is the slaughter of the body? It is the being turned into a corpse, the being stripped of the energy derived from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. What is the slaughter of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? It is its being made a corpse also. And how is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> made a corpse? Because as the body then becomes a corpse when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> leaves it destitute of its own vital energy, so also does the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> then become a corpse, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> leaves it destitute of His spiritual energy.</p>
<p>Such for the most part are the slaughters made at the altar of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. They are not satisfied, they do not stop at men's blood; no, the altar of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> is not glutted, unless it <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> itself also, unless it receive the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> of both, the sacrificer and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>. For he who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> must first be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>, and then he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a>; and the dead <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> him who is yet living. For when he utters <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blasphemies</font></u></a>, when he reviles, when he is irritated, are not these so many incurable wounds of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>?</p>
<p>You have seen that the expression is no hyperbole. Would you hear again another argument, to teach you how <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>, and more shocking than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>? Idolaters worship the creatures of God (<q>for they worshipped,</q> it is said, <q>and served the creature rather than the Creator</q>) <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom001.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 1:25</font></u></a></span>; but you are worshiping a creature of your own. For God made not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> but your own insatiable appetite invented it. And look at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and folly. They that worship <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a> they worship; and if any one speak of them with disrespect or ridicule, they stand up in their defense; whereas thou, as if in a sort of intoxication, art worshiping an object, which is so far from being free from accusation, that it is even full of impiety. So that thou, even more than they, excellest in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>. You can never have it to say as an excuse, that it is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. If even they are in the highest degree without excuse, yet are you in a far higher, who art forever censuring <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, and reviling those who devote themselves to it, and who yet does serve and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> it.</p>
<p>We will examine, if you please, whence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a> took its rise. A certain wise man <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/wis014.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Wisdom 14:16</font></u></a></span> tells us, that a certain rich man afflicted with untimely mourning for his son, and having no consolation for his sorrow, consoled his passion in this way: having made a lifeless image of the dead, and constantly gazing at it, he seemed through the image to have his departed one still; while certain flatterers, <q>whose God was their belly</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi003.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 3:19</font></u></a></span>, treating the image with reverence in order to do him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, carried on the custom into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>. So then it took its rise from weakness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, from a senseless custom, from extravagance. But not so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>: from weakness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> indeed it is, only that it is from a worse weakness. It is not that any one has lost a son, nor that he is seeking for consolation in sorrow, nor that he is drawn on by flatterers. But how is it? I will tell you. Cain in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> overreached <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>; what ought to have been given to Him, he kept to himself; what he should have kept himself, this he offered to Him; and thus the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> began even from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. For if we are God's, much more are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06082a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">first-fruits</font></u></a> of our possessions. Again, men's violent passion for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a> arose from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>. <q>They saw the daughters of men</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen006.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 6:2</font></u></a></span>, and they rushed headlong into <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. And from hence again it went on to money; for the wish to have more than one's neighbor of this world's goods, arises from no other source, than from <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> waxing cold.</q> The wish to have more than one's share arises from no other source than recklessness, misanthropy, and arrogance toward others. Look at the earth, how wide is its extent? How far greater than we can use the expanse of the sky and the heaven? It is that He might put an end to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, that God has thus widely extended the bounds of the creation. And are you then still grasping and even thus? And do you hear that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>, and not shudder even at this? Do you wish to inherit the earth? Then have you no inheritance in heaven. Are you eager to leave an inheritance to others, that you may rob yourself of it? Tell me, if any one were to offer you power to possess all things, would you be unwilling? It is in your power now, if you will. Some, however, say, that they are grieved when they transmit the inheritance to others, and would fain have consumed it themselves, rather than see others become its masters. Nor do I acquit you of this weakness; for this too is characteristic of a weak <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. However, at least let as much as this be done. In your will leave Christ your heir. It were your duty indeed to do so in your lifetime, for this would show a right disposition. Still, at all events, be a little generous, though it be but by necessity. For Christ indeed charged us to give to the poor with this object, to make us wise in our lifetime, to induce us to despise money, to teach us to look down upon earthly things. It is no contempt of money, as you think, to bestow it upon this man and upon that man when one dies, and is no longer master of it. You are then no longer giving of your own, but of absolute necessity: thanks to death, not to you. This is no act of affection, it is your loss. However, let it be done even thus; at least then give up your passion.</p>
<p>Moral. Consider how many acts of plunder, how many acts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, you have committed. Restore all fourfold. Thus plead your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Some, however, there are who are arrived at such a pitch of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08041a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">madness</font></u></a> and blindness, as not even then to comprehend their duty; but who go on acting in all cases, just as if they were taking pains to make the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08549a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">judgment of God</font></u></a> yet heavier to themselves. This is the reason why our blessed Apostle writes and says, <q>Walk as children of light.</q> Now the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetous</font></u></a> man of all others lives in darkness, and spreads great darkness over all things around.</p>
<p><q>And have no fellowship,</q> he adds, <q>with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; for the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of; but all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.</q> Hearken, I entreat you, all, as many of you as like not to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> for nothing, but to be loved. <q>What need is there to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>?</q> one says. A man commits a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbery</font></u></a>, and do you not reprove him, but art afraid of his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>? Though this, however, is not being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> for nothing. But do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a> convict him, and yet <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>? Convict your brother, incur enmity for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love's</font></u></a> sake which you owe to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love's</font></u></a> sake which you owe to your brother. Arrest him as he is on his road to the pit of destruction. For to admit him to our table, to treat him with civil speeches, with salutations, and with entertainments, these are no signal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proofs</font></u></a> of friendship. No, those I have mentioned are the boons which we must bestow upon our friends, that we may rescue their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. When we see them lying prostrate in the furnace of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wickedness</font></u></a>, let us raise them up. <q>But,</q> they say, <q>it is of no use, he is incorrigible.</q> However, do thou your duty, and then you have excused yourself to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Hide not your talent. It is for this that you have speech, it is for this you have a mouth and a tongue, that you may correct your neighbor. It is dumb and reasonless creatures only that have no care for their neighbor, and take no account of others. But do you while calling <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>Father,</q> and your neighbor, <q>brother,</q> when you see him committing unnumbered wickednesses, do you prefer his good-will to his welfare? No, do not so, I entreat you. There is no evidence of friendship so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> as never to overlook the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> of our brethren. Did you see them at enmity? Reconcile them. Did you see them guilty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>? Check them. Did you see them wronged? Stand up in their defense. It is not on them, it is on yourself you are conferring the chief benefit. It is for this we are friends, that we may be of use one to another. A man will listen in a different spirit to a friend, and to any other chance person. A chance person he will regard perhaps with suspicion, and so in like manner will he a teacher, but not so a friend.</p>
<p><q>For,</q> he says, <q>the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of: but all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.</q> What is it he means to say here? He means this. That some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> in this world are done in secret, and some also openly; but in the other it shall not be so. Now there is no one who is not conscious to himself of some <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>. This is why he says, <q>But all the things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.</q> What then? Is this again, it will be said, meant concerning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idolatry</font></u></a>? It is not; the argument is about our life and our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. <q>For everything that is made manifest,</q> says he, <q>is light.</q></p>
<p>Wherefore, I entreat you, be ye never backward to reprove, nor displeased at being reproved. For as long indeed as anything is carried on in the dark, it is carried on with greater security; but when it has many to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a> what is done, it is brought to light. By all means then let us do all we can to chase away the deadness which is in our brethren, to scatter the darkness, and to attract to us the <q>Sun of righteousness.</q> For if there be many shining lights, the path of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> will be easy to themselves, and they which are in darkness will be more easily detected, while the light is held forth and puts the darkness to flight. Whereas if it be the reverse, there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> lest as the thick mist of darkness and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> overpowers the light, and dispels its transparency, those shining lights themselves should be extinguished. Let us be then disposed to benefit one another, that one and all, we may offer up praise and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of lovingkindness, by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of the only begotten Son with whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, strength, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> now and forever and forever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ephesians 5:15, 16, 17 </p>
<p><q>Look then carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the Lord is.</q></p>
<p>He is still cleansing away the root of bitterness, still cutting off the very groundwork of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>. For what is he saying? <q>Look carefully how ye walk.</q> <q>They are sheep in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230119.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">midst of wolves</font></u></a>,</q> and he charges them to be also <q>as doves.</q> For <q>you shall be harmless,</q> says he, <q>as doves.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:16</font></u></a></span> Forasmuch then as they were both among wolves, and were besides commanded not to defend themselves, but to suffer <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, they needed this admonition. Not indeed but that the former was sufficient to render them stronger; but now that there is besides the addition of the two, reflect how exceedingly it is heightened. Observe then here also, how carefully he secures them, by saying, <q>Look how ye walk.</q> Whole cities were at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> with them; yea, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> made its way also into houses. They were divided, father against son, and son against father, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230119.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_1_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mother</font></u></a> against daughter, and daughter against mother. What then? Whence these divisions? They heard Christ say, <q>He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:37</font></u></a></span> Lest therefore they should think that he was without reason introducing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wars</font></u></a> and fightings, (since there was likely to be much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> produced, if they on their part were to retaliate,) to prevent this, he says, <q>See carefully how ye walk.</q> That is to say, <q>Except the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> message, give no other handle on any score whatever, for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> which you will incur.</q> Let this be the only ground of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a>. Let no one have any other charge to make against you; but show all deference and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>, whenever it does no harm to the message, whenever it does not stand in the way of godliness. For it is said, <q>Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute, custom to whom custom.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom013.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 13:7</font></u></a></span> For when among the rest of the world they shall see us forbearing, they will be put to shame.</p>
<p><q>Not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time.</q></p>
<p>It is not from any wish that you should be artful, and versatile, that he gives this advice. But what he means is this. The time is not yours. At present you are strangers, and sojourners, and foreigners, and aliens; seek not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honors</font></u></a>, seek not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, seek not authority, nor revenge; bear all things, and in this way, <q>redeem the time</q>; give up many things, anything they may require. Imagine now, I say, a man had a magnificent house, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> were to make their way in, on purpose to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a> him, and he were to give a large sum, and thus to rescue himself. Then we should say, he has redeemed himself. So also have you a large house, and a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> in your keeping. They will come to take all away. Give whatever they may demand, only preserve the principal thing, I mean the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>Because the days,</q> says he, <q>are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of the day? The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of the day ought to belong to the day. What is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of a body? Disease. And what again the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? Wickedness. What is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of water? Bitterness. And the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> of each particular thing, is with reference to that nature of it which is affected by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. If then there is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> in the day, it ought to belong to the day, to the hours, to the day-light. So also Christ says, <q>Sufficient unto the day is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> thereof.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:34</font></u></a></span> And from this expression we shall understand the other. In what sense then does he call <q>the days <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a></q>? In what sense the <q>time</q> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>? It is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">essence</font></u></a> of the thing, not the things as so created, but it is the things transacted in them. In the same way as we are in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07099b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">habit</font></u></a> of saying, <q>I have passed a disagreeable and wretched day.</q> And yet how could it be disagreeable, except from the circumstances which took place in it? Now the events which take place in it are, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> things from bad men. So then of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> which happen in the times, men are the creators, and hence it is that the times are said to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. And thus we also call the times <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230119.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver</font></u></a>. 17, 18. <q>Wherefore,</q> he adds, <q>be ye not foolish, but understand what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the Lord is; and be not drunk with wine, wherein is riot.</q></p>
<p>For indeed intemperance in this renders men passionate and violent, and hot-headed, and irritable and savage. Wine has been given us for cheerfulness, not for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>. Whereas now it appears to be an unmanly and contemptible thing for a man not to get drunk. And what sort of hope then is there of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? What? Contemptible, tell me, not to get drunk, where to get drunk ought of all things in the world to be most contemptible? For it is of all things right for even a private individual to keep himself far from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>; but how much more so for a soldier, a man who lives among swords, and bloodshed, and slaughter: much more, I say, for the soldier, when his temper is sharpened by other causes also, by power, by authority, by being constantly in the midst of stratagems and battles. Would you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> where wine is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a>? Hear what the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says, <q>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro031.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Proverbs 31:6</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">justly</font></u></a>, because it can mitigate asperity and gloominess, and drive away clouds from the brow. <q>Wine makes glad the heart of man</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa103.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 104:15</font></u></a></span>, says the Psalmist. How then does wine produce <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a>? For it cannot be that one and the same thing should work opposite effects. Drunkenness then surely does not arise from wine, but from intemperance. Wine is bestowed upon us for no other purpose than for bodily health; but this purpose also is thwarted by immoderate use. But hear moreover what our blessed Apostle writes and says to Timothy, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities.</q> </p>
<p>This is the reason why God has formed our bodies in moderate proportions, and so as to be satisfied with a little, from thence at once instructing us that He has made us adapted to another life. And that life He would fain have bestowed upon us even from the very beginning; but since we rendered ourselves unworthy of it, He deferred it; and in the time during which He deferred it, not even in that does He allow us immoderate indulgence; for a little cup of wine and a single loaf is enough to satisfy a man's hunger. And man the lord of all the brute creation has He formed so as to require less food in proportion than they, and his body small; thereby declaring to us nothing else than this, that we are hastening onward to another life. <q>Be not drunk,</q> says he, <q>with wine, wherein is riot</q>; for it does not save but it destroys; and that, not the body only, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> also.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 18, 19, 20, 21</font></u></a>. <q>But be filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>; speaking one to another in psalms and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hymns</font></u></a> and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a> to God even the Father; subjecting yourselves one to another in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Do you wish, he says, to be cheerful, do you wish to employ the day? I give you spiritual drink; for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01274a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">drunkenness</font></u></a> even cuts off the articulate sound of our tongue; it makes us lisp and stammer, and distorts the eyes, and the whole frame together. Learn to sing psalms, and you shall see the delightfulness of the employment. For they who sing psalms are filled with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, as they who sing satanic songs are filled with an unclean spirit.</p>
<p>What is meant by <q>with your hearts to the Lord</q>? It means, with close attention and understanding. For they who do not attend closely, merely sing, uttering the words, while their heart is roaming elsewhere.</p>
<p><q>Always,</q> he says, <q>giving thanks for all things in the name of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a> unto God even the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, subjecting yourselves one to another in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>That is, <q>let your requests be made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, with thanksgiving</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/phi004.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Philippians 4:6</font></u></a></span>; for there is nothing so pleasing to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as for a man to be thankful. But we shall be best able to give thanks unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, by withdrawing our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> from the things before mentioned, and by thoroughly cleansing them by the means he has told us.</p>
<p><q>But be filled,</q> says he, <q>with the Spirit.</q></p>
<p>And is then this Spirit within us? Yes, indeed, within us. For when we have driven away lying, and bitterness, and fornication, and uncleanness, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">covetousness</font></u></a>, from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, when we have become kind, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, when there is no jesting, when we have rendered ourselves worthy of it, what is there to hinder the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> from coming and lighting upon us? And not only will He come unto us, but He will fill our hearts; and when we have so great a light kindled within us, then will the way of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> be no longer difficult to attain, but will be easy and simple.</p>
<p><q>Giving thanks always,</q> he says, <q>for all things.</q></p>
<p>What then? Are we to give thanks for everything that befalls us? Yes; be it even disease, be it even penury. For if a certain wise man gave this advice in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14526a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Old Testament</font></u></a>, and said, <q>Whatsoever is brought upon you take cheerfully, and be patient when you are changed to a low estate</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir002.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 2:4</font></u></a></span>; much more ought this to be the case in the New. Yes, even though thou <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not the word, give thanks. For this is thanksgiving. But if you give thanks when you are in comfort and in affluence, in success and in prosperity, there is nothing great, nothing wonderful in that. What is required is, for a man to give thanks when he is in afflictions, in anguish, in discouragements. Utter no word in preference to this, <q>Lord, I thank you.</q> And why do I speak of the afflictions of this world? It is our duty to give God thanks, even for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> itself, for the torments and punishments of the next world. For surely it is a thing beneficial to those who attend to it, when the dread of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> is laid like a bridle on our hearts. Let us therefore give thanks not only for blessings which we see, but also for those which we see not, and for those which we receive against our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>. For many are the blessings He bestows upon us, without our desire, without our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>. And if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> me not, I will at once proceed to make the case clear to you. For consider, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, do not the impious and unbelieving <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a> ascribe everything to the sun and to their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07636a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">idols</font></u></a>? But what then? Does He not bestow blessings even upon them? Is it not the work of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, that they both have life, and health, and children, and the like? And again they that are called Marcionites, and the Manichees, do they not even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02595a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blaspheme</font></u></a> Him? But what then? Does He not bestow blessings on them every day? Now if He bestows blessings on them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> them not, much more does he bestow them upon us. For what else is the peculiar work of God if it be not this, to do good to all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>, alike by chastisements and by enjoyments? Let us not then give thanks only when we are in prosperity, for there is nothing great in this. And this the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a> also well <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>, and therefore he said, <q>Does Job <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> God for nought? Have You not made an hedge about him and about all that he has on every side? Touch all that he has; no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a>, he will renounce You to Your face!</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/job001.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Job 1:10-11</font></u></a></span> However, that cursed one gained no advantage; and God forbid he should gain any advantage of us either; but whenever we are either in penury, or in sicknesses, or in disasters, then let us increase our thanksgiving; thanksgiving, I mean, not in words, nor in tongue, but in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01115a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">deeds</font></u></a> and works, in mind and in heart. Let us give thanks unto Him with all our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. For He loves us more than our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a>; and wide as is the difference between <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> and goodness, so great is the difference between the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> and that of our fathers. And these are not my words, but those of Christ Himself Who loves us. And hear what He Himself says, <q>What man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone? If you then, being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a> give <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things to them that ask Him?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:9-11</font></u></a></span> And again, bear what He says also elsewhere: <q>Can a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget you, says the Lord.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa049.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 49:15</font></u></a></span> For if He loves us not, wherefore did He create us? Had He any necessity? Do we supply to Him any ministry and service? Needs He anything that we can render? Hear what the Prophet says; <q>I have said unto the Lord, You are my Lord, I have no good beyond You.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa015.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 16:2</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>The ungrateful, however, and unfeeling say, that this were worthy of God's goodness, that there should be an equality among all. Tell me, ungrateful mortal, what sort of things are they which you deny to be of God's goodness, and what equality do you mean? <q>Such an one,</q> you will say, <q>has been a cripple from his childhood; another is mad, and is possessed; another has arrived at extreme old age, and has spent his whole life in poverty; another in the most painful diseases: are these works of Providence? One man is deaf, another dumb, another poor, while another, impious, yea, utterly impious, and full of ten thousand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vices</font></u></a>, enjoys <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and keeps concubines, and parasites, and is owner of a splendid mansion, and lives an idle life.</q> And many instances of the sort they string together, and weave a long account of complaint against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>What then are we to say to them? Now if they were Greeks, and were to tell us that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15183a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">universe</font></u></a> is governed by some one or other, we should in turn address to them the self-same words, <q>What then, are things without a providence? How then is it that you reverence gods, and worship genii and heroes? For if there is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, some one or other superintends the whole.</q> But if any, whether <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christians</font></u></a> or Heathen, should be impatient at this, and be wavering, what shall we say to them? Why, could so many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, tell me, arise of themselves? The daily light? The beautiful order and the forethought that exist in all things? The mazy dances of the stars? The equable course of nights and days? The regular gradation of nature in vegetables, and animals, and men? Who, tell me, is it that orders these? If there were no superintending Being, but all things combined together of themselves, who then was it that made this vault revolve, so beautiful, so vast, I mean the sky, and set it upon the earth, nay more, upon the waters? Who is it that gives the fruitful seasons? Who implanted so great power in seeds and vegetables? For that which is accidental is necessarily disorderly; whereas that which is orderly implies design. For which, tell me, of the things around us that are accidental, is not full of great disorder, and of great tumult and confusion? Nor do I speak of things accidental only, but of those also which imply some agent, but an unskillful agent. For example, let there be timber and stone, and let there be lime withal; and let a man unskilled in building take them, and begin building, and set hard to work; will he not spoil and destroy everything? Again, take a vessel without a pilot, containing everything which a vessel ought to contain, without a shipwright; I do not say that it is unequipped and unfinished, but though well equipped, it will not be able to sail. And could the vast extent of earth standing on the waters, tell me, ever stand so firmly, and so long a time, without some power to hold it together? And can these views have any reason? Is it not the extreme of absurdity to conceive such a notion? And if the earth supports the heaven, behold another burden still; but if the heaven also is borne upon the waters, there arises again another question. Or rather not another question, for it is the work of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>. For things which are borne upon the water ought not to be made convex, but concave. Wherefore? Because the whole body of anything which is concave is immersed in the waters, as is the case with a ship; whereas of the convex the body is entirely above, and only the rim rests upon the surface; so that it requires a resisting body, hard, and able to sustain it, in order to bear the burden imposed. But does the atmosphere then support the heaven? Why, that is far softer, and more yielding even than water, and cannot sustain anything, no, not the very lightest things, much less so vast a bulk. In fine, if we chose to follow out the argument of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, both generally and in detail, time itself would fail us. For I will now ask him who would start those questions above mentioned, are these things the result of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, or of the want of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>? And if he shall say, that they are not from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, then again I will ask, how then did they arise? But no, he will never be able to give any account at all. And do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that?</p>
<p>Much more then is it your duty not to question, not to be over curious, in those things which concern man. And why not? Because man is nobler than all these, and these were made for his sake, not he for their sake. If then you know not so much as the skill and contrivance that are visible in His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providence</font></u></a>, how shall you be able to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> the reasons, where he himself is the subject? Tell me, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, why did God form him so small, so far below the height of heaven, as that he should even <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> of the things which appear above him? Why are the northern and southern climes uninhabitable? Tell me, I say, why is the night made longer in winter and shorter in summer? Why are the degrees of cold and heat such as they are? Why is the body mortal? And ten thousand questions besides I will ask you, and if you will, will never cease asking. And in one and all you will surely be at a loss to answer. And thus is this of all things most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a>, that the reasons of things are kept secret from us. For surely, one would have imagined man to be the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> of all things, were there not this to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">humble</font></u></a> our understanding.</p>
<p><q>But such an one,</q> you will say, <q>is poor, and poverty is an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. And what is it to be sick, and what is it to be crippled?</q> Oh, man, they are nothing. One thing alone is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, that is to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>; this is the only thing we ought to search to the bottom. And yet we omit to search into the causes of what are really <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a>, and busy ourselves about other things. Why is it that not one of us ever examines why he has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sinned</font></u></a>? To <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>—is it then in my power, or is it not in my power? And why need I go round about me for a number of reasons? I will seek for the matter within myself. Now then did I ever master my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>? Did I ever master my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, either through shame, or through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of man? Then whenever I discover this done, I shall discover that to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is in my own power. No one examines these matters, no one busies himself about them. But only according to Job, <q>Man in a way altogether different swims upon words.</q> For why does it concern you, if such an one is blind, or such an one poor? God has not commanded you to look to this, but to what you yourself art doing. For if on the one hand you doubt that there is any power superintending the world, you are of all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> the most senseless; but if you are persuaded of this, why <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05141a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">doubt</font></u></a> that it is our duty to please God?</p>
<p><q>Giving thanks always,</q> he says, <q>for all things to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Go to the physician's, and you will see him, whenever a man is discovered to have a wound, using the knife and the cautery. But no, in your case, I say not so much as this; but go to the carpenter's. And yet thou dost not examine his reasons, although you understand not one of the things which are done there, and many things will appear to you to be difficulties; as, for instance, when he hollows the wood, when he alters its outward shape. Nay, I would bring you to a more intelligible craft still, for instance, that of the painter, and there your head will swim. For tell me, does he not seem to be doing what he does, at random? For what do his lines mean, and the turns and bends of the lines? But when he puts on the colors, then the beauty of the art will become conspicuous. Yet still, not even then will you be able to attain to any accurate understanding of it. But why do I speak of carpenters, and painters, our fellow-servants? Tell me, how does the bee frame her comb, and then shall you speak about God also. Master the handiwork of the ant, the spider, and the swallow, and then shall you speak about God also. Tell me these things. But no, thou never canst. Will you not cease then, O man, your vain enquiries? For vain indeed they are. Will you not cease busying yourself in vain about many things? Nothing so wise as this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, where they that profess they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> nothing are wisest of all, and they that spend overmuch labor on these questions, the most foolish of all. So that to profess <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> is not everywhere a sign of wisdom, but sometimes of folly also. For tell me, suppose there were two men, and one of them should profess to stretch out his lines, and to measure the expanse that intervenes between the earth and heaven, and the other were to laugh at him, and declare that he did not understand it, tell me, I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, which should we laugh at, him that said he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>, or him that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> not? Evidently, the man that said that he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a>. He that is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, therefore, is wiser than he that professes to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>. And what again? If any one were to profess to tell us how many cups of water the sea contains, and another should profess his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>, is not the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a> here again wiser than the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>? Surely, vastly so. And why so? Because that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> itself is but intense <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorance</font></u></a>. For he indeed who says that he is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">ignorant</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> something. And what is that? That it is incomprehensible to man. Yes, and this is no small portion of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>. Whereas he that says he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>, he of all others <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> not what he says he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>, and is for this very reason utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Moral. Alas! How many things are there to teach us to bridle this unseasonable impertinence and idle curiosity; and yet we refrain not, but are curious about the lives of others; as, why one is a cripple, and why another is poor. And so by this way of reasoning we shall fall into another sort of trifling which is endless, as, why such an one is a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>? And, why all are not men? Why there is such a thing as an ass? Why an ox? Why a dog? Why a wolf? Why a stone? Why wood? And thus the argument will run out to an interminable length. This in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> is the reason, why God has marked out limits to our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a>, and has laid them deep in nature. And mark, now, the excess of this busy curiosity. For though we look up to so great a height as from earth to heaven, and are not at all affected by it; yet as soon as ever we go up to the top of a lofty tower, and have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> to stoop over a little, and look down, a sort of giddiness and dizziness immediately seizes us. Now, tell me the reason of this. No, you could never find out a reason for it. Why is it that the eye possesses greater power than other senses, and is caught by more distant objects? And one might see it by comparison with the case of hearing. For no one will ever be able to shout so loudly, as to fill the air as far as the eye can reach, nor to hear at so great a distance. Why are not all the members of equal <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>? Why have not all received one function and one place? <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> also searched into these questions; or rather he did not search into them, for he was wise; but where he comes by chance upon this topic, he says, <q>Each one of them, has God set even as it has pleased Him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co012.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 12:18</font></u></a></span> He assigns the whole to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>. And so then let us only <q>give thanks for all things.</q> <q>Wherefore,</q> says he, <q>give thanks for all things.</q> This is the part of a well-disposed, of a wise, of an intelligent servant; the opposite is that of a tattler, and an idler, and a busy-body. Do we not see among servants, that those among them who are worthless and good for nothing, are both tattlers, and triflers and that they pry into the concerns of their masters, which they are desirous to conceal: whereas the intelligent and well-disposed look to one thing only, how they may fulfill their service. He that says much, does nothing: as he that does much, never says a word out of season. Hence <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said, where he wrote concerning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a>, <q>And they learn not only to be idle, but tattlers also.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:13</font></u></a></span> Tell me, now, which is the widest difference, between our age and that of children, or between God and men? Between ourselves compared with gnats, or God compared with us? Plainly between God and us. Why then do you busy yourself to such an extent in all these questions? <q>Give thanks for all things.</q> <q>But what,</q> say you, <q>if a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heathen</font></u></a> should ask the question? How am I to answer him? He desires to learn from me whether there is a Providence, for he himself denies that there is any being thus exercising foresight.</q> Turn round then, and ask him the same question yourself. He will deny therefore that there is a Providence. Yet that there is a Providence, is plain from what you have said; but that it is incomprehensible, is plain from those things whereof we cannot discover the reason. For if in things where men are the disposers, we oftentimes do not understand the method of the disposition, and in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> many of them appear to us inconsistent, and yet at the same time we acquiesce, how much more will this be so in the case of God? However, with God nothing either is inconsistent, or appears so to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faithful</font></u></a>. Wherefore let us <q>give thanks for all things,</q> let us give Him <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> for all things.</p>
<p><q>Subjecting yourselves one to another,</q> he says, <q>in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> For if you submit yourself for a ruler's sake, or for money's sake, or from respectfulness, much more from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. Let there be an interchange of service and submission. For then will there be no such thing as slavish service. Let not one sit down in the rank of a freeman, and the other in the rank of a slave; rather it were better that both masters and slaves be servants to one another—far better to be a slave in this way than free in any other; as will be evident from hence. Suppose the case of a man who should have an hundred slaves, and he should in no way serve them; and suppose again a different case, of an hundred friends, all waiting upon one another. Which will lead the happier life? Which with the greater pleasure, with the more enjoyment? In the one case there is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, no provocation, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, nor anything else of the kind whatever; in the other all is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and apprehension. In the one case too the whole is forced, in the other is of free choice. In the one case they serve one another because they are forced to do so, in the other with mutual gratification. Thus does God will it to be; for this He washed His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples'</font></u></a> feet. Nay more, if you have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> to examine the matter nicely, there is indeed on the part of masters a return of service. For what if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a> suffer not that return of service to appear? Yet if the slave on the one hand render his bodily service, and thou maintain that body, and supply it with food and clothing and shoes, this is an exchange of service: because unless thou render your service as well, neither will he render his, but will be free, and no law will compel him to do it if he is not supported. If this then is the case with servants, where is the absurdity, if it should also become the case with free men. <q>Subjecting yourselves in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> How great then the obligation, when we shall also have a reward. But he does not choose to submit himself to you? However do thou submit yourself; not simply yield, but submit yourself. Entertain this feeling towards all, as if all were your masters. For thus shall you soon have all as your slaves, enslaved to you with the most abject slavery. For you will then more surely make them yours, when without receiving anything of theirs, thou of yourself renderest them of your own. This is <q>subjecting yourselves one to another in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>,</q> in order that we may subdue all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>, be servants of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and preserve the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> we owe to one another. And then shall we be able also to be counted worthy of the lovingkindness which comes of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and mercies of His only-begotten Son, with whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and forever and ever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p>A certain wise man, setting down a number of things in the rank of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_2_0_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessings</font></u></a>, set down this also in the rank of a blessing, <q>A wife agreeing with her husband.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir025.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 25:1</font></u></a></span> And elsewhere again he sets it down among blessings, that a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> should dwell in harmony with her husband. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir040.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 40:23</font></u></a></span> And indeed from the beginning, God appears to have made special provision for this union; and discoursing of the two as one, He said thus, <q>Male and female created He them</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen001.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 1:27</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>There is neither male nor female.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gal003.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Galatians 3:28</font></u></a></span> For there is no relationship between man and man so close as that between man and wife, if they be joined together as they should be. And therefore a certain blessed man too, when he would express surpassing <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and was mourning for one that was dear to him, and of one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> with him, did not mention father, nor mother, nor child, nor brother, nor friend, but what? <q>Your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to me was wonderful,</q> says he, <q>passing the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2sa001.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Samuel 1:26</font></u></a></span> For indeed, in very deed, this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> is more despotic than any despotism: for others indeed may be strong, but this passion is not only strong, but unfading. For there is a certain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> deeply seated in our nature, which imperceptibly to ourselves knits together these bodies of ours. Thus even from the very beginning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> sprang from man, and afterwards from man and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> sprang both man and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>. Perceivest thou the close bond and connection? And how that God suffered not a different kind of nature to enter in from without? And mark, how many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">providential</font></u></a> arrangements He made. He permitted the man to marry his own sister; or rather not his sister, but his daughter; nay, nor yet his daughter, but something more than his daughter, even his own flesh. And thus the whole He framed from one beginning, gathering all together, like stones in a building, into one. For neither on the one hand did He form her from without, and this was that the man might not feel towards her as towards an alien; nor again did He confine marriage to her, that she might not, by contracting herself, and making all center in herself, be cut off from the rest. Thus as in the case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">plants</font></u></a>, they are of all others the best, which have but a single stem, and spread out into a number of branches; (since were all confined to the root alone, all would be to no purpose, whereas again had it a number of roots, the tree would be no longer worthy of admiration;) so, I say, is the case here also. From one, namely Adam, He made the whole race to spring, preventing them by the strongest necessity from being ever torn asunder, or separated; and afterwards, making it more restricted, He no longer allowed sisters and daughters to be wives, lest we should on the other hand contract our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> to one point, and thus in another manner be cut off from one another. Hence Christ said, <q>He which made them from the beginning, made them male and female.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat019.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 19:4</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>For great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> are hence produced, and great benefits, both to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">families</font></u></a> and to states. For there is nothing which so welds our life together as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of man and wife. For this many will lay aside even their arms, for this they will give up life itself. And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> would never without a reason and without an object have spent so much pains on this subject, as when he says here, <q>Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</q> And why so? Because when they are in harmony, the children are well brought up, and the domestics are in good order, and neighbors, and friends, and relations enjoy the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230120.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fragrance</font></u></a>. But if it be otherwise, all is turned upside down, and thrown into confusion. And just as when the generals of an army are at peace one with another, all things are in due subordination, whereas on the other hand, if they are at variance, everything is turned upside down; so, I say, is it also here. Wherefore, says he, <q>Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</q></p>
<p>Yet how strange! For how then is it, that it is said elsewhere, <q>If one bid not farewell both to wife and to husband, he cannot follow me</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk014.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Luke 14:26</font></u></a></span> For if it is their duty to be in subjection <q>as unto the Lord,</q> how says He that they must depart from them for the Lord's sake? Yet their duty indeed it is, their bounden duty. But the word <q>as</q> is not necessarily and universally expressive of exact equality. He either means this, <q>'as' <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that you are servants to the Lord</q>; (which, by the way, is what he says elsewhere, that, even though they do it not for the husband's sake, yet must they primarily for the Lord's sake;) or else he means, <q>when you obey your husband, do so as serving the Lord.</q> For if he who resists these external authorities, those of governments, I mean, <q>withstands the ordinance of God</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom013.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 13:2</font></u></a></span>, much more does she who submits not herself to her husband. Such was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God's</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> from the beginning.</p>
<p>Let us take as our fundamental position then that the husband occupies the place of the <q>head,</q> and the wife the place of the <q>body.</q></p>
<p>Ver. 23, 24. Then, he proceeds with arguments and says that <q>the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, being Himself the Saviour of the body. But as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> is subject to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, so let the wives be to their husbands in everything.</q></p>
<p>Then after saying, <q>The husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>,</q> he further adds, <q>and He is the Saviour of the body.</q> For indeed the head is the saving health of the body. He had already laid down beforehand for man and wife, the ground and provision of their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, assigning to each their proper place, to the one that of authority and forethought, to the other that of submission. As then <q>the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>,</q> that is, both husbands and wives, <q>is subject unto Christ, so also ye wives submit yourselves to your husbands, as unto <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 25</font></u></a>. <q>Husbands, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> your wives, even as Christ also loved the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>You have heard how great the submission; you have extolled and marvelled at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, how, like an admirable and spiritual man, he welds together our whole life. Thou did well. But now hear what he also requires at your hands; for again he employs the same example.</p>
<p><q>Husbands,</q> says he, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> your wives, even as Christ also loved the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>You have seen the measure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>, hear also the measure of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Would you have your wife <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a> unto you, as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> is to Christ? Take then yourself the same provident care for her, as Christ takes for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Yea, even if it shall be needful for you to give your life for her, yea, and to be cut into pieces ten thousand times, yea, and to endure and undergo any suffering whatever—refuse it not. Though you should undergo all this, yet will you not, no, not even then, have done anything like Christ. For thou indeed art doing it for one to whom you are already knit; but He for one who turned her back on Him and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> Him. In the same way then as He laid at His feet her who turned her back on Him, who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>, and spurned, and disdained Him, not by menaces, nor by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, nor by terror, nor by anything else of the kind, but by his unwearied affection; so also do thou behave yourself toward your wife. Yea, though thou see her looking down upon you, and disdaining, and scorning you, yet by your great thoughtfulness for her, by affection, by kindness, you will be able to lay her at your feet. For there is nothing more powerful to sway than these bonds, and especially for husband and wife. A servant, indeed, one will be able, perhaps, to bind down by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; nay not even him, for he will soon start away and be gone. But the partner of one's life, the mother of one's children, the foundation of one's every <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">joy</font></u></a>, one ought never to chain down by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and menaces, but with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> and good temper. For what sort of union is that, where the wife trembles at her husband? And what sort of pleasure will the husband himself enjoy, if he dwells with his wife as with a slave, and not as with a free-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>? Yea, though you should suffer anything on her account, do not upbraid her; for neither did Christ do this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 26</font></u></a>. <q>And gave Himself up,</q> he says, <q>for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it.</q></p>
<p>So then she was unclean! So then she had blemishes, so then she was unsightly, so then she was worthless! Whatsoever kind of wife you shall take, yet shall you never take such a bride as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, when Christ took her, nor one so far removed from you as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> was from Christ. And yet for all that, He did not abhor her, nor loathe her for her surpassing deformity. Would you hear her deformity described? Hear what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says, <q>For you were once darkness.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:8</font></u></a></span> Did you see the blackness of her hue? What blacker than darkness? But look again at her boldness, <q>living,</q> says he, <q>in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">malice</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08326b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">envy</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/tit003.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Titus 3:3</font></u></a></span> Look again at her impurity; <q>disobedient, foolish.</q> But what am I saying? She was both foolish, and of an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> tongue; and yet notwithstanding, though so many were her blemishes, yet did He give Himself up for her in her deformity, as for one in the bloom of youth, as for one dearly beloved, as for one of wonderful beauty. And it was in admiration of this that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> said, For scarcely for a righteous man will one die <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:7</font></u></a></span>; and again, <q>in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:8</font></u></a></span> And though such as this, He took her, He arrayed her in beauty, and washed her, and refused not even this, to give Himself for her.</p>
<p>Ver. 26, 27. <q>That He might sanctify it having cleansed it,</q> he proceeds, <q>by the washing of water with the word; that He might present the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> to Himself a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a> Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish.</q></p>
<p><q>By the washing or laver</q> He washes her uncleanness. <q>By the word,</q> says he. What word? <q>In the Name of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat028.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 28:19</font></u></a></span> And not simply has He adorned her, but has made her <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</q> Let us then also seek after this beauty ourselves, and we shall be able to create it. Seek not thou at your wife's hand, things which she is not able to possess. Do you see that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> had all things at her Lord's hands? By Him was made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glorious</font></u></a>, by Him was made pure, by Him made without blemish? Turn not your back on your wife because of her deformity. Hear the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> that says, <q>The bee is little among such as fly, but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir011.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 11:3</font></u></a></span> She is of God's fashioning. Thou reproachest not her, but Him that made her; what can the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> do? Praise her not for her beauty. Praise and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> based on personal beauty belong to unchastened <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>. Seek thou for beauty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Imitate the Bridegroom of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. Outward beauty is full of conceit and great license, and throws men into jealousy, and the thing often makes you suspect monstrous things. But has it any pleasure? For the first or second month, perhaps, or at most for the year: but then no longer; the admiration by familiarity wastes away. Meanwhile the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evils</font></u></a> which arose from the beauty still abide, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12405a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pride</font></u></a>, the folly, the contemptuousness. Whereas in one who is not such, there is nothing of this kind. But the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> having begun on just grounds, still continues ardent, since its object is beauty of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and not of body. What better, tell me, than heaven? What better than the stars? Tell me of what body you will, yet is there none so fair. Tell me of what eyes you will, yet are there none so sparkling. When these were created, the very Angels gazed with wonder, and we gaze with wonder now; yet not in the same degree as at first. Such is familiarity; things do not strike us in the same degree. How much more in the case of a wife! And if moreover disease come too, all is at once fled. Let us seek in a wife affectionateness, modest-mindedness, gentleness; these are the characteristics of beauty. But loveliness of person let us not seek, nor upbraid her upon these points, over which she has no power, nay, rather, let us not upbraid at all, (it were rudeness,) nor let us be impatient, nor sullen. Do ye not see how many, after living with beautiful wives, have ended their lives pitiably, and how many, who have lived with those of no great beauty, have run on to extreme old age with great enjoyment. Let us wipe off the <q>spot</q> that is within, let us smooth the <q>wrinkles</q> that are within, let us do away the <q>blemishes</q> that are on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Such is the beauty God requires. Let us make her fair in God's sight, not in our own. Let us not look for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, nor for that high-birth which is outward, but for that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> nobility which is in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. Let no one endure to get rich by a wife; for such riches are base and disgraceful; no, by no means let any one seek to get rich from this source. <q>For they that desire to be rich, fall into a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14504a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temptation</font></u></a> and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lusts</font></u></a>, and into destruction and perdition.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti006.htm#verse9" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 6:9</font></u></a></span> Seek not therefore in your wife abundance of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, and you shall find everything else go well. Who, tell me, would overlook the most important things, to attend to those which are less so? And yet, alas! This is in every case our feeling. Yes, if we have a son, we concern ourselves not how he may be made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, but how we may get him a rich wife; not how he may be well-mannered, but well-monied: if we follow a business, we enquire not how it may be clear of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, but how it may bring us in most profit. And everything has become money; and thus is everything corrupted and ruined, because that passion possesses us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 28</font></u></a>. <q>Even so ought husbands to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> their own wives,</q> says he, <q>as their own bodies.</q></p>
<p>What, again, means this? To how much greater a similitude, and stronger example has he come; and not only so, but also to one how much nearer and clearer, and to a fresh obligation. For that other one was of no very constraining force, for He was Christ, and was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and gave Himself. He now manages his argument on a different ground, saying, <q>so ought men</q>; because the thing is not a favor, but a debt. Then, <q>as their own bodies.</q> And why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse29" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 29</font></u></a>. <q>For no man ever <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it.</q></p>
<p>That is, tends it with exceeding care. And how is she his flesh? Hearken; <q>This now is bone of my bones,</q> says Adam, <q>and flesh of my flesh.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen002.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 2:23</font></u></a></span> For she is made of matter taken from us. And not only so, but also, <q>they shall be,</q> says <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, <q>one flesh.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen002.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 2:24</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>Even as Christ also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> Here he returns to the former example.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 30</font></u></a>. <q>Because we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.</q> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 31</font></u></a>. <q>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.</q> </p>
<p>Behold again a third ground of obligation; for he shows that a man leaving them that begot him, and from whom he was born, is knit to his wife; and that then the one flesh is, father, and mother, and the child, from the substance of the two commingled. For indeed by the commingling of their seeds is the child produced, so that the three are one flesh. Thus then are we in relation to Christ; we become one flesh by participation, and we much more than the child. And why and how so? Because so it has been from the beginning.</p>
<p>Tell me not that such and such things are so. Do you see not that we have in our own flesh itself many defects? For one man, for instance, is lame, another has his feet distorted, another his hands withered, another some other member weak; and yet nevertheless he does not grieve at it, nor cut it off, but oftentimes prefers it even to the other. Naturally enough; for it is part of himself. As great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> as each entertains towards himself, so great he would have us entertain towards a wife. Not because we partake of the same nature; no, this ground of duty towards a wife is far greater than that; it is that there are not two bodies but one; he the head, she the body. And how says he elsewhere <q>and the Head of Christ is God</q>? <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:3</font></u></a></span> This I too say, that as we are one body, so also are Christ and the Father One. And thus then is the Father also found to be our Head. He sets down two examples, that of the natural body and that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> body. And hence he further adds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 32</font></u></a>. <q>This is great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p>Why does he call it a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>? That it was something great and wonderful, the blessed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, or rather <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, intimated. For the present, however, says he, I speak regarding Christ, that having left the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, He came down, and came to the Bride, and became one Spirit. <q>For he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:17</font></u></a></span> And well says he, <q>it is a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>.</q> And then as though he were saying, <q>But still nevertheless the allegory does not destroy affection,</q> he adds,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 33</font></u></a>. <q>Nevertheless do ye also severally <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> her husband.</q></p>
<p>For indeed, in very deed, a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> it is, yea, a great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>, that a man should leave him that gave him being, him that begot him, and that brought him up, and her that travailed with him and had sorrow, those that have bestowed upon him so many and great benefits, those with whom he has been in familiar intercourse, and be joined to one who was never even seen by him and who has nothing in common with him, and should <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> her before all others. A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> it is indeed. And yet are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> not distressed when these events take place, but rather, when they do not take place; and are delighted when their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> is spent and lavished upon it.— A great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> indeed! And one that contains some hidden wisdom. Such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophetically</font></u></a> showed it to be from the very first; such now also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> proclaims it, where he says, <q>concerning Christ and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>However not for the husband's sake alone it is thus said, but for the wife's sake also, that <q>he cherish her as his own flesh, as Christ also the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>,</q> and, <q>that the wife <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> her husband.</q> He is no longer setting down the duties of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> only, but what? <q>That she <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> her husband.</q> The wife is a second authority; let not her then demand equality, for she is under the head; nor let him despise her as being in subjection, for she is the body; and if the head despise the body, it will itself also perish. But let him bring in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> on his part as a counterpoise to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> on her part. For example, let the hands and the feet, and all the rest of the members be given up for service to the head, but let the head provide for the body, seeing it contains every sense in itself. Nothing can be better than this union.</p>
<p>And yet how can there ever be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, one may say, where there is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>? It will exist there, I say, preëminently. For she that fears and reverences, loves also; and she that loves, fears and reverences him as being the head, and loves him as being a member, since the head itself is a member of the body at large. Hence he places the one in subjection, and the other in authority, that there may be peace; for where there is equal authority there can never be peace; neither where a house is a democracy, nor where all are rulers; but the ruling power must of necessity be one. And this is universally the case with matters referring to the body, inasmuch as when men are spiritual, there will be peace. There were <q>five thousand <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>,</q> and not one of them said, <q>that anything of the things which he possessed was his own</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act004.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 4:32</font></u></a></span>, but they were subject one to another; an indication this of wisdom, and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. The principle of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, however, he explains; that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> he does not. And mark, how on that of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> he enlarges, stating the arguments relating to Christ and those relating to one's own flesh, the words, <q>For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> shall a man leave his father and mother.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse31" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:31</font></u></a></span> Whereas upon those drawn from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> he forbears to enlarge. And why so? Because he would rather that this principle prevail, this, namely, of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; for where this exists, everything else follows of course, but where the other exists, not necessarily. For the man who loves his wife, even though she be not a very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedient</font></u></a> one, still will bear with everything. So difficult and impracticable is unanimity, where <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a> are not bound together by that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> which is founded in supreme authority; at all events, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> will not necessarily effect this. Accordingly, he dwells the more upon this, which is the strong tie. And the wife though seeming to be the loser in that she was charged to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>, is the gainer, because the principal duty, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, is charged upon the husband. <q>But what,</q> one may say, <q>if a wife reverence me not?</q> Never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>, you are to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, fulfill your own duty. For though that which is due from others may not follow, we ought of course to do our duty. This is an example of what I mean. He says, <q>submitting yourselves one to another in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>.</q> And what then if another submit not himself? Still <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> thou the law of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Just so, I say, is it also here. Let the wife at least, though she be not loved, still reverence notwithstanding, that nothing may lie at her door; and let the husband, though his wife reverence him not, still show her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> notwithstanding, that he himself be not wanting in any point. For each has received his own.</p>
<p>This then is marriage when it takes place according to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, spiritual marriage, and spiritual birth, not of blood, nor of travail, nor of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the flesh. Such was the birth of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, not of blood, nor of travail. Such also was that of Isaac. Hear how the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a> says, <q>And it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">women</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen018.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 18:11</font></u></a></span> Yea, a marriage it is, not of passion, nor of the flesh, but wholly spiritual, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> being united to God by a union unspeakable, and which He alone <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a>. Therefore he says, <q>He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co006.htm#verse17" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 6:17</font></u></a></span> Mark how earnestly he endeavors to unite both flesh with flesh, and spirit with spirit. And where are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a>? Never surely, if marriage were a thing to be condemned, would he have called Christ and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a> a bride and bridegroom; never would he have brought forward by way of exhortation the words, <q>A man shall leave his father and his mother</q>; and again have added, that it was <q>spoken in regard of Christ and of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> For of her it is that the Psalmist also says, <q>Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house. So shall the king desire your beauty.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa045.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 45:10-11</font></u></a></span> Therefore also Christ says, <q>I came out from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and have come.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh016.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 16:28</font></u></a></span> But when I say, that He left the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> not such a thing as happens among <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, a change of place; for just in the same way as the word <q>go forth</q> is used, not because He literally came forth, but because of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">incarnation</font></u></a>, so also is the expression, <q>He left the Father.</q></p>
<p>Now why did he not say of the wife also, She shall be joined unto her husband? Why, I say, is this? Because he was discoursing concerning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and was discoursing to the husband. For to her indeed he discourses concerning reverence, and says, <q>the husband is the head of the wife</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:23</font></u></a></span>, and again, <q>Christ is the Head of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> Whereas to him he discourses concerning <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and commits to him this province of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, and declares to him that which pertains to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, thus binding him and cementing him to her. For the man that leaves his father for the sake of his wife, and then again, leaves this very wife herself and abandons her, what forbearance can he deserve?</p>
<p>Do you see not how great a share of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> God would have her enjoy, in that he has taken you away from your father, and has linked you to her? What then, a man may say, if our duty is done, and yet she does not follow the example? <q>Yet if the unbelieving departs, let him depart; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co007.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 7:15</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>However, when you hear of <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>,</q> demand that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> which becomes a free <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, not as though thou were exacting it of a slave. For she is your own body; and if you do this, you reproach yourself in dishonoring your own body. And of what nature is this <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a></q>? It is the not contradicting, the not rebelling, the not being fond of the preëminence. It is enough that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> be kept within these bounds. But if you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, as you are commanded, you will make it yet greater. Or rather it will not be any longer by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> that you will be doing this, but <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> itself will have its effect. The sex is somehow weaker, and needs much support, much condescension.</p>
<p>But what will they say, who are knit together in second marriages? I speak not at all in condemnation of them, God forbid; for the Apostle himself permits them, though indeed by way of condescension.</p>
<p>Supply her with everything. Do everything and endure trouble for her sake. Necessity is laid upon you.</p>
<p>Here he does not think it right to introduce his counsel, as he in many cases does, with examples from them that are without. That of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, so great and forcible, were alone enough; and more especially as regards the argument of subjection. <q>A man shall leave,</q> he says, <q>his father and mother.</q> Behold, this then is from without. But he does not say, and <q>shall dwell with,</q> but <q>shall cleave unto,</q> thus showing the closeness of the union, and the fervent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Nay, he is not content with this, but further by what he adds, he explains the subjection in such a way as that the two appear no longer two. He does not say, <q>one spirit,</q> he does not say, <q>one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a></q> (for that is manifest, and is possible to any one), but so as to be <q>one flesh.</q> She is a second authority, possessing indeed an authority, and a considerable equality of dignity; but at the same time the husband has somewhat of superiority. In this consists most chiefly the well-being of the house. For he took that former argument, the example of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, to show that we ought not only to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, but also to govern; <q>that she may be,</q> says he, <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish.</q> But the word <q>flesh</q> has reference to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>— and the word <q>shall cleave</q> has in like manner reference to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. For if you shall make her <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish,</q> everything else will follow. Seek the things which are of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and those which are of man will follow readily enough. Govern your wife, and thus will the whole house be in harmony. Hear what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> says. <q>And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co014.htm#verse35" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 14:35</font></u></a></span> If we thus regulate our own houses, we shall be also fit for the management of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>. For indeed a house is a little Church. Thus it is possible for us by becoming good husbands and wives, to surpass all others.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>, and Sarah, and Isaac, and the three hundred and eighteen born in his house. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen014.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 14:14</font></u></a></span> How the whole house was harmoniously knit together, how the whole was full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a> and fulfilled the Apostolic injunction. She also <q>reverenced her husband</q>; for hear her own words, <q>It has not yet happened unto me even until now, and my lord is old also.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen018.htm#verse12" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 18:12</font></u></a></span> And he again so loved her, that in all things he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a> her commands. And the young child was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, and the servants born in the house, they too were so excellent that they refused not even to hazard their lives with their master; they delayed not, nor asked the reason. Nay, one of them, the chief, was so admirable, that he was even entrusted with the marriage of the only-begotten child, and with a journey into a foreign country. <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen024.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 24:1-67</font></u></a></span> For just as with a general, when his soldiery also is well organized, the enemy has no quarter to attack; so, I say, is it also here: when husband and wife and children and servants are all interested in the same things, great is the harmony of the house. Since where this is not the case, the whole is oftentimes overthrown and broken up by one bad servant; and that single one will often mar and utterly destroy the whole.</p>
<p>Moral. Let us then be very thoughtful both for our wives, and children, and servants; <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowing</font></u></a> that we shall thus be establishing for ourselves an easy government, and shall have our accounts with them gentle and lenient, and say, <q>Behold I, and the children which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> has given me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa008.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 8:18</font></u></a></span> If the husband command respect, and the head be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a>, then will the rest of the body sustain no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>. Now what is the wife's fitting behavior, and what the husband's, he states accurately, charging her to reverence him as the head, and him to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> her as a wife; but how, it may be said, can these things be? That they ought indeed so to be, he has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">proved</font></u></a>. But how they can be so, I will tell you. They will be so, if we will despise money, if we will look but to one thing only, excellence of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, if we will keep the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of God before our eyes. For what he says in his discourse to servants, <q>whatsoever any man does, whether it be good or <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, the same shall he receive of the Lord</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph006.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 6:8</font></u></a></span>; this is also the case here. Love her therefore not for her sake so much as for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> sake. This, at least, he as much as intimates, in saying, <q>as unto the Lord.</q> So then do everything, as in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a> to the Lord, and as doing everything for His sake. This were enough to induce and to persuade us, and not to suffer that there should be any teasing and dissension. Let none be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> when <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14035b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">slandering</font></u></a> the husband to his wife; no, nor let the husband <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> anything at random against the wife, nor let the wife be without reason inquisitive about his goings out and his comings in. No, nor on any account let the husband ever render himself worthy of any suspicion whatever. For what, tell me, what if you shall devote yourself all the day to your friends, and give the evening to your wife, and not even thus be able to content her, and place her out of reach of suspicion? Though your wife complain, yet be not annoyed— it is her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, not her folly— they are the complaints of fervent attachment, and burning affection, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. Yes, she is afraid lest any one have stolen her marriage bed, lest any one have injured her in that which is the summit of her blessings, lest any one have taken away from her him who is her head, lest any one have broken through her marriage chamber.</p>
<p>There is also another ground of petty jealousy. Let neither claim too much service of the servants, neither the husband from the maid-servant, nor the wife from the man-servant. For these things also are enough to beget suspicion. For consider, I say, that righteous household I spoke of. Sarah herself bade the patriarch take Hagar. She herself directed it, no one compelled her, nor did the husband attempt it; no, although he had dragged on so long a period childless, yet he chose never to become a father, rather than to grieve his wife. And yet even after all this, what said Sarah? <q>The Lord judge between me and you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen016.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 16:5</font></u></a></span> Now, I say, had he been any one else would he not have been moved to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>? Would he not also have stretched forth his hand, saying as it were, <q>What do you mean? I had no desire to have anything to do with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>; it was all your own doing; and do you turn again and accuse me?</q>— But no, he says nothing of the sort—but what? <q>Behold, your maid is in your hand; do to her that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> in your eyes.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/gen016.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Genesis 16:6</font></u></a></span> He delivered up the partner of his bed, that he might not grieve Sarah. And yet surely is there nothing greater than this for producing affection. For if partaking of the same table produces unanimity even in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a> towards their foes, (and the Psalmist says, <q>Who ate sweet food at the same table with me</q>); much more will the becoming one flesh— for such is the being the partner of the bed— be effectual to draw us together. Yet did none of these things avail to overcome him; but he delivered Hagar up to his wife, to show that nothing had been done by his own fault. Nay, and what is more, he sent her forth when with child. Who would not have pitied one that had conceived a child by himself? Yet was the just man unmoved, for he set before everything else the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> he owed his wife.</p>
<p>Let us then imitate him ourselves. Let no one reproach his neighbor with his poverty; let no one be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> with money; and then all difficulties will be at an end.</p>
<p>Neither let a wife say to her husband, <q>Unmanly coward that you are, full of sluggishness and dullness, and fast asleep! Here is such a one, a low man, and of low parentage, who runs his risks, and makes his voyages, and has made a good fortune; and his wife wears her jewels, and goes out with her pair of milk-white mules; she rides about everywhere, she has troops of slaves, and a swarm of eunuchs, but you have cowered down and livest to no purpose.</q> Let not a wife say these things, nor anything like them. For she is the body, not to dictate to the head, but to submit herself and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a>. <q>But how,</q> some one will say, <q>is she to endure poverty? Where is she to look for consolation?</q> Let her select and put beside her those who are poorer still. Let her again consider how many noble and high-born maidens have not only received nothing of their husbands, but have even given dowries to them, and have spent their all upon them. Let her reflect on the perils which arise from such riches, and she will cling to this quiet life. In short, if she is affectionately disposed towards her husband, she will utter nothing of the sort. No, she will rather choose to have him near her, though gaining nothing, than gaining ten thousand talents of gold, accompanied with that care and anxiety which always arise to wives from those distant voyages.</p>
<p>Neither, however, let the husband, when he hears these things, on the score of his having the supreme authority, betake himself to revilings and to blows; but let him exhort, let him admonish her, as being less perfect, let him persuade her with arguments. Let him never once lift his hand—far be this from a noble spirit,— no, nor give expression to insults, or taunts, or revilings; but let him regulate and direct her as being wanting in wisdom. Yet how shall this be done? If she be instructed in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> riches, in the heavenly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>, she will make no complaints like these. Let him teach her then, that poverty is no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. Let him teach her, not by what he says only, but also by what he does. Let him teach her to despise <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; and then his wife will speak of nothing, and will desire nothing of the kind. Let him, as if he had an image given into his hands to mould, let him, from that very evening on which he first receives her into the bridal chamber, teach her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14481a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">temperance</font></u></a>, gentleness, and how to live, casting down the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a> at once from the outset, and from the very threshold. Let him discipline her in wisdom, and advise her never to have bits of gold hanging at her ears, and down her cheeks, and laid round about her neck, nor laid up about the chamber, nor golden and costly garments stored up. But let her chamber be handsome, still let not what is handsome degenerate into finery. No, leave these things to the people of the stage. Adorn your house yourself with all possible neatness, so as rather to breathe an air of soberness than much perfume. For hence will arise two or three good results. First then, the bride will not be grieved, when the apartments are opened, and the tissues, and the golden ornaments, and silver vessels, are sent back to their several owners. Next, the bridegroom will have no anxiety about the loss, nor for the security of the accumulated treasures. Thirdly again, in addition to this, which is the crown of all these benefits, by these very points he will be showing his own judgment, that indeed he has no pleasure in any of these things, and that he will moreover put an end to everything else in keeping with them, and will never so much as allow the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">existence</font></u></a> either of dances, or of immodest songs. I am aware that I shall appear perhaps ridiculous to many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, in giving such admonitions. Still nevertheless, if you will but listen to me, as time goes on, and the benefit of the practice accrues to you, then you will understand the advantage of it. And the laughter will pass off, and you will laugh at the present fashion, and will see that the present practice is really that of silly children and of drunken men. Whereas what I recommend is the part of soberness, and wisdom, and of the sublimest way of life. What then do I say is our duty? Take away from marriage all those shameful, those Satanic, those immodest songs, those companies of profligate young people, and this will avail to chasten the spirit of your bride. For she will at once thus reason with herself; <q>Wonderful! What a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosopher</font></u></a> this man is! He regards the present life as nothing, he has brought me here into his house, to be a mother, to bring up his children, to manage his household affairs.</q> <q>Yes, but these things are distasteful to a bride?</q> Just for the first or second day—but not afterwards; nay, she will even reap from them the greatest delight, and relieve herself of all suspicion. For a man who can endure neither flute-players, nor dancers, nor broken songs, and that too at the very time of his wedding, that man will scarcely endure ever to do or say anything shameful. And then after this, when you have stripped the marriage of all these things, then take her, and form and mould her carefully, encouraging her bashfulness to a considerable length of time, and not destroying it suddenly. For even if the damsel be very bold, yet for a time she will keep silence out of reverence for her husband, and feeling herself a novice in the circumstances. Thou then break not off this reserve too hastily, as unchaste husbands do, but encourage it for a long time. For this will be a great advantage to you. Meanwhile she will not complain, she will not find fault with any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> you may frame for her. During that time therefore, during which shame, like a sort of bridle laid upon the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, suffers her not to make any murmur, nor to complain of what is done, lay down all your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>. For as soon as ever she acquires boldness, she will overturn and confound everything without any sense of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>. When is there then another time so advantageous for moulding a wife, as that during which she reverences her husband, and is still timid, and still shy? Then lay down all your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a> for her, and willing or unwilling, she will certainly <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obey</font></u></a> them. But how shall you help spoiling her modesty? By showing her that you yourself art no less modest than she is, addressing to her but few words, and those too with great gravity and collectedness. Then entrust her with the discourses of wisdom, for her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> will receive them. And establish her in that loveliest habit, I mean modesty. If you wish me, I will also tell you by way of specimen, what sort of language should be addressed to her. For if <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> shrank not from saying, <q>Defraud ye not one the other</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co007.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 7:5</font></u></a></span>, and spoke the language of a bridesmaid, or rather not of a bridesmaid, but of a spiritual <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, much more will not we shrink from speaking. What then is the language we ought to address to her? With great delicacy then we may say to her, <q>I have taken you, my child, to be partner of my life, and have brought you in to share with me in the closest and most <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honorable</font></u></a> ties, in my children, and the superintendence of my house. And what advice then shall I now recommend you?</q> But rather, first talk with her of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> for her; for there is nothing that so contributes to persuade a hearer to admit sincerely the things that are said, as to be assured that they are said with hearty affection. How then are you to show that affection? By saying, <q>when it was in my power to take many to wife, both with better fortunes, and of noble <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05782a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">family</font></u></a>, I did not so choose, but I was enamoured of you, and your beautiful life, your modesty, your gentleness, and soberness of mind.</q> Then immediately from these beginnings open the way to your discourse on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom, and with some circumlocution make a protest against riches. For if you direct your argument at once against riches, you will bear too heavily upon her; but if you do it by taking an occasion, you will succeed entirely. For you will appear to be doing it in the way of an apology, not as a morose sort of person, and ungracious, and over-nice about trifles. But when you take occasion from what relates to herself, she will be even pleased. You will say then, (for I must now take up the discourse again,) that <q>whereas I might have married a rich <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, and with good fortune, I could not endure it. And why so? Not capriciously, and without reason; but I was taught well and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a>, that money is no real possession, but a most despicable thing, a thing which moreover belongs as well to thieves, and to harlots, and to grave-<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14564b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">robbers</font></u></a>. So I gave up these things, and went on till I fell in with the excellence of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, which I value above all gold. For a young damsel who is discreet and ingenuous, and whose heart is set on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">piety</font></u></a>, is worth the whole world. For these reasons then, I courted you, and I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> you, and prefer you to my own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. For the present life is nothing. And I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>, and beseech, and do all I can, that we may be counted worthy so to live this present life, as that we may be able also there in the world to come to be united to one another in perfect security. For our time here is brief and fleeting. But if we shall be counted worthy by having pleased God to so exchange this life for that one, then shall we ever be both with Christ and with each other, with more abundant pleasure. I value your affection above all things, and nothing is so bitter or so painful to me, as ever to be at variance with you. Yes, though it should be my lot to lose my all, and to become poorer than Irus, and undergo the extremest hazards, and suffer any pain whatsoever, all will be tolerable and endurable, so long as your feelings are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> towards me. And then will my children be most dear to me, while you are affectionately disposed towards me. But you must do these duties too.</q> Then mingle also with your discourse the Apostle's words, that <q>thus God would have our affections blended together; for listen to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scripture</font></u></a>, which says, 'For this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a> shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife.' Let us have no pretext for narrow-minded jealousy. Perish riches, and retinue of slaves, and all your outward pomps. To me this is more valuable than all.</q> What weight of gold, what amount of treasures, are so dear to a wife as these words? Never <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> that because she is beloved she will ever rave against you, but confess that you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> her. For courtezans indeed, who now attach themselves to one and now to another, would naturally enough feel contempt towards their lovers, should they hear such expressions as these; but a free-born wife or a noble damsel would never be so affected with such words; no, she will be so much the more subdued. Show her too, that you set a high value on her company, and that you are more desirous to be at home for her sake, than in the market-place. And esteem her before all your friends, and above the children that are born of her, and let these very children be beloved by you for her sake. If she does any good act, praise and admire it; if any foolish one, and such as girls may chance to do, advise her and remind her. Condemn out and out all riches and extravagance, and gently point out the ornament that there is in neatness and in modesty; and be continually teaching her the things that are profitable.</p>
<p>Let your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a> be common. Let each go to Church; and let the husband ask his wife at home, and she again ask her husband, the account of the things which were said and read there. If any poverty should overtake you, cite the case of those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> men, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> and Peter, who were more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> than any kings or rich men; and yet how they spent their lives, in hunger and in thirst. Teach her that there is nothing in life that is to be feared, save only offending against God. If any marry thus, with these views, he will be but little inferior to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10487b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">monks</font></u></a>; the married but little below the unmarried.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> to give dinners, and to make entertainments, let there be nothing immodest, nothing disorderly. If you should find any poor saint able to bless your house, able only just by setting his foot in it to bring in the whole blessing of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, invite him. And shall I say moreover another thing? Let no one of you make it his endeavor to marry a rich <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>, but much rather a poor one. When she comes in, she will not bring so great a source of pleasure from her riches, as she will annoyance from her taunts, from her demanding more than she brought, from her insolence, her extravagance, her vexatious language. For she will say perhaps, <q>I have not yet spent anything of yours, I am still wearing my own apparel, bought with what my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> settled upon me.</q> What do you say, O <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a>? Still wearing your own! And what can be more miserable than this language? Why, you have no longer a body of your own, and have you money of your own? After marriage you are no longer two, but have become one flesh, and are then your possessions two, and not one? Oh! This <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02148b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love of money</font></u></a>! You both have become one man, one living creature; and do you still say <q>my own</q>? Cursed and abominable word that it is, it was brought in by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>. Things far nearer and dearer to us than these has God made all common to us, and are these then not common? We cannot say, <q>my own light, my own sun, my own water</q>: all our greater blessings are common, and are riches not common? Perish the riches ten thousand times over! Or rather not the riches, but those tempers of mind which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not how to make use of riches, but esteem them above all things.</p>
<p>Teach her these lessons also with the rest, but with much graciousness. For since the recommendation of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> has in itself much that is stern, and especially to a young and tender damsel, whenever discourses on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom are to be made, contrive that your manner be full of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and kindness. And above all banish this notion from her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, of <q>mine and yours.</q> If she say the word <q>mine,</q> say unto her, <q>What things do you call yours? For in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a> I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> not; I for my part have nothing of my own. How then do you speak of 'mine,' when all things are yours?</q> Freely grant her the word. Do you not perceive that such is our practice with children? When, while we are holding anything, a child snatches it, and wishes again to get hold of some other thing, we allow it, and say, <q>Yes, and this is yours, and that is yours.</q> The same also let us do with a wife; for her temper is more or less like a child's; and if she says <q>mine,</q> say, <q>why, everything is yours, and I am yours.</q> Nor is the expression one of flattery, but of exceeding wisdom. Thus will you be able to abate her <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wrath</font></u></a>, and put an end to her disappointment. For it is flattery when a man does an unworthy act with an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> object: whereas this is the highest <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">philosophy</font></u></a>. Say then, <q>Even I am yours, my child; this advice <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> gives me where he says, 'The husband has not power over his own body, but the wife.' <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co007.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 7:4</font></u></a></span> If I have no power over my body, but you have, much more have you over my possessions.</q> By saying these things you will have quieted her, you will have quenched the fire, you will have shamed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, you will have made her more your slave than one bought with money, with this language you will have bound her fast. Thus then, by your own language, teach her never to speak of <q>mine and yours.</q> And again, never call her simply by her name, but with terms of endearment, with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, with much <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Honor her, and she will not need <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> from others; she will not want the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> that comes from others, if she enjoys that which comes from you. Prefer her before all, on every account, both for her beauty and her discernment, and praise her. You will thus persuade her to give heed to none that are without, but to scorn all the world except yourself. Teach her the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things will flow from this as from a fountain, and the house will be full of ten thousand blessings. If we seek the things that are incorruptible, these corruptible things will follow. <q>For,</q> says He, <q>seek first His kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto you.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat006.htm#verse33" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 6:33</font></u></a></span> What sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persons</font></u></a>, think you, must the children of such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11478c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">parents</font></u></a> be? What the servants of such masters? What all others who come near them? Will not they too eventually be loaded with blessings out of number? For generally the servants also have their characters formed after their master's, and are fashioned after their humors, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> the same objects, which they have been taught to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, speak the same language, and engage with them in the same pursuits. If thus we regulate ourselves, and attentively study the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Scriptures</font></u></a>, in most things we shall derive instruction from them. And thus shall be able to please <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and to pass through the whole of the present life virtuously, and to attain those blessings which are promised to those that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him, of which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> grant that we may all be counted worthy, through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> and lovingkindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with Whom, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be unto the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, power, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now, and ever, through all ages. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

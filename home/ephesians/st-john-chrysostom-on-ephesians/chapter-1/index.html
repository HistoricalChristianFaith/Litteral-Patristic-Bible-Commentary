<p>He is here alluding to the blessings of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> ; for that was blessing also, but it was not spiritual blessing.

<p>What again is <q>spiritual blessing in the heavenly places?</q> It is not upon earth, he means, as was the case with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. <q>You shall eat the good of the land.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa001.htm#verse19" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 1:19</font></u></a></span> <q>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 3:8</font></u></a></span> <q>The Lord shall bless your land.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu007.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 7:13</font></u></a></span> Here we have nothing of this sort, but what have we? <q>If a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Me, he will keep My word, and I and My Father will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh014.htm#verse23" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 14:23</font></u></a></span> <q>Every one therefore which hears these words of Mine, and does them, shall be likened unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat007.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 7:24-25</font></u></a></span> And what is that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230101.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rock</font></u></a> but those heavenly things which are above the reach of every change? <q>Every one therefore who,</q> says Christ, <q>shall confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father which is in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>: But whosoever shall deny Me, him will I also deny.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse32" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:32-33</font></u></a></span> Again, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:8</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:3</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>Blessed are you which are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11703a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">persecuted</font></u></a> for righteousness sake, for great is your reward in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat005.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 5:11-12</font></u></a></span> Observe, how every where He speaks of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, no where of earth, or of the things on the earth.

<p><q>In Christ.</q></p>
<p>That is to say, this blessing was not by the hand of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, but by Christ Jesus: so that we surpass them not only in the quality of the blessings, but in the Mediator also. As moreover he says in the Epistle to the Hebrews; <q>And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a> indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; but Christ as a Son over His house, whose house are we.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb003.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 3:5-6</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse4" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 4</font></u></a>. <q>Even as,</q> he proceeds, <q>He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish before Him in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>His meaning is somewhat of this sort. Through whom He has blessed us, through Him He has also chosen us. And He, then, it is that shall bestow upon us all those rewards hereafter. He is the very Judge that shall say, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat025.htm#verse34" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 25:34</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>I will that where I am they will also be with Me.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh017.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 17:24</font></u></a></span> And this is a point which he is anxious to prove in almost all his Epistles, that ours is no novel system, but that it had thus been figured from the very first, that it is not the result of any change of purpose, but had been in fact a divine dispensation and fore-ordained. And this is a mark of great solicitude for us.</p>
<p>What is meant by, <q>He chose us in Him?</q> By means of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> which is in Him, Christ, he means, happily ordered this for us before we were born; nay more, before the foundation of the world. And beautiful is that word <q>foundation,</q> as though he were pointing to the world as cast down from some vast height. Yea, vast indeed and ineffable is the height of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, so far removed not in place but in incommunicableness of nature; so wide the distance between creation and Creator! A word which <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07256b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">heretics</font></u></a> may be ashamed to hear. </p>
<p>But wherefore has He chosen us? <q>That we should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without a blemish before Him.</q> That you may not then, when you hear that <q>He has chosen us,</q> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> alone is sufficient, he proceeds to add life and conduct. To this end, says he, has He chosen us, and on this condition, <q>that we should be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and without blemish.</q> And so formerly he chose the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a>. On what terms? <q>This nation, says he, has He chosen from the rest of the nations.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/deu014.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Deuteronomy 14:2</font></u></a></span> Now if men in their choices choose what is best, much more does God. And indeed the fact of their being chosen is at once a token of the loving kindness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and of their moral goodness. For by all means would he have chosen those who were approved. He has Himself rendered us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, but then we must continue <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>. A <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> man is he who is a partaker of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a>; a blameless man is he who leads an irreproachable life. It is not however simply <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> and irreproachableness that He requires, but that we should appear such <q>before Him.</q> For there are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> and blameless characters, who yet are esteemed as such only by men, those who are like whited sepulchres, and like such as wear sheep's clothing. It is not such, however, He requires, but such as the Prophet speaks of; <q>And according to the cleanness of my hands.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa017.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 18:24</font></u></a></span> What cleanness? That which is so <q>in His eyesight.</q> He requires that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holiness</font></u></a> on which the eye of God may look.</p>
<p>Having thus spoken of the good works of these, he again recurs to His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. <q>In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>having <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">predestinated</font></u></a> us.</q> Because this comes not of any pains, nor of any good works of ours, but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>; and yet not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> alone, but of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> also. For if indeed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> alone, it would follow that all must be saved; whereas again were it the result of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> alone, then were His coming needless, and the whole dispensation. But it is the result neither of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> alone, nor yet of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but of both. <q>He chose us,</q> says the Apostle; and He that chooses, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> what it is that He chooses. <q>In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>,</q> he adds, <q>having foreordained us;</q> for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> would never have saved any one, had there not been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. For tell me, what would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> have profited, how would he have exhibited what he has exhibited, if God had not both called him from the beginning, and, in that He loved him, drawn him to Himself? But besides, His vouchsafing us so great privileges, was the effect of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>, not of our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>. Because our being rendered <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtuous</font></u></a>, and believing, and coming near unto Him, even this again was the work of Him that called us Himself, and yet, notwithstanding, it is ours also. But that on our coming near unto Him, He should vouchsafe us so high privileges, as to bring us at once from a state of enmity, to the adoption of children, this is indeed the work of a really transcendent <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Ver. 4, 5. <q>In <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> unto Himself.</q></p>
<p>Do you observe how that nothing is done without Christ? Nothing without the Father? The one has <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">predestinated</font></u></a>, the other has brought us near. And these words he adds by way of heightening the things which have been done, in the same way as he says also elsewhere, <q>And not only so, but we also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">rejoice</font></u></a> in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom005.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 5:11</font></u></a></span> For great indeed are the blessings bestowed, yet are they made far greater in being bestowed through Christ; because He sent not any servant, though it was to servants He sent, but the Only-begotten Son Himself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 5</font></u></a>. <q>According to the good pleasure,</q> he continues, <q>of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>That is to say, because He earnestly willed it. This is, as one might say, His earnest desire. For the word <q>good pleasure</q> every where means the precedent will, for there is also another will. As for example, the first will is that sinners should not perish; the second will is, that, if men become <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wicked</font></u></a>, they shall perish. For surely it is not by necessity that He punishes them, but because He wills it. You may see something of the sort even in the words of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, where he says, <q>I would that all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a> were even as I myself.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co007.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 7:7</font></u></a></span> And again, <q>I desire that the younger <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15617c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">widows</font></u></a> marry, bear children.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti005.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Timothy 5:14</font></u></a></span> By <q>good pleasure</q> then he means the first will, the earnest will, the will accompanied with earnest desire, as in case of us, for I shall not refuse to employ even a somewhat familiar expression, in order to speak with clearness to the simpler sort; for thus we ourselves, to express the intentness of the will, speak of acting according to our resolve. What he means to say then is this, God earnestly aims at, earnestly desires, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>. Wherefore then is it that He so loves us, whence has He such affection? It is of His goodness alone. For <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> itself is the fruit of goodness. And for this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03459a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></u></a>, he says, has He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">predestinated</font></u></a> us to the adoption of children; this being His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>, and the object of His earnest wish, that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> may be displayed. <q>According to the good pleasure of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>,</q> he proceeds,</p>

<p>That the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> may be displayed, he says, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. Now then if for this He has shown <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> to us, to the praise of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, and that He may display His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, let us abide therein. <q>To the praise of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q> What is this? That who should praise Him? That who should glorify Him? That we, that Angels, that Archangels, yea, or the whole creation? And what were that? Nothing. The Divine nature <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> no want. And wherefore then would He have us praise and glorify Him? It is that our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> towards Him may be kindled more fervently within us. He desires nothing we can render; not our service, not our praise, nor any thing else, nothing but our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>; this is His object in every thing He does. And he who praises and marvels at the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> displayed towards himself will thus be more devoted and more earnest.</p>
<p><q>Which He freely bestowed on us,</q> he says. He does not say, <q>Which He has graciously given us,</q> (<span>ἐ</span> <span>χαρίσατο</span>) but, <q>wherein He has shown <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> to us.</q> (<span>ἐ</span> <span>χαρίτωσεν</span>) That is to say, He has not only released us from our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, but has also made us meet objects of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. It is as though one were to take a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09182a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">leper</font></u></a>, wasted by distemper, and disease, by age, and poverty, and famine, and were to turn him all at once into a graceful youth, surpassing all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> in beauty, shedding a bright lustre from his cheeks, and eclipsing the sun-beams with the glances of his eyes; and then were to set him in the very flower of his age, and after that array him in purple and a diadem and all the attire of royalty. It is thus that God has arrayed and adorned this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> of ours, and clothed it with beauty, and rendered it an object of His delight and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a>. Such a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> Angels desire to look into, yea, Archangels, and all the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> ones. Such <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> has He shed over us, so dear has He rendered us to Himself. <q>The King,</q> says the Psalmist, <q>shall greatly desire your beauty.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa044.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 45:11</font></u></a></span> Think what injurious words we uttered heretofore, and look, what gracious words we utter now. Wealth has no longer charms for us, nor the things that are here below, but only heavenly things, the things that are in the heavens. When a child has outward beauty, and has besides a pervading <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> in all its sayings, do we not call it a beautiful child? Such as this are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faithful</font></u></a>. Look, what words the initiated utter! What can be more beautiful than that mouth that breathes those wondrous words, and with a pure heart and pure lips, and beaming with cheerful confidence, partakes of such a mystical table? What more beautiful than the words, with which we renounce the service of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Devil</font></u></a>, and enlist in the service of Christ? Than both that confession which is before the Baptismal laver, and that which is after it? Let us reflect as many of us as have defiled our Baptism, and weep that we may be able again to repair it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse6" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 6</font></u></a>. <q>In the Beloved,</q> he says, <q>in whom we have our redemption through His Blood.</q> </p>
<p>And how is this? Not only is there this marvel, that He has given His Son, but yet further that He has given Him in such a way, as that the Beloved One Himself should be slain!</p>
<p>Yea, and more transcendent still! He has given the Beloved for them that were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>. See, how high a price he sets upon us. If, when we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a> Him and were enemies, He gave the Beloved, what will He not do now, when we are reconciled by Him through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse7" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 7</font></u></a>. <q>The forgiveness,</q> says he, <q>of our trespasses.</q></p>
<p>Again he descends from high to low: first speaking of adoption, and sanctification, and blamelessness, and then of the Passion, and in this not lowering his discourse and bringing it down from greater things to lesser, no rather, he was heightening it, and raising it from the lesser to the greater. For nothing is so great as that the blood of this Son should be shed for us. Greater this than both the adoption, and all the other gifts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, that He spared not even the Son. For great indeed is the forgiveness of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, yet this is the far greater thing, that it should be done by the Lord's blood. For that this is far greater than all, look how here again he exclaims,</p>
<p>Ver. 7, 8. <q>According to the riches of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, which He made to abound toward us.</q></p>
<p>The abovementioned gifts are riches, yet is this far more so. <q>Which,</q> says he, <q>He made to abound toward us.</q> They are both <q>riches</q> and <q>they have abounded,</q> that is to say, were poured forth in ineffable measure. It is not possible to represent in words what blessings we have in fact experienced. For riches indeed they are, abounding riches, and He has given in abundance riches not of man but of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, so that on all hands it is impossible that they should be expressed. And to show us how He gave it to such abundance, he adds,</p>
<p>Ver. 8, 9. <q>In all wisdom and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a>, having made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> unto us the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>That is to say, Making us wise and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudent</font></u></a>, in that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> wisdom, and that which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a>. Strange! What friendship! For He tells us His secrets; the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, says he, of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>, as if one should say, He has made <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">known</font></u></a> to us the things that are in His heart. For here is indeed the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a> which is full of all wisdom and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prudence</font></u></a>. For what will you mention equal to this wisdom! Those that were worth nothing, it has discovered a way of raising them to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> and abundance. What can equal this wise contrivance? He that was an enemy, he that was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hated</font></u></a>, he is in a moment lifted up on high. And not this only—but, yet more, that it should be done at this particular time, this again was the work of wisdom; and that it should be done by means of the Cross. It were matter of long discourse here to point out, how all this was the work of wisdom, and how He had made us wise. And therefore he repeats again the words,</p>
<p><q>According to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him.</q> </p>
<p>That is to say, this He desired, this He travailed for, as one might say, that He might be able to reveal to us the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>. What <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mystery</font></u></a>? That He would have man seated up on high. And this has come to pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 10</font></u></a>. <q>Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times to sum up all things in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, even in Him.</q></p>
<p>Heavenly things, he means to say, had been severed from earthly. They had no longer one Head. So far indeed as the system of the creation went, there was over all One <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, but so far as management of one household went, this, amid the wide spread of Gentile <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">error</font></u></a>, was not the case, but they had been severed from His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obedience</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>Unto a dispensation,</q> says he, <q>of the fullness of the times.</q></p>
<p>The fullness of the times, he calls it. Observe with what nicety he speaks. And whereas he points out the origination, the purpose, the will, the first intention, as proceeding from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, and the fulfillment and execution as effected by the agency of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, yet no where does he apply to him the term minister. </p>
<p><q>He chose us,</q> says he, <q>in Him, having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a> to Himself;</q> and, <q>to the praise of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>, in whom we have redemption through His blood,— which He purposed in Him, unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ;</q> and no where has he called Him minister. If however the word <q>in</q> and the word <q>by</q> implies a mere minister, look what the matter comes to. Just in the very beginning of the Epistle, he used the expression <q>through the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a> of the Father.</q> The Father, he means, willed, the Son wrought. But neither does it follow, that because the Father willed, the Son is excluded from the willing; nor because the Son wrought, that the Father is deprived of the working. But to the Father and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>, all things are common. <q>For all Mine are Yours,</q> says He, <q>and Yours are Mine.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh017.htm#verse10" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 17:10</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>The fullness of the times, however, was His coming. After, then, He had done everything, by the ministry both of Angels, and of Prophets, and of the Law, and nothing came of it, and it was well near come to this, that man had been made in vain, brought into the world in vain, nay, rather to his ruin; when all were absolutely perishing, more fearfully than in the deluge, He devised this dispensation, that is by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>; that it might not be in vain, might not be to no purpose that man was created. This he calls <q>the fullness of the times,</q> and <q>wisdom.</q> And why so? Because at that time when they were on the very point of perishing, then they were rescued.</p>
<p>That <q>He might sum up</q> he says.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this word, <q>sum up?</q> It is <q>to knit together.</q> Let us, however, endeavor to get near the exact import. With ourselves then, in common conversation, the word means the summing into a brief compass things spoken at length, the concise account of matters described in detail. And it has this meaning. For Christ has gathered up in Himself the dispensations carried on through a lengthened period, that is to say, He has cut them short. For <q>by finishing His word and cutting it short in righteousness,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom009.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Romans 9:28</font></u></a></span> He both comprehended former dispensations, and added others beside. This is the meaning of <q>summing up.</q></p>
<p>It has also another signification; and of what nature is this? He has set over all one and the same Head, i.e., Christ according to the flesh, alike over Angels and men. That is to say, He has given to Angels and men one and the same government; to the one the Incarnate, to the other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God the Word</font></u></a>. Just as one might say of a house which has some part decayed and the other sound, He has rebuilt the house, that is to say, He has made it stronger, and laid a firmer foundation. So also here He has brought all under one and the same Head. For thus will an union be effected, thus will a close bond be effected, if one and all can be brought under one and the same Head, and thus have some constraining bond of union from above. Honored then as we are with so great a blessing, so high a privilege, so great loving-kindness, let us not shame our Benefactor, let us not render in vain so great <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. Let us exemplify the life of Angels, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> of Angels, the conversation of Angels, yea, I entreat and conjure you, that all these things turn not to our judgment, nor to our condemnation, but to our enjoyment of those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things, which may God grant we may all attain, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ Jesus</font></u></a>, our Lord, with whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, strength, etc. etc.</p></div>

That point then, which more properly belongs to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">happy</font></u></a> fortune, is the very point he insists upon. For this inheritance by lot depends not on <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>, but, as one might say, on fortuitous circumstances. It is as though he had said, lots were cast, and He has chosen us; but the whole is of deliberate choice. Men <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">predestinated</font></u></a>, that is to say, having chosen them to Himself, He has separated. He saw us, as it were, chosen by lot before we were born. For marvellous is the foreknowledge of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and acquainted with all things before their beginning.</p>
<p>But mark now how on all occasions he takes pains to point out, that it is not the result of any change of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230102.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_4_0_3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">purpose</font></u></a>, but that these <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230102.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">matters</font></u></a> had been thus modeled from the very first, so that we are in no wise inferior to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> in this respect; and how, in consequence, he does every thing with this view. How then is it that Christ Himself says, <q>I was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israel</font></u></a>?</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat015.htm#verse24" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 15:24</font></u></a></span> And said again to his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">disciples</font></u></a>, <q>Go not into any way of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, and enter not into any city of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaritans</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat010.htm#verse5" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 10:5</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> again himself says, <q>It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05551b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">eternal</font></u></a> life, lo, we turn to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act013.htm#verse46" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 13:46</font></u></a></span> These expressions, I say, are used with this design, that no one may suppose that this work came to pass incidentally only. <q>According to the purpose,</q> he says, <q>of Him who works all things after the counsel of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q> That is to say, He had no after workings; having modeled all things from the very first, thus he leads forward all things <q>according to the counsel of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">will</font></u></a>.</q> So that it was not merely because the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jews</font></u></a> did not listen that He called the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gentiles</font></u></a>, nor was it of mere necessity, nor was it on any inducement arising from them.</p>
<p>Ver. 12, 13. <q>To the end that we should be unto the praise of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, we who had before hoped in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>. In whom you also having heard the word of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>That is to say, through whom. Observe how he on all occasions speaks of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, as the Author of all things, and in no case gives Him the title of a subordinate agent, or a minister. And so again, elsewhere, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, he says, <q>that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, having of old time spoken unto the Fathers in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, has at the end of these days spoken unto us in His Son,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb001.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 1:1</font></u></a></span> that is <q>through</q> His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Son</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>The word of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truth</font></u></a>,</q> he says, no longer that of the type, nor of the image.</p>
<p><q>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>.</q> And well does he call it the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, intimating in the one word a contrast to the law, in the other, a contrast with punishment to come. For what is the message, but the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Gospel</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, which forbears to destroy those that are worthy of destruction.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 14</font></u></a>. <q>In whom having also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, you were sealed with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> of promise, which is an earnest of our inheritance.</q></p>
<p>Here again, the word <q>sealed,</q> is an indication of special forecast. He does not speak of our being <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">predestinated</font></u></a> only, nor of our being allotted, but further, of our being sealed. For just as though one were to make those who should fall to his lot manifest, so also did God separate them for believing, and sealed them for the allotment of the things to come.</p>
<p>You see how, in process of time, He makes them objects of wonder. So long as they were in His foreknowledge, they were manifest to no one, but when they were sealed, they became manifest, though not in the same way as we are; for they will be manifest except a few. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a> also were sealed, but that was by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">circumcision</font></u></a>, like the brutes and reasonless creatures. We too are sealed, but it is as sons, <q>with the Spirit.</q></p>
<p>But what is meant by, <q>with the Spirit of promise?</q> Doubtless it means that we have received that Spirit according to promise. For there are two promises, the one by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prophets</font></u></a>, the other from the Son.</p>
<p>By the Prophets.— Hearken to the words of Joel; <q>I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joe002.htm#verse28" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Joel 2:28</font></u></a></span> And hearken again to the words of Christ; <q>But you shall receive power, when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a> has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08544a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Judea</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13416a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Samaria</font></u></a>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act001.htm#verse8" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 1:8</font></u></a></span> And <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">truly</font></u></a>, the Apostle means, He ought, as <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, to have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>; however, he does not ground his affirmation upon this, but examines it like a case where man is concerned, speaking much as he does in the Epistle to the Hebrews; <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb006.htm#verse18" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 6:18</font></u></a></span> where he says, <q>That by two immutable things in which it was impossible for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> to lie, we may have a strong encouragement.</q> Thus here also he makes the things already bestowed a sure token of the promise of those which are yet to come. For this reason he further calls it an <q>earnest,</q> <span>Cf. also <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co001.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 1:22</font></u></a></span> for an earnest is a part of the whole. He has purchased what we are most concerned in, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>; and has given us an earnest in the mean while. Why then did He not give the whole at once? Because neither have we, on our part, done the whole of our work. We have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>. This is a beginning; and He too on His part has given an earnest. When we show our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faith</font></u></a> by our works, then He will add the rest. Nay, more, He has given yet another pledge, His own blood, and has promised another still. In the same way as in case of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> between nation and nation they give hostages: just so has God also given His Son as a pledge of peace and solemn treaties, and, further, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a> also which is from Him. For they, that are indeed partakers of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that He is the earnest of our inheritance. Such an one was <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a>, who already had here a foretaste of the blessings there. And this is why he was so eager, and yearned to be released from things below, and groaned within himself. He transferred his whole mind there, and saw every thing with different eyes. You have no part in the reality, and therefore failest to understand the description. Were we all partakers of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, as we ought to be partakers, then should we behold <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, and the order of things that is there.</p>
<p>It is an earnest, however, of what? Of</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 14</font></u></a>. <q>The redemption of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>'s own possession.</q></p>
<p>For our absolute redemption takes place then. For now we have our life in the world, we are liable to many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> accidents, and are living among ungodly men. But our absolute redemption will be then, when there shall be no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> sufferings, when we shall not be indiscriminately mixed with all kinds of people.</p>
<p>At present, however, there is but an earnest, because at present we are far distant from these blessings. Yet is our citizenship not upon earth; even now we are out of the pale of the things that are here below. Yes, we are sojourners even now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph001.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ver. 14</font></u></a>. <q>Unto the praise of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>This he adds in immediate connection. And why? Because it would serve to give those who heard it full assurance. Were it for our sake only, he means to say, that God did this, there might be some room for misgiving. But if it be for His own sake, and in order to display His goodness, he assigns, as a sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15677a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">witness</font></u></a>, a reason why these things never possibly could be otherwise. We find the same language everywhere applied to the case of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08193a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Israelites</font></u></a>. <q>Do Thou this for us for Your Name's sake;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa108.htm#verse21" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 109:21</font></u></a></span> and again, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> Himself said, <q>I do it for My own sake;</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/isa048.htm#verse11" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Isaiah 48:11</font></u></a></span> and so <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Moses</font></u></a>, <q>Do it, if for nothing else, yet for the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of Your Name.</q> This gives those who hear it full assurance; it relieves them to be told, that whatever He promises, for His own goodness' sake He will most surely perform.</p>
<p>Moral. Let not the hearing, however, make us too much at our ease; for although He does it for His own sake, yet notwithstanding He requires a duty on our part. If He says, <q>Them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> Me I will <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1sa002.htm#verse30" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Samuel 2:30</font></u></a></span> let us reflect that there is that which He requires of us also. True, it is the praise of His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> to save those that are enemies, but those who, after being made friends, continue His friends. So that if they were to return back to their former state of enmity, all were vain and to no purpose. There is not another Baptism, nor is there a second reconciliation again, but <q>a certain fearful expectation of judgment which shall devour the adversaries.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb010.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 10:27</font></u></a></span> If we intend at the same time to be always at enmity with Him and yet to claim forgiveness at His hand, we shall never cease to be at enmity, and to be wanton, to grow in depravity, and to be blind to the Sun of Righteousness which has risen. Do you not see the ray that shall open your eyes? Render them then good and sound and quicksighted. He has showed you the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">true</font></u></a> light; if you shun it, and runnest back again into the darkness, what shall be your excuse? What sort of allowance shall be made for you? None from that moment. For this is a mark of unspeakable enmity. When indeed you knew not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, then if you were at enmity with Him, you had, be it how it might, some excuse. But when you have tasted the goodness and the honey, if you again abandonest them, and turnest to your own vomit, what else are you doing but bringing forward evidence of excessive <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07149b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hatred</font></u></a> and contempt? 'Nay,' you will say, 'but I am constrained to it by nature. I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Christ indeed, but I am constrained by nature.' If you are under the power and force of constraint, you will have allowance made; but if you yield from indolence, not for a moment.</p>
<p>Now then, come, let us examine this very question, whether <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> are the effect of force and constraint, or of indolence and great carelessness. The law says, <q>You shall not kill.</q> What sort of force, what sort of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, is there here? Violence indeed must one use to force himself to kill, for who among us would as a matter of choice plunge his sword into the throat of his neighbor, and stain his hand with blood? Not one. You see then that, on the contrary, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is more properly matter of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> and constraint. For God has implanted in our nature a charm, which binds us to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> one another. <q>Every beast (it says) loves his like, and every man loves his neighbor.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/sir013.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Sirach 13:15</font></u></a></span> Do you see that we have from our nature seeds which tend to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a>; whereas those of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> are contrary to nature? And if these latter predominate, this is but an evidence of our exceeding indolence.</p>
<p>Again, what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a>? What sort of necessity is there to bring us to this? Doubtless, it will be said, the tyranny of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">lust</font></u></a>. But why, tell me, should this be? What, is it not in every one's power to have his own wife, and thus to put a stop to this tyranny? True, he will say, but a sort of passion for my neighbor's wife seizes hold on me. Here the question is no longer one of necessity. Passion is no matter of necessity, no one loves of necessity, but of deliberate choice and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">free will</font></u></a>. Indulgence of nature, indeed, is perhaps matter of necessity, but to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> one <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15687b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">woman</font></u></a> rather than another is no matter of necessity. Nor is the point with you natural desire, but vanity, and wantonness, and unbounded licentiousness. For which is according to reason, that a man should have an espoused wife, and her the mother of his children, or one not acknowledged? Do you not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> that it is intimacy that breeds attachment. This, therefore, is not the fault of nature. Blame not natural desire. Natural desire was bestowed with a view to marriage; it was given with a view to the procreation of children, not with a view to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">adultery</font></u></a> and corruption. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09053a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">laws</font></u></a>, too, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> how to make allowance for those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> which are of necessity,— or rather nothing is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> when it arises from necessity but all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> rises from wantonness. God has not so framed man's nature as that he should have any necessity to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, since were this the case, there would be no such thing as punishment. We ourselves exact no account of things done of necessity and by constraint, much less would <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, so full of mercy and loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Again, what is stealing? Is it matter of necessity? Yes, a man will say, because poverty causes this. Poverty, however, rather compels us to work, not to steal. Poverty, therefore, has in fact the contrary effect. Theft is the effect of idleness; whereas poverty produces usually not idleness, but a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> of labor. So that this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a> is the effect of indolence, as you may learn from hence. Which, I ask, is the more difficult, the more distasteful, to wander about at night without sleep, to break open houses, and walk about in the dark, and to have one's life in one's hand, and to be always prepared for <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07441a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">murder</font></u></a>, and to be shivering and dead with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a>; or to be attending to one's daily task, in full enjoyment of safety and security? This last is the easier task; and it is because this is easier, that the majority practise it rather than the other. You see then that it is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">virtue</font></u></a> which is according to nature, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">vice</font></u></a> which is against nature, in the same way as disease and health are.</p>
<p>What, again, are <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05781a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">falsehood</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11696a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">perjury</font></u></a>? What necessity can they possibly imply? None whatever, nor any compulsion; it is a matter to which we proceed voluntarily. We are distrusted, it will be said. True, distrusted we are, because we choose it. For we might, if we would, be trusted more upon our character, than upon our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>. Why, tell me, is it that we do not trust some, no, not on their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, while we deem others trustworthy even independently of oaths. Do you see that there is no need of oaths in any case? 'When such an one speaks,' we say, 'I <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a> him, even without any <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, but you, no, not with your oaths.' Thus then an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a> is unnecessary; and is in fact an evidence rather of distrust than of confidence. For where a man is over ready to take his <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, he does not leave us to entertain any great idea of his scrupulousness. So that the man who is most constant in his use of oaths, has on no occasion any necessity for using one, and he who never uses one on any occasion, has in himself the full benefit of its use. Some one says there is a necessity for an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11176a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">oath</font></u></a>, to produce confidence; but we see that they are the more readily trusted who abstain from taking oaths.</p>
<p>But again, if one is a man of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>, is this a matter of necessity? Yes, he will say, because his passion carries him away, and burns within him, and does not let the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> be at rest. Man, to act with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> is not the effect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, but of littleness of mind. Were it the effect of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>, all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">men</font></u></a>, whenever they were <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angry</font></u></a>, would never cease committing acts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a>. We have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> given us, not that we may commit acts of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15446a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">violence</font></u></a> on our neighbors, but that we may correct those that are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, that we may bestir ourselves, that we may not be sluggish. Anger is implanted in us as a sort of sting, to make us gnash with our teeth against the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>, to make us vehement against him, not to set us in array against each other. We have arms, not to make us at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15546c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">war</font></u></a> among ourselves, but that we may employ our whole armor against the enemy. Are you prone to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a>? Be so against your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>: chastise your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, scourge your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>, be a severe judge, and merciless in your sentence against your own <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a>. This is the way to turn <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01489a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">anger</font></u></a> to account. It was for this that God implanted it within us.</p>
<p>But again, is plunder a matter of necessity? No, in no wise. Tell me, what manner of necessity is there to be grasping: what manner of compulsion? Poverty, a man will say, causes it, and the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> of being without common necessaries. Now this is the very reason why you ought not to be grasping. Wealth so gotten has no security in it. You are doing the very same thing as a man would do, who, if he were asked why he laid the foundation of his house in the sand, should say, he did it because of the frost and rain. Whereas this would be the very reason why he should not lay it in the sand. They are the very foundations which the rain, and blasts, and wind, most quickly overturn. So that if you would be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>, never be rapacious; if you would transmit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> to your children, get righteous <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>, at least, if any there be that is such. Because this abides, and remains firm, whereas that which is not such, quickly wastes and perishes. Tell me, have you a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a> to be rich, and do you take the goods of others? Surely this is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> consists in possessing what is your own. He that is in possession of the goods of others, never can be a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a> man; since at that rate even your very silk venders, who receive their goods as a consignment from others, would be the wealthiest and the richest of men. Though for the time, indeed, it is theirs, still we do not call them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>. And why forsooth? Because they are in possession of what belongs to others. For though the piece itself happens to be theirs, still the money it is worth is not theirs. Nay, and even if the money is in their hands, still this is not <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a>. Now, if consignments thus given render not men more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a> because we so soon resign them, how can those which arise from rapine render them <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>? However, if at any rate you desire to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealthy</font></u></a>, (for the matter is not one of necessity,) what greater good is it that you would fain enjoy? Is it a longer life? Yet, surely men of this character quickly become short-lived. Oftentimes they pay as the penalty of plunder and rapaciousness, an untimely death; and not only suffer as a penalty the loss of the enjoyment of their gains, but go out of life having gained but little, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> to boot. Oftentimes too they die of diseases, which are the fruits of self-indulgence, and of toil, and of anxiety. Fain would I understand why it is that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> is so eagerly pursued by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a>. Why surely for this reason has God set a limit and a boundary to our nature, that we may have no need to go on seeking <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15571a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">wealth</font></u></a> beyond it. For instance He has commanded us, to clothe the body in one, or perhaps in two garments; and there is no need of any more to cover us. Where is the good of ten thousand changes of raiment, and those moth-eaten? The stomach has its appointed bound, and any thing given beyond this, will of necessity destroy the whole man. Where then is the use of your herds, and flocks, and cutting up of flesh? We require but one roof to shelter us. Where then is the use of your vast ground-plots, and costly buildings? Do you strip the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12327a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">poor</font></u></a>, that vultures and jackdaws may have where to dwell? And what a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> do not these things deserve? Many are frequently raising edifices that glisten with pillars and costly marbles, in places which they never so much as saw. What scheme is there indeed that they have not adopted? Yet neither themselves reap the benefit, nor any one else. The desolateness does not allow them to get away there; and yet not even thus do they desist. You see that these things are not done for profit's-sake, but in all these cases folly, and absurdity, and vainglory, is the motive. And this, I beseech you to avoid, that we may be enabled to avoid also every other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>, and may obtain those <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things which are promised to them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">love</font></u></a> Him, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, with whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, strength, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a> forever. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p>

<p><q>I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>What is your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>, and what your entreaty? It is</p>
<p><q>That the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, the Father of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</q> Two things he requires them to understand, as it is their duty to understand them; to what <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/230103.htm#" name="MIVA_LINK_3_0_2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">blessings</font></u></a> they are called, and how they have been released from their former state. He says, however, himself, that these points are three. How then are they three? In order that we may understand touching the things to come; for from the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">good</font></u></a> things laid up for us, we shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His ineffable and surpassing riches, and from understanding who we were, and how we <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a>, we shall <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> His power and sovereignty, in turning again to Himself those who had been so long time estranged from Him, <q>For the weakness of God is stronger than men.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co001.htm#verse25" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 1:25</font></u></a></span> Inasmuch as it is by the self-same power by which He raised Christ from the dead, that He has also drawn us to Himself. Nor is that power limited to the resurrection, but far exceeds it.</p>
<p>Ver. 21, 22. <q>And made Him to sit at His right hand, in the Heavenly places, far above all rule and authority, and power and dominion, and every name that is named: and He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills all in all.</q></p>
<p>Vast indeed are the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> and secrets of which He has made us partakers. And these it is not possible for us to understand otherwise than by being partakers of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Ghost</font></u></a>, and by receiving abundant <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a>. And it is for this reason that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>. <q>The Father of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q> that is, He that has given us vast blessings, for he constantly addresses Him according to the subject he is upon, as, for instance, when he says, <q>The Father of mercies and God of all comfort.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/2co001.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">2 Corinthians 1:3</font></u></a></span> And, again, the Prophet says, <q>The Lord is my strength and my might.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa017.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 18:1</font></u></a></span></p>
<p><q>The Father of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>He has no name by which he may represent these things, and on all occasions calls them <q><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q> which is in fact, with us, the name and appellation of every kind of magnificence. Mark, he says, the Father of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; <span>cf.<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act007.htm#verse2" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 7:2</font></u></a></span> but of Christ the God. What then? Is the Son inferior to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>? No, there is no one, not even a maniac, would say so.</p>
<p><q>May give unto you,</q></p>
<p>That is, may raise and wing your understanding, for it is not possible otherwise to understand these things. <q>For the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit of God</font></u></a>; for they are foolishness unto him.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co002.htm#verse14" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 2:14</font></u></a></span> So then, there is need of spiritual <q>wisdom,</q> that we may perceive things spiritual, that we may see things hidden. That Spirit <q>reveals</q> all things. He is going to set forth the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Now the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, the Spirit alone comprehends, who also searches the deep things of Him. It is not said, <q>that Angel, or Archangel, or any other created power, may give,</q> that is, confer upon you a spiritual gift. And if this be of revelation, then is the discovery of arguments consequently vain. For he that has learned <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knows</font></u></a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, shall no longer dispute concerning any thing. He will not say, This is impossible, and That is possible, and How did the other thing come to pass? If we learn <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>, as we ought to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> Him; if we learn God from Him from whom we ought to learn Him, that is from the Spirit Himself; then shall we no longer dispute concerning any thing. And hence it is that he says,</p>
<p><q>Having the eyes of your heart enlightened in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of Him.</q> </p>
<p>He that has learned what God is, will have no misgiving about His promises, and disbelief about what has been already brought to pass. He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prays</font></u></a>, then, that there may be given them <q>a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</q> Yet still he also establishes it, as far as he can himself, by arguments, and from <q>already</q> existing facts. For, whereas he was about to mention some things which had already come to pass, and others which had not as yet happened; he makes those which have been brought to pass, a pledge of those which have not: in some such way, I mean, as this,</p>
<p><q>That you may <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>what is the hope of His calling.</q></p>
<p>It is as yet, he means, hidden, but not so to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05769a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">faithful</font></u></a>.</p>
<p><q>And,</q> again, <q>what is the riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His inheritance in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a>.</q> </p>
<p>This too is as yet hidden.</p>
<p>But what is clear? That through His power we have <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believed</font></u></a> that He has raised Christ. For to persuade <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>, is a thing far more miraculous than to raise a dead body. I will endeavor to make this clear. Hearken then. Christ said to the dead, <q>Lazarus, come forth,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh011.htm#verse43" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">John 11:43</font></u></a></span> and straightway he <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">obeyed</font></u></a>. Peter said, <q>Tabitha, arise,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/act009.htm#verse40" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Acts 9:40</font></u></a></span> and she did not refuse. He Himself shall speak the word at the last day, and all shall rise, and that so quickly, that <q>they which are yet alive, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1th004.htm#verse15" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Thessalonians 4:15</font></u></a></span> and all shall come to pass, all run together <q>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co015.htm#verse52" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 15:52</font></u></a></span> But in the matter of believing, it is not thus, but how is it? Hearken then to Him again, how He says, <q>How often would I have gathered your children together, and you would not.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/mat023.htm#verse37" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Matthew 23:37</font></u></a></span> You perceive that this last is the more difficult. Accordingly, it is upon this that he builds up the whole argument; because by <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">human</font></u></a> calculations it is far more difficult to influence the choice, than to work upon nature. And the reason is this, it is because He would thus have us become good of our own will. Thus with good reason does he say, </p>
<p><q>The exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Yes, when Prophets had availed nothing, nor Angels, nor Archangels, when the whole creation, both visible and invisible, had failed, (the visible lying before us, and without any power to guide us, and much also which is invisible,) then He ordered His own coming, to show us that it was a matter which required Divine power.</p>
<p><q>The riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>,</q></p>
<p>That is, the unutterable <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>; for what language shall be adequate to express that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of which the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">saints</font></u></a> shall then be partakers? None. But verily there is need of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">grace</font></u></a> in order that the understanding may perceive it, and admit even so much as at least one little ray. Some things indeed they <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knew</font></u></a> even before; now he was desirous that they should learn more, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">know</font></u></a> it more clearly. Do you see how great things He has wrought? He has raised up Christ. Is this a small thing? But look again. He has set Him at His right hand. And shall any language then be able to represent this? Him that is of the earth, more mute than the fishes, and made the sport of devils, He has in a moment raised up on high. Truly this is indeed the <q>exceeding greatness of His power.</q> And behold, whither He has raised Him.</p>
<p><q>In the heavenly places;</q></p>
<p>He has made Him far above all created nature, far above all rule and authority.</p>
<p><q>Far above all rule,</q> he says.</p>
<p>Need then indeed is there of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Spirit</font></u></a>, of an understanding wise in the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">knowledge</font></u></a> of Him. Need then is there indeed of revelation. Reflect, how vast is the distance between the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">nature</font></u></a> of man and of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. Yet from this vile estate has He exalted Him to that high dignity. Nor does He mount by degrees, first one step, then another, then a third. Amazing! He does not simply say, <q>above,</q> but, <q>far above;</q> for God is above those powers which are above. And there then has He raised Him, Him that is one of us, brought Him from the lowest point to the supremest sovereignty, to that beyond which there is no other <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. Above <q>all</q> principality, he says, not, i.e., over one and not over another, but over all,</p>
<p><q>Rule and authority and power, and dominion, and every name that is named.</q></p>
<p>Whatever there be in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07170a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Heaven</font></u></a>, He has become above all. And this is said of Him that was raised from the dead which is worthy of our admiration; for of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God the Word</font></u></a>, it cannot possibly be, because what insects are in comparison of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, this the whole creation is in comparison of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. If all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mankind</font></u></a> are to be counted as spittle and were counted as the turn of a balance, consider the invisible powers as insects. But of Him that was one of us, this is great and surprising indeed. For He raised Him up from the very lowest parts of the earth. If all the nations are as a drop, how small a portion then of that drop is a single man! Yet Him has He made higher than all things, <q>not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</q> Therefore powers there are whose names are to us unintelligible, and unknown.</p>
<p><q>And He put all things in subjection under His feet.</q></p>
<p>Not simply so set Him above them as to be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> above them, nor by way of comparison with them, but so that He should sit over them as His slaves. Amazing! Awful indeed are these things; every created power has been made the slave of man by reason of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God the Word</font></u></a> dwelling in Him. For it is possible for a man to be above others, without having others in subjection, but only as preferred before them. But here it is not so. No, <q>He put all things in subjection under His feet.</q> And not simply put them in subjection, but in the most abject subjection, that below which there can be none. Therefore he adds, <q>under His feet.</q></p>
<p><q>And gave Him to be Head over all things to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q></p>
<p>Amazing again, whither has He raised the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>? As though he were lifting it up by some engine, he has raised it up to a vast height, and set it on yonder throne; for where the Head is, there is the body also. There is no interval to separate between the Head and the body; for were there a separation, then were it no longer a body, then were it no longer a head. <q>Over all things,</q> he says. What is meant by <q>over all things?</q> He has suffered neither Angel nor Archangel nor any other being to be above Him. But not only in this way has He <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> us, in exalting that which is of ourselves, but also in that He has prepared the whole race in common to follow Him, to cling to Him, to accompany His train.</p>
<p><q>Which is His body.</q></p>
<p>In order then that when you hear of the Head you may not conceive the notion of supremacy only, but also of consolidation, and that you may behold Him not as supreme Ruler only, but as Head of a body.</p>
<p><q>The fullness of Him that fills all in all</q> he says.</p>
<p>As though this were not sufficient to show the close connection and relationship, what does he add? <q>The fullness of Christ is the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>.</q> And rightly, for the complement of the head is the body, and the complement of the body is the head. Mark what great arrangement <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11567b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Paul</font></u></a> observes, how he spares not a single word, that he may represent the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>. <q>The, complement,</q> he says, i.e., the head is, as it were, filled up by the body, because the body is composed and made up of all its several parts, and he introduces Him as having need of each single one and not only of all in common and together; for unless we be many, and one be the hand, and another the foot, and another some other member, the whole body is not filled up. It is by all then that His body is filled up. Then is the head filled up, then is the body rendered perfect, when we are all knit together and united. Perceivest thou then the <q>riches of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a> of His inheritance? The exceeding greatness of His power towards them that <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">believe</font></u></a>? The hope of your calling?</q></p>
<p>Moral. Let us reverence our Head, let us reflect of what a Head we are the body—a Head, to whom all things are put in subjection. According to this representation we ought to be better, yea, than the very <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">angels</font></u></a>, and greater than the Archangels, in that we have been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> above them all. God <q>took not hold of Angels,</q> as he says in writing to the Hebrews, <q>but He took hold of the seed of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Abraham</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb002.htm#verse16" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Hebrews 2:16</font></u></a></span> He took hold of neither principality nor power, nor dominion, nor any other authority, but He took up our nature, and made it to sit on His right hand. And why do I say, has made it sit? He has made it His garment, and not only so, but has put all things in subjection under His feet. How many sorts of death do you suppose? How many <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a>? Ten thousand? Yea, and ten thousand times told, but nothing equal to it will you mention. Two things He has done, the greatest things. He has both Himself descended to the lowest depth of humiliation, and has raised up man to the height of exaltation. He saved him by His blood. He spoke of the former first, how that He so greatly humbled Himself. He speaks now of what is stronger than that— a great thing, the crown of all. Surely, even had we been counted worthy of nothing, it were enough. Or, had we been counted worthy even of this <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, it were enough, without the slaying of the Son. But where there are the two, what power of language must it not transcend and surpass? The very resurrection is not great, when I reflect on these things. It is of Him that he says, <q>The God of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">our Lord Jesus Christ</font></u></a>,</q> not of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God the Word</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>Let us feel awed at the closeness of our relation, let us dread lest any one should be cut off from this body, lest any one should fall from it, lest any one should appear unworthy of it. If any one were to place a diadem about our head, a crown of gold, should we not do every thing that we might seem worthy of the lifeless jewels? But now it is not a diadem that is about our head, but, what is far greater, Christ is made our very Head, and yet we pay no regard to it. Yet Angels reverence that Head, and Archangels, and all those powers above. And shall we, which are His body, be awed neither on the one account nor the other? And what then shall be our hope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? Conceive to yourself the royal throne, conceive the excess of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>. This, at least if we chose, might more avail to startle us, yea, even than <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> itself. For, even though <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">hell</font></u></a> were not, that we having been <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honored</font></u></a> with such an <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, should be found base and unworthy of it, what punishment, what vengeance must not this carry with it? Think near whom your Head is seated, (this single consideration is amply sufficient for any purpose whatever,) on whose right hand He is placed, far above all principality, and power, and might. Yet is the body of this Head trampled on by the very devils. Nay, God forbid it should be thus; for were it thus, such a body could be His body no longer. Your own head the more respectable of your servants reverence, and do you subject your body to be the sport of them that insult it? How sore punishment then shall you not deserve? If a man should bind the feet of the emperor with bonds and fetters, will he not be liable to the extremity of punishment? Do you expose the whole body to fierce monsters, and not shudder?</p>
<p>However, since our discourse is concerning the Lord's body, come, and let us turn our thoughts to it, even that which was crucified, which was nailed, which is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>. If you are the body of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, bear the Cross, for He bore it: bear spitting, bear buffetings, bear nails. Such was that Body; that Body <q>did no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sin</font></u></a>, neither was guile found in His mouth.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1pe002.htm#verse22" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Peter 2:22</font></u></a></span> His hands did every thing for the benefit of them that needed, His mouth uttered not a word of those things which are not convenient. He heard them say, <q>You have a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">devil</font></u></a>,</q> and He answered nothing.</p>
<p>Further, our discourse is concerning this Body, and as many of us as partake of that Body and taste of that Blood, are partaking of that which is in no wise different from that Body, nor separate. Consider that we taste of that Body that sits above, that is adored by Angels, that is next to the Power that is incorruptible. Alas! How many ways to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> are open to us! He has made us His own body, He has imparted to us His own body, and yet not one of these things turns us away from what is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a>. Oh the darkness, the depth of the abyss, the apathy! <q>Set your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></u></a>,</q> says he, <q>on the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">God</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/col003.htm#verse1" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Colossians 3:1</font></u></a></span> And after all this, some set their affections upon money, or licentiousness, others are carried captive by their <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11534a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">passions</font></u></a>!</p>
<p>Do you not see, that even in our own body, when any part is superfluous and useless, it is cut off, is cut away? It is of no use that it has belonged to the body, when it is mutilated, when it is mortified, when it is decayed, when it is detrimental to the rest. Let us not then be too confident, because we have been once made members of this body. If this body of ours, though but a natural body, nevertheless suffers amputation, what dreadful <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> shall it not undergo, if the moral principle should fail? When the body partakes not of this natural food, when the pores are stopped up, then it mortifies; when the ducts are closed, then it is palsied. So is it with us also, when we stop our ears, our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> becomes palsied; when we partake not of the spiritual food, when, instead of corrupt bodily humors, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">evil</font></u></a> dispositions impair us, all these things engender disease, dangerous disease, disease that wastes. And then there will be need of that fire, there will be need of that cutting asunder. For Christ cannot endure that we should enter into the bride-chamber with such a body as this. If He led away, and cast out the man that was clothed in filthy garments, what will He not do unto the man who attaches filth to the body; how will He not dispose of him?</p>
<p>I observe many partaking of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ's</font></u></a> Body lightly and just as it happens, and rather from custom and form, than consideration and understanding. When, says a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">man</font></u></a>, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> season of Lent sets in, whatever a man may be, he partakes of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, or, when the day of the Lord's Epiphany comes. And yet it is not the Epiphany, nor is it Lent, that makes a fit time for approaching, but it is sincerity and purity of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>. With this, approach at all times; without it, never. <q>For as often,</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co011.htm#verse26" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">1 Corinthians 11:26</font></u></a></span> says he, <q>as you do this, you proclaim the Lord's death,</q> i.e., <q>you make a remembrance of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a> that has been wrought for you, and of the benefits which I have bestowed.</q> Consider those who partook of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifices</font></u></a> under the old Covenant, how great abstinence did they practise? How did they not conduct themselves? What did they not perform? They were always purifying themselves. And do you, when you draw near to a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a>, at which the very Angels tremble, do you measure the matter by the revolutions of seasons? And how shall you present yourself before the judgment-seat of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, thou who presumest upon His body with polluted hands and lips? You would not presume to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kiss</font></u></a> a king with an unclean mouth, and the King of heaven do you <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">kiss</font></u></a> with an unclean <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? It is an outrage. Tell me, would you choose to come to the Sacrifice with unwashen hands? No, I suppose, not. But you would rather choose not to come at all, than come with soiled hands. And then, thus scrupulous as you are in this little matter, do you come with soiled <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>, and thus dare to touch it? And yet the hands hold it but for a time, whereas into the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a> it is dissolved entirely. What, do you not see the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a> vessels so thoroughly cleansed all over, so resplendent? Our <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">souls</font></u></a> ought to be purer than they, more <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">holy</font></u></a>, more brilliant. And why so? Because those vessels are made so for our sakes. They partake not of Him that is in them, they perceive Him not. But we do—yes, verily. Now then, you would not choose to make use of a soiled vessel, and do you approach with a soiled <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">soul</font></u></a>? Observe the vast inconsistency of the thing. At the other times you come not, no, not though often you are clean; but at <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Easter</font></u></a>, however flagrant an act you may have committed, you come. Oh! The force of custom and of prejudice! In vain is the daily Sacrifice, in vain do we stand before the Altar; there is no one to partake. These things I am saying, not to induce you to partake any how, but that you should render yourselves worthy to partake. Are you not worthy of the Sacrifice, nor of the participation? If so, then neither are you of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayer</font></u></a>. You hear the herald, standing, and saying, <q>As many as are in penitence, all <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>.</q> As many as do not partake, are in penitence. If you are one of those that are in penitence, you ought not to partake; for he that partakes not, is one of those that are in penitence. Why then does he say, <q>Depart, you that are not qualified to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a>,</q> while you have the effrontery to stand still? But no, you are not of that number, you are of the number of those who are qualified to partake, and yet art indifferent about it, and regardest the matter as nothing.</p>
<p>Look, I entreat: a royal table is set before you, Angels minister at that table, the King Himself is there, and do you stand gaping? Are your garments defiled, and yet do you make no account of it?— or are they clean? Then fall down and partake. Every day He comes in to see the guests, and converses with them all. Yes, at this moment is he speaking to your <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04268a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">conscience</font></u></a>; <q>Friends, how are you standing here, not having on a wedding garment?</q> He said not, Why did you sit down? No, before he sat down, He declared him to be unworthy, so much as to come in. He says not, <q>Why did you sit down to eat,</q> but, <q>Why did you come in?</q> And these are the words that He is at this very moment addressing to one and all of us that stand here with such shameless effrontery. For every one, that partakes not of the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, is standing here in shameless effrontery. It is for this reason, that they which are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sins</font></u></a> are first of all put forth; for just as when a master is present at his table, it is not right that those servants who have offended him should be present, but they are sent out of the way: just so also here when the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrifice</font></u></a> is brought forth, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Christ</font></u></a>, the Lord's sheep, is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13309a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">sacrificed</font></u></a>; when you hear the words, <q>Let us <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">pray</font></u></a> together,</q> when you behold the curtains drawn up, then <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07672a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">imagine</font></u></a> that the Heavens are let down from above, and that the Angels are descending!</p>
<p>As then it is not meet that any one of the uninitiated be present, so neither is it that one of them that are initiated, and yet at the same time defiled. Tell me, suppose any one were invited to a feast, and were to wash his hands, and sit down, and be all ready at the table, and after all refuse to partake; is he not insulting the man who invited him? Were it not better for such an one never to have come at all? Now it is just in the same way that you have come here. You have sung the Hymn with the rest: you have declared yourself to be of the number of them that are Worthy, by not departing with them that are unworthy. Why stay, and yet not partake of the table? I am unworthy, you will say. Then are you also unworthy of that communion you have had in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>. For it is not by means of the offerings only, but also by means of those canticles that the Spirit descends all around. Do we not see our own servants, first scouring the table with a sponge, and cleaning the house, and then setting out the entertainment? This is what is done by the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">prayers</font></u></a>, by the cry of the herald. We scour the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Church</font></u></a>, as it were, with a sponge, that all things may be set out in a pure church, that there may be <q>neither spot nor wrinkle.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/eph005.htm#verse27" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Ephesians 5:27</font></u></a></span> Unworthy, indeed, both our eyes of these sights, and unworthy are our ears! <q>And if even a beast,</q> it is said, <q>touch the mountain, it shall be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14308a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">stoned</font></u></a>.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo019.htm#verse13" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Exodus 19:13</font></u></a></span> Thus then they were not worthy so much as to set foot on it, and yet afterwards they both came near, and beheld where God had stood. And you may, afterwards, come near, and behold: when, however, He is present, depart. You are no more allowed to be here than the Catechumen is. For it is not at all the same thing never to have reached the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">mysteries</font></u></a>, and when you have reached them, to stumble at them and despise them, and to make yourself unworthy of this thing. One might enter upon more points, and those more awful still; not however to burden your understanding, these will suffice. They who are not brought to their right senses with these, certainly will not be with more.</p>
<p>That I may not then be the means of increasing your condemnation, I entreat you, not to forbear coming, but to render yourselves worthy both of being present, and of approaching. Tell me, were any king to give command and to say, <q>If any man does this, let him partake of my table;</q> say, would ye not do all you could to be admitted? He has invited us to heaven, to the table of the great and wonderful King, and do we shrink and hesitate, instead of hastening and running to it? And what then is our hope of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>? We cannot lay the blame on our weakness; we cannot on our nature. It is indolence and nothing else that renders us unworthy.</p>
<p>So far have I spoken of myself. But may He that pricks the heart, He that gives the Spirit of compunction, pierce your hearts, and plant the seeds in the depth of them, that so through His <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> ye may conceive, and bring forth the spirit of <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">salvation</font></u></a>, and come near with boldness. For, <q>your children,</q> it is said, <q>are like olive plants round about your table.</q> <span><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/psa127.htm#verse3" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Psalm 128:3</font></u></a></span> O, then, let there be nothing old, nothing wild, nothing harsh. For of such sort are the young plants that are fit for fruit, for the beautiful fruit, fruit I mean of the olive-tree. And thriving they are, so as all to be round about the table, and come together here, not in vain or by chance, but with <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></u></a> and reverence. For thus shall you behold with boldness even Christ Himself in heaven, and shall be counted worthy of that heavenly kingdom, which may God grant we may all attain, in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Jesus Christ</font></u></a>, our Lord with whom to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Father</font></u></a>, together with the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Holy Spirit</font></u></a>, be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">glory</font></u></a>, might, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">honor</font></u></a>, now and ever, and for ages of ages. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm" rel="nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">Amen</font></u></a>.</p></div>

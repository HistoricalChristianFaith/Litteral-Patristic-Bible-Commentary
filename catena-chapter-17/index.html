TIME? — And I will give to you and to your seed after you the land wherein you
wandered, even all the land of Canaan for an eternal possession. The question
is why he said “eternal”, when it was given to the Israelites for a time:
whether it was called “eternal” with respect to this world, so that from Greek
αἰών, which also means saeculum (in English “world”), there was said αἰώνιον as
though you could say saeculare in Latin (in English, “worldly”); or whether we
are forced from this to understand something pertaining to a spiritual promise,
so that it was called eternal because something eternal is signified by it; or
whether it rather belongs to an expression of the Scriptures, so that these
call eternal a thing whose end is not determined or which is not done without
necessity to be done continually as far as lies in the care or power of the
doer, as when Horace says, “He who does not know how to be content with little
shall be eternally a slave” (Ep. 1, 10, 41).<span> 
</span>A person cannot eternally be a slave when their life itself, during
which they are a slave, cannot be eternal. I would not use this evidence if it
did not pertain to an expression. Naturally, those people are for us
authorities concerning words, not concerning facts or opinions. Now if the
Scriptures are defended concerning peculiar expressions, which are called
idioms, how much more will they be defended concerning those that they share
with other languages? <b>[Questions on

flesh, we shall be compelled to say that the oracle was false. For according to
the flesh he is no longer father of us all: but the example of his faith makes
us all sons of Abraham. How? And in what manner? With men it is incredible that
one should rise from the dead; as in like manner it is incredible also that
there should be offspring from aged persons as good as dead. But when Christ is
preached as having been crucified on the tree, and as having died and risen
again, we believe it. By the likeness therefore of our faith we are adopted
into the sonship of Abraham. <b>[Lecture

be observed that wherever in Greek we read testament, in the Hebrew language
there is 'treaty' or 'covenant', that is, berith. Now the Hebrews say that God
added the letter he from His own Name which among themselves is written with four
letters, to the names of Abraam and Sarah. For at first he was called Abram,
which means 'high father'; and afterwards he was called Abraam, which is
translated as 'father of many': for 'nations', which follows, is not
specifically contained in the name, but is understood. Nor should anyone wonder
why we have said that the Hebrew letter he has been added, when it appears to
the Greeks and to ourselves that the letter A has been added. For a
characteristic of that language is actually to write the letter he, but to read
it as the letter A. In similar fashion, contrariwise they often pronounce the
letter A by means of he. <b>[Hebrew

us not measure the works of God to our weakness and torment us with the laws of
nature; but, as faithful servants, let us recognize the immense power of our
Lord, believe in his promises, and rise above our natural weakness to enjoy the
favors announced to us, to merit his benevolence, and to honor him with all our
might.<span>  </span>For the greatest honor we can
give him is to trust in his power, even if the eyes of our flesh show us the
opposite. And how surprising is the greatest homage paid to God to reject
doubt? With our fellows, when we make promises subject to the change of
perishable things, if we do not doubt it, if we trust it, this absence of
doubt, this trust is regarded as the greatest honor we can make. If so with men
so changeable and helpless, must we not believe much better in what God has
announced to us, even when his promises are only to be fulfilled after a long
interval? of time? It is not without reason that I speak to you this way, it is
in order to put you in the same way, when we will approach the reading of
today, to understand how the good God, wanting to illustrate the patriarch, -
exercises his patience during so many years during which he did not abandon
himself to grief, indifference, despair, but always nourished his piety by his
hope. Now, to appreciate all the virtue of the patriarch, it is good to know
how much he has lived. This is what Blessed Moses clearly tells us, inspired by
the Holy Spirit. What does he say? When the righteous had obeyed the commands
of God and left Charran to go to the land of Chanaan, he was seventy years old.
As soon as he came to this land, God promised him that he would give it all to
his race, which would multiply to the point of being innumerable like sand and
stars. After this promise, he arrived at just many adventures, his descent into
Egypt because of famine, the rapture of Sara, followed immediately by an effect
of divine providence, his return from Egypt, the new insult that receives Sara
of the king of the Greeks and the help that God still gives them. Well! the
righteous seeing that so many contrary events succeeded this promise, had no
anxiety, and did not ask himself why all these assurances did not save him from
a thousand annoyances, and why he remained so long without children. Filled with
piety, he did not want to subject God's actions to human reason, but he
resigned himself to it and accepted with pleasure all that pleased God.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Ten years later he looked
upon Ishmael as the child for whom the prediction was to be fulfilled. For the
patriarch, at the birth of Ishmael, was eighty-six years old. But the good God
still exercises his patience for thirteen years, until the fulfillment of his
promise. He knew, indeed, that gold being purified with time in the furnace,
the virtue of the righteous also took more glory and brightness. When Abram was
ninety-nine, God appeared to him again. And why this long wait? To make known
to us, not only the virtue of the righteous and his patience, but also the
greatness of the divine power. But we must hear the very words of God. When he
was ninety-nine, God appeared to him and said to him: By these words appeared
to him, hear nothing material, and do not believe that the eyes of the flesh
can see the divine power and immutable, but consider everything religiously.
God appeared to him, that is to say, deigned to communicate with him, and
judged him worthy of his providence, lowering himself to speak to him: I am
your God, seeking to please me and to be irreproachable; <i>I will put my covenant between you and me, and I will multiply you
abundantly. And Abram fell on his face</i>.<b>
</b>(Gen. 17:2-3) What gratitude from the righteous, what goodness from God! I
am your God. It's as if he said: I've been watching over you until now; It is I
who brought you from your country so far, who has supported you in all times,
and who has made you the conqueror of your enemies: I did it! He does not say I
am God, but I am your God. See what immense goodness! as by the addition of
this word, he expresses his love for the just! He is the God of all the earth,
the workman whose hand has done everything, the Creator of heaven and earth, he
himself who says. I am your (266) God! what an honor for the just! this is how
he speaks to the prophets. Without doubt, then and now, he is the Lord of all,
and yet he deigns to call himself by the name of a servant, and we will hear
him say again: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
(Exodus III, 6.) Also the prophets usually say: God, my God, not to restrict
within the limits of their own person, the dominion of God, but to show how far
their love was going. This should not surprise us on the part of men, but on
the part of God himself it may seem strange and extraordinary. Let us not be
surprised, my beloved ones, but let us listen to the words of the Prophet:
Better, a single man who observes the Lord's will, than a thousand who
transgress it (Eccl XVI, 3); Let us listen also to the words of St. Paul: They
wore skins of sheep, goats, they were destitute, tormented, afflicted, and the
world was not worthy of possessing them. (Heb XI, 37, 38.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Thus the Prophet says
that one man doing the will of God is better than a thousand who depart from
it, and St. Paul, the doctor of the earth, recalling all the good men whose
suffering he knows, says again: the world was not worthy of possessing them. On
one side he puts the whole world, on the other those who suffer to teach us all
the power of virtue. So the Creator says to the patriarch: I am your God; I try
to please myself and to be irreproachable. I will keep you in mind of the
efforts of your virtue; I will make a covenant between you and me, and I will
multiply you abundantly. Not only will I multiply you, but, abundantly, which
indicates a great posterity: what he had previously expressed by the comparison
of sand and stars, he now expresses it by this word abundantly. This pious and
grateful servant, seeing that God lowered himself to take such care, was moved
by the weakness of his nature, the goodness of God, and his infinite power. He
fell on his face; which showed all his gratitude. Such a favor did not inspire
him with arrogance or pride, but a new humility He fell on his face. Such is
the true recognition that honors God, especially as it is more favored. He fell
on his face. The righteous dared not cast his eyes on himself and on the
weakness of his nature; he dared not rise, but his lowering showed his respect:
see now how much God appreciated him. </span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

clarity of these just predictions; see that to confirm them, he adds a letter
to his name, and says: You shall be the father of a multitude of nations: you
shall not call yourself Abram, but Abraham, because I have established you to
be the father of several peoples. Indeed, his first name indicates his travels
(for Abram means traveler, as those who know Hebrew know); his parents had
called him so when he left for the land of Chanaan. It may be said: his parents
being unfaithful, whence came their prescience to indicate the future by the
name they gave? This is a resource of the wisdom of God, who often acts through
the infidels and we find many other examples. The first that comes to mind is
Noah's name. It is not without reason, or by chance, that his parents gave him
this name; they presaged that in five hundred years the flood would come. It is
not that his father was a righteous man himself because he gave his son this
name, because the Holy Scripture teaches us that in this generation, Noah alone
was an accomplished righteous man. (Gen. VI, 9.) Had his father Lamech offered
him the model of virtues, Scripture would not have passed over it in silence,
and would not have said: Noah alone was right. Wishing to give a name to his
son, he said: His name shall be Noah; he will give us rest after our labors and
the fatigue of our hands, on this earth that the Lord God has cursed. (Gen. V,
29.) Whence came, tell me, this prescience of a future so remote? He will be
called Noah; he will give us rest, Noah, in Hebrew, means, rest. It was he,
when the earth would be invaded by the deluge, which alone was to save itself
and renew the human race, so it is said: it will give us rest; this word of
rest here signifying the deluge. Indeed, the earth was as tired by the
perversity (267) of its inhabitants that it bore with difficulty, when the
flood, by the terrible invasion of the waters, put an end to this perversity,
delivered the land from the defilement of its inhabitants and punishes them by
giving him rest: For death is rest for man. (Job, III, 23.) So you see that God
often makes predictions even by the infidels. As for the name that the parents
of the patriarch had given him, we know the cause from the beginning, when he
crossed the river to go to a foreign land.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

parents have given you this name to presage that you must come here: I add a
letter to you to teach you that you will be father of a multitude of nations.
See what precision in these words. He does not say of all nations, but of a
multitude of nations. As other peoples were to be put aside, so that the race
of the righteous might alone share in his inheritance, God said: I have
established you to be the father of a multitude of nations; knowing all your
virtue I will use you to teach the world: I will multiply you more and more and
I will bring out of you peoples and even kings. Let us stop on these words, my
beloved ones. In thinking of the age of the just and his extreme old age, we
will admire his faith and the power of God of a man already dead, so to speak,
and powerless in appearance, who must always have death before the eyes, God He
predicts that he will come out with an innumerable race and many nations, even
kings.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

and with your seed after you in all generations; as an everlasting covenant,
that I may be your God</i>. (Gen. 17:7) Not only will I grant you my
protection, but also to your race and after your death. See how he raises the

WHY DID ABRAHAM RECEIVE CIRCUMCISION AS A SIGN OF HIS FAITH? — If you want to
pay attention to it, you will see a perfect fit in what at first sight might
seem to you devoid of reason. Abraham believing that he would have a son in
which all nations would be blessed, and who would be the principle of all
holiness, received the sign of this promise on the member by whom the
generation of children begins, it tends to a higher holiness. If we were
tempted to see in it something different, let us remember that circumcision was
a subject of joy for Abraham, and that his children were always glorious in
this testimony. Indeed, Achior, one of the princes of the idolatrous nations,
witnesses of the great wonders of the God of Abraham, who by the hand of a
simple woman had cut off the head of that general of the olives Assyrian
militia, whose whole land dreaded power, wished to receive circumcision himself
as a mark of honor and dignity (Judith 13:27; 14:16). Is not a Christian proud
to have lost an eye or a member for the name of Jesus Christ? does he not
discover this part mutilated in the eyes of men as a title of glory? And in
this way, a momentary loss for faith is a real gain. The circumcision which
Abraham received as a sign of his faith, was therefore for him not a mutilation
of the soul, but a mark of honor. Now this ceremony signified in the spiritual
sense that the clouds of the flesh were to be cut off from the hearts of men by
the faith of Jesus Christ, because the error of the senses, covering the hearts
of men as a cloud, an obstacle to the Creator’s knowledge. Now, Abraham, to
whom God promised that the Christ who was to dispel this cloud would be born
one day of his race was circumcised, because he believed that a son would be
born to him that would destroy this error. Judge now whether it was not proper
that he should receive on this part of the body the sign of his faith.

JEWISH PEOPLE CIRCUMCISION AND OTHER PRECEPTS THAT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE AND
WHICH HAVE NOW LOST ALL AUTHORITY? — Circumcision is the sign of Abraham’s
faith, and it was established to be the distinguishing sign of the children of
that patriarch who received this sign after having believed in the promise of
God. The precepts that relate to the sanctification of the Sabbath were given
as a testimony of the past and a figure of the future. This sabbath, which is
like the crowning of every week accomplished, is the figure of the Sabbath
which must one day put us in possession of an eternal rest. (Ex. 20) The law
relating to food was not given at the beginning, but when, under the
inspiration of unbelief, the Jews refused to believe in the words and promises
of God; it was then that they received imperfect precepts, as the prophet says
(Ezek. 20:25), and whose purpose was to lower their haughty heads and bring
them back to the earth to be better. It was not just, indeed, that all
creatures should be subordinate to haughty and obstinate men. But when the
mercy of God spread over men, it gave them freedom in the choice of food. So
the apostle Peter said: “Why did you impose upon the heads of your brethren a
yoke which neither our fathers nor we could bear? “(Acts 15:10.) <b>[Questions on the Old and New Testaments,

It was, moreover, a figure of baptism. For just as the circumcision does not
cut off a useful member of the body but only a useless extra section, so by the
holy baptism we are circumcised from sin, and sin clearly is, so to speak, the
superfluous part of desire and not useful desire. For it is quite impossible
that any one should have no desire at all nor ever experience the taste of pleasure.
But the useless part of pleasure, that is to say, useless desire and pleasure,
it is this that is sin from which holy baptism circumcises us, giving us as a
token the precious cross on the brow, not to divide us from the Gentiles (for
all the nations received baptism and were sealed with the sign of the Cross),
but to distinguish in each nation the faithful from the faithless. Wherefore,
when the truth is revealed, circumcision is a senseless figure and shade. So
circumcision is now superfluous and contrary to holy baptism. For he who is
circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law. (Gal. 5:3) Further, the Lord was
circumcised that He might fulfil the law: and He fulfilled the whole law and
observed the Sabbath that He might fulfil and establish the law. (Mt. 5:17)
Moreover after He was baptized and the Holy Spirit had appeared to men,
descending on Him in the form of a dove, from that time the spiritual service
and conduct of life and the Kingdom of Heaven was preached. <b>[Orth. Faith 4.25 NPNF s.2 v.9]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

WHY DID GOD COMMAND THE CIRCUMCISION OF THE CHILDREN ON THE EIGHTH DAY? — God
commanded to circumcise every male child on the eighth day after his birth,
because after the number of seven days had passed, the eighth day became like
the first after the Sabbath, and was no longer the eighth, but the first. As
the salvation which Christ was to bring to the world was to take place on the
first day called the day of the Lord, because the Lord resurrected that day
after the Sabbath; the figurative sign of salvation was given in circumcision
to make known the future regeneration even under the law of circumcision. It
was by faith that men were to be saved, and this faith received its
confirmation on the first day of the resurrection of the Savior; the figurative
sign of salvation was thus established on the first day in the law of
circumcision, which was also to be the sign of the faith of Abraham. Harmony is
therefore complete here; the sign of the past faith which was given on the
first day, was the figure of the future faith which was firmly established on
the first day. <b>[Questions on the Old and

I believe he had two reasons for prescribing this term; the one because, in so
tender an age, the operation is less painful; the other, to indicate that it is
only a mark, without utility for the soul. The new-born child, who knows
nothing and understands nothing, what advantage can he receive from it? What
can be good for the soul comes to him by his own choice. What is good for the
soul is to prefer virtue to vice; it is to desire only the necessary, and to
distribute the superfluous to the needy; what is good for the soul is not to
attach itself to the present, and even to despise it, always thinking of the
future. What good can there be in a carnal sign? This sign of circumcision
separated the Jews from other nations, and showed that God had chosen them in
particular; in the same way our circumcision speaks baptism better-the
separation of the faithful and infidels. We are not circumcised in the flesh,
but by the entrenchment of the sins of the flesh. For what the circumcision of
the flesh did, baptism does this by suppressing our sins. Once we have stripped
them and put on the robe of purity, persevere, my beloved ones, in this purity,

the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because
he has broken my covenant,” (Gen. 17:14) some may be troubled how that ought to
be understood, since it can be no fault of the infant whose life it is said
must perish; nor has the covenant of God been broken by him, but by his
parents, who have not taken care to circumcise him. But even the infants, not
personally in their own life, but according to the common origin of the human
race, have all broken God’s covenant in that one in whom all have sinned.<span>  </span>Now there are many things called God’s
covenants besides those two great ones, the old and the new, which anyone who
pleases may read and know. For the first covenant, which was made with the
first man, is just this: “In the day you eat thereof, you shall surely die.”
(Gen. 2:17) Whence it is written in the book called Ecclesiasticus, “All flesh
waxes old as does a garment. For the covenant from the beginning is, You shall
die the death.” (Sir. 15:17) Now, as the law was more plainly given afterward,
and the apostle says, “Where no law is, there is no prevarication,” (Rom. 4:15)
on what supposition is what is said in the psalm true, “I accounted all the
sinners of the earth prevaricators,” except that all who are held liable for
any sin are accused of dealing deceitfully (prevaricating) with some law? If on
this account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief, born in
sin, not actual but original, so that we confess they have need of grace for
the remission of sins, certainly it must be acknowledged that in the same sense
in which they are sinners they are also prevaricators of that law which was
given in Paradise, according to the truth of both scriptures, “I accounted all
the sinners of the earth prevaricators,” and “Where no law is, there is no
prevarication.” And thus, because circumcision was the sign of regeneration,
and the infant, on account of the original sin by which God’s covenant was
first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation unless delivered by
regeneration, these divine words are to be understood as if it had been said,
Whoever is not born again, that soul shall perish from his people, because he
has broken my covenant, since he also has sinned in Adam with all others. For
had He said, Because he has broken this my covenant, He would have compelled us
to understand by it only this of circumcision; but since He has not expressly
said what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand Him as
speaking of that covenant of which the breach can be ascribed to an infant. Yet
if any one contends that it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in
it the infant has broken the covenant of God because, he is not circumcised, he
must seek some method of explanation by which it may be understood without
absurdity (such as this) that he has broken the covenant, because it has been
broken in him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is to be observed
that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of neglect against itself,
would perish unjustly, unless original sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.

this mark of circumcision, to tame their evil inclinations and to prevent them
from mingling with other nations. He knew their penchant for evil, and knew
that, despite a host of warnings, their bad passions would not be chained. Also,
as an imperishable memory, he imposed upon them this sign of circumcision, as a
bond which subjected them to impassable laws, to remain faithful to their
nation and never to mingle with other peoples, so that the race of the
patriarch would remain pure and receive the fulfillment of the divine promises.
Just as a gentle and wise man who has a maid brought to disobedience, gives him
the precise order not to leave the house, and that sometimes he even chains it
to contain his vagabond instinct; so God, in his goodness, imposed on them the
sign of circumcision as a hindrance, so that this particular mark would prevent
them from seeking anything from others.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

senseless Jews still want circumcision, which is no longer needed, and thus show
their childishness. For what reason, tell me, do they now want to be
circumcised? Then they had received this precept not to mingle with the ungodly
nations, but now that the grace of God has brought them all to the light of
truth, what is circumcision for? Can this removal of a piece of flesh serve to
deliver our soul? Did they not understand that if God said to them, it would be
the sign of the covenant, he meant that their weakness required a particular
mark? This is what usually happens in human things. When we doubt someone, we
demand proof that assures us of his good faith. In the same way the Almighty,
knowing the inconstancy of their spirit, required of them this sign, not to
preserve it always, but so that it disappeared when the antique law would have
ended and that this sign would have become useless. Those who have asked for
proof of good faith leave it out when the case is over; likewise here, this
mark had been introduced among you to distinguish the posterity of the
patriarch; but after these nations of which you were so separated have been,
some destroyed, others called to the great day of truth, cease to bear the
proof of your weakness and return to your primitive nature. Remember that this
admirable man, that is to say, the patriarch, before having received the order
of circumcision (he was then ninety-nine years old), had been pleasing to God
and had been a thousand times praised by the Lord. Now that the promises were
about to be fulfilled, that Isaac would come into the world, that the race
would increase and that the patriarch was coming to an end, he received the
precept of circumcision, and he himself submits to it. at his age, so that his
example becomes a rule for his descendants.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

show you, my beloved, that this use is of no use to the soul. What does God
say? The eight-day-old boy will be circumcised. I think there were two reasons
for prescribing that term; one because, in such a tender age, the operation is
less painful; the other, to indicate that it is only a mark, without any use
for the soul. The newborn child, who knows and understands nothing, what
benefit can he receive? What can be good for the soul comes to him by his own
choice. What is good for the soul is to prefer virtue to vice, it is to desire
only the necessary, and to distribute the superfluity to the needy; what is
good for the soul is not to cling to the present and even to despise it, always
thinking of the future. What good can there be in a carnal sign? But the
ungrateful and senseless Jews, when the truth has passed, still remain in the
shadows; while the sun of righteousness has risen and scattered its rays
everywhere, they only light by the light of their lamp; when it is time to
taste solid foods, they still eat milk and do not want to hear the voice of St.
Paul, who tells them so powerfully, about their patriarch: He received the mark
of the circumcision as a sign of the righteousness he had had by faith. (Romans
IV, 11.)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">See how the Apostle shows
us that it was only a sign, and that this circumcision showed that his faith
had justified him. That a Jew does not dare to say to us: is it not the
circumcision which justified it? the same saint, raised by Gamaliel (Act XXII,
3) and, knowing the law so profoundly, will say to him: Do not believe,
impudent Jews, that circumcision does something to justify, for before that
time Abraham believed God and his faith was known to him for justice. (Romans
IV, 3.) It was after having been justified by his faith that he received
circumcision. God begins by adding a letter to his name, then orders him to
circumcise, which shows that the Lord has adopted him for his virtue, as well
as his posterity. Just as he who has bought a slave, often changes his name and
costume, to find that he is his master and can command him; so also the Lord of
all things, wishing to distinguish the patriarch from other men, adds a letter
to his name to show that he will be the father of an infinite multitude, then
he is circumcised to separate him and his people, other nations. Those whose
blindness still wishes to preserve it, do not listen to these other words of
St. Paul: If you are circumcised, Christ will serve you nothing. (Galatians, v.
2.) Indeed, the Lord is (269) come to suppress this practice, and the law being
fulfilled, the observance of the law must end; So St. Paul says: If you justify
yourself by the law, you lose grace. (Gal 4: 4) Let us then obey this saint,
and do not practice circumcision any more, for he said: You have been
circumcised, not in the flesh, but by the entrenchment of the sins of the
flesh; it is the circumcision of Christ. (Colossi II, 11)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

separated the Jews from other nations, and showed that God had chosen them in
particular; in the same way our circumcision speaks baptism shows better-the
separation of the faithful and the infidels. We are not circumcised in the
flesh, but by the entrenchment of the sins of the flesh. For what the
circumcision of the flesh did, baptism does by removing our sins. Once we have
stripped ourselves of it and put on the robe of purity, persevere, my beloved,
in this purity, and remain superior to the affections of the flesh, embracing
virtue. And we, who are under grace, take as a model one who lived under the
law and even before the law. In directing our lives according to his own, we
deserve to be found in his bosom and to enjoy eternal goods, by the grace and
goodness of Our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, as well as to the Father and to the

people are mistaken who think that the name Sara was written first with one R
and that another R was afterwards added to it; and because among the Greeks R
represents the number 100, they surmise many absurd things about her name. At
any rate, in whatever way they maintain that her name was altered, it ought not
to have a Greek but a Hebrew explanation, since the name itself is Hebrew. And
no one who calls someone by a name in one language takes the etymology of that
word from another language. Therefore Sarai was at first named with the letters
sin, res, iod; then iod, that is, the element i, was taken away; letter he,
which is read as A, was added; so she was called Sara. Now this is the reason
why her name was changed in this way: formerly she was called 'my ruler', the
mother of a household of one house only; thereafter she was called 'ruler'
absolutely, that is, archousa.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

called Sarai. That is, you shall not say to her, 'You are my ruler', because
she is already the future ruler of all the nations. Some people quite wrongly
suppose that she had formerly been named 'leprosy', and later 'ruler', on the
grounds that leprosy is called sarath, which in our language seems to bear at
least some similarity [to Sarai]; but in Hebrew it is utterly different. For it
is written with sade and res and ain and thau, which is clearly very different
from the three letters above, that is, sin, res, and he, with which Saraa is

this will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. The eight-day-old boy
will be circumcised. And if anyone is not circumcised, his soul will perish,
because he will have broken my covenant. We have finished here what we have

and then to leave; we want to measure to your strength the instruction
contained in our speeches, so that you bring home some fruit of our words. Here
are the remains of this speech; we shall see, after the precept of
circumcision, what the God of kindness says to the patriarch. And God, say to
Abraham, <i>Sarah thy wife shall not be
called Sarah, but Sarrah shall be her name</i>.<b> </b>(Gen. 17:16) As well as adding a letter to your name, I have shown
that you would be a father of many nations, so I add a letter to Sarah's, to

be fulfilled. Sarrah will be his name. I will bless her, and I will give you a
son of her, and I will bless him, and he shall be ruler of a nation, and the
kings of the nations shall come out of him. I added a letter to tell you that
all my words will come true. Do not be discouraged by thinking of the weakness

beyond human nature; it was as if we had promised to make men with stones. For
they differed nothing from the stones in the point of view of generation. The
old age of the patriarch rendered him almost impotent and incapable of having
children; as for Sara, besides her infertility, she was far too advanced in
age. But the righteous, when he heard these words, was persuaded that God had
already fulfilled his promise to Ishmael. Indeed, in these words: I will give
this earth to you and to your race, God did not specify in a precise way the
son that Sara must have, Abraham therefore believed that the promise was
already accomplished. <b>[Homilies on

Deity is first the Angel of God, and then, successively, Lord and God. But to
Abraham He is God only. For when the distinction of Persons had first been
made, as a safeguard against the delusion that God is a solitary Being, then
His true and unqualified name could safely be uttered. And so it is written.
And God said to Abraham, Behold Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you
shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as far Ishmael, behold.
I have heard you and have blessed him, and will multiply him exceedingly;

(Gen.17:19-20) Is it possible to doubt that He Who was previously called the
Angel of God is here, in the sequel, spoken of as God? In both instances He is
speaking of Ishmael; in both it is the same Person Who shall multiply him. To
save us from supposing that this was a different Speaker from Him who had
addressed Hagar, the Divine words expressly attest the identity, saying, And I
have blessed him, and will multiply him. The blessing is repeated from a former
occasion, for Hagar had already been addressed; the multiplication is promised
for a future day, for this is God’s first word to Abraham concerning Ishmael.
Now it is God Who speaks to Abraham; to Hagar the Angel of God had spoken. Thus
God and the Angel of God are One; He Who is the Angel of God is also God the
Son of God. He is called the Angel because He is the Angel of great counsel;
but afterwards He is spoken of as God, lest we should suppose that He Who is
God is only an angel. Let us now repeat the facts in order. The Angel of the
Lord spoke to Hagar; He spoke also to Abraham as God. One Speaker addressed
both. The blessing was given to Ishmael, and the promise that he should grow
into a great people.<b> [On the Trinity,

LAUGHED, AND SAID IN HIS HEART. SHALL A SON BE BORN TO A MAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS
OLD, AND SHALL SARA AGED NINETY BEAR CHILDREN? THEN, AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, AND
YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISAAC. There is a difference of opinion why he was
called Isaac, but only one etymology of the name; for Isaac means 'laughter'.
Some people say that because Saraa had laughed, he was therefore called
'laughter'; but this is incorrect. Others, however, say that it was because
Abraham laughed; and this is what we approve. For it was in consequence of
Abraham's laughter that his son was called Isaac; only then do we read that
Saraa also laughed. But it should be known that four persons in the Old
Testament were called by their names without any concealment before they were
born: Ishmael, Isaac, Solomon, and Josias. Read the Scriptures.<b> [Hebrew Questions on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Now when the Lord said to him, I will bless Sarra, and I will give you a son of
her, and I will bless him, and he shall rule the nations; then, moreover, the
kings of the nations will come out of him; not knowing what to say (for such a
pious man could not doubt the words of God), thinking of his old age and Sara's
persistent sterility, crushed and stunned by the promise of God, <i>he fell on his face and laughed</i>.<b> </b>(Gen. 17:17) Before this unheard-of
promise, before the power of the one who made it, he fell on his face and began
to laugh, that is to say, he was filled with joy. He sought in his reflections
how he could agree with the order of human things that a centenarian had a son,
and that a sterile, nonagenarian woman suddenly became fertile. Such were his
thoughts, but his tongue dared not state them; only he showed his gratitude by
praying for Ishmael, as if he were saying: "Lord, you have comforted me
enough, and you have changed in joy by the birth of Ishmael the pain of being
without posterity. After his birth I never believed or even imagined that I
would have a son of Sara; she herself did not expect it and had given up hope,
since she had given me Hagar. We both had great consolation by the birth of
Ishmael. <i>May this son, who was given to
me by you, live before your face</i>, (Gen. 17:18) and we will have enough
happiness; and his presence will comfort our old age. What does this good Lord
answer to this? As he had long since felt the piety of the righteous and the
faith of Sarah, as he saw that they expected nothing of themselves, one because
of his old age, the other because of his age and from his sterility, he says,
it seems to you completely impossible: that's why I waited so long; you will
know that the favors I have are far above human nature; everyone will know, as
you do by these wonders, that I am the Master of Nature, that she obeys all my
wishes and yields to all my orders. I, who have drawn being from nothingness,
can, with much greater reason, correct nature when it is imperfect. To give you
confidence, listen and reassure yourself, receive a sure guarantee of my word.
Here is your wife Sara, whom you think you can not bear because of her
infertility and old age: she will give you a son, and so that you do not doubt
it, I will even tell you her name in advance. Your unborn son will be called
Isaac. <i>I will make a covenant with him</i>
(271) <i>forever and with his race after him</i>.
(Gen. 17:19) It is he whom I have promised you first and from the beginning,
and it is in him that my promises will be fulfilled. I warn you of all this,
not only because it must be born, but so that you know how you will call it and
that I have made a covenant, not only with him, but with his race after him.
Then this God whose benefits always exceed our prayers, thus strengthening the
spirit of the righteous and having almost rejuvenated him by his promises,
since he had, so to speak, brought back, by his words, from death to life and
even to fecundity, says to him as the height of liberality: I will fulfill all
these promises and I will grant you besides what you asked me for Ishmael,
because I heard your prayer. <i>I will bless
him; I will increase it and multiply it more and more. He will beget twelve
nations, and I will make him a great people</i>. (Gen. 17:20) Since he is your
race, I will increase him and multiply him abundantly, to the point of bringing
twelve nations out of him. <i>But I will
make my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear you at this time, in a year's
time</i>.<b> </b>(Gen. 17:21)</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Here, I pray you, see, my
beloved, how the righteous received in an instant the reward of all his life,
and how was accomplished in him what Christ said to his disciples: Whoever will
leave father, mother, family and brothers in my name, will receive the hundredfold
and will gain eternal life. (Matt XIX, 29.) Consider, I pray you, to our
righteous who obeyed without delay the order of the Lord and preferred another
land to his homeland, see how his continual resignation raised him little by
little to the height of virtue, as he became illustrious and famous, and how
the number of his descendants could be compared to that of the stars. If one
could calculate at the rigor, one would find that the just has not been
rewarded a hundred times, but ten thousand times. If he has been honored until
now with so many benefits, what voice can ever tell those who will follow? It
is best to say it; as much as possible, of a single word. If it be said to you
that all the righteous, from that time to ours and to the consummation of the
times, have had and will have no other desire than to rest in the bosom of the
patriarch, that can we say more glorious for him? You have appreciated his
resignation, his virtue, his piety and all, his gratitude for the blessings of
the Lord. When he had to, he did everything that depended on him, he accepted
with all good grace, pleasure and displeasure; so the God of goodness finally
granted him the first of all good things, the one he desired above all else.
Notice, indeed, that he has experienced for twenty-four years the virtue of the
just! For when he came out of Charran to obey the Lord, he was seventy-five
years old, and now, when God spoke to him again, he only needed a year to be a
hundred years old.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">May this story, my
beloved ones, teach us to be always resigned, and never to let ourselves be
defeated or discouraged by the trials of virtue; let us understand by this the
whole goodness and generosity of the Lord who, for a small offering, gives us a
great reward, not only for the immortal goods of the future, but in filling us
with his favors to relieve our weakness in this world . Thus our patriarch,
during this space of time, had no doubt to endure hard trials, but his
adversities were always intermixed with happy moments. For the Almighty,
indulgent to our weakness, does not abandon us in the midst of adversities that
we can not bear; he is vain to come to our aid, he revives our courage and
recalls our reason; so he will not leave us too long in prosperity which would
make us negligent and favor our bad inclinations. In fact, human nature, in the
midst of prosperity, sometimes forgets itself, and leaves the limits that suit
it; also our Father who loves us, sometimes favors us and sometimes tests us,
in order to watch over our salvation anyway. Just as a doctor, when treating a
patient, does not always subject him to the diet and does not always let him
satisfy his hunger, lest his greed increases his fever or deprivation weakens
him; he spares the forces of the patient, and uses all his art to be useful to
him. It is thus that the good God, knowing what suits each one of us, sometimes
makes us enjoy prosperity, sometimes submits us to trials to exercise ourselves
to virtue. Those whose merit is already worthy of praise shine again in the
midst of trials and receive a new grace from above; At the same time, sinners
who accept these trials heartily, are delivered from the burden of their sins,
and obtain their forgiveness. As well I beg you, knowing the intelligence and
wisdom of the doctor of our souls, never discuss the care he gives us. If our
minds can not understand them, this is one more reason to admire the purposes
of God and to glorify the Lord, whose reason and human thought can not
appreciate wisdom. We do not know as well as he does what suits us; we do not
watch over our salvation as He watches over it himself, for he makes every
effort to attract us to virtue and to save us from the hands of the devil. If
he sees that prosperity is not advantageous to us, he is like a good doctor who
heals us in the obesity produced by our greed and which heals us by sobriety.
In the same way, this admirable doctor of our souls allows us to be a little
tested to make us understand the dangers of prosperity, but when he sees that
we have returned to health, he delivers us from our trials and gives us his
favors in abundance. . If, therefore, virtuous persons are subjected to certain
trials, let them not be troubled by them, but hope for them, and see them as
the source of new crowns and rewards. If sinners fall into adversity, let them
not revolt, knowing that sins are purified by misfortune, provided they accept
everything with good grace. Indeed, a grateful servant must thank his master,
not only when he receives all of it, but also in privations. Thus the patriarch
became illustrious and was honored with the favor of God, who lavished on him
benefits above human nature.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">We must now resume the
rest of our speech and notice the obedience of the just. Who executed the order
of God without seeking the reason and without asking the cause, as do so many
fools who discuss the works of God, and say why this? Why that? What is this
for? What is it for? Such was not the just; as a devoted servant, he
accomplishes the order without seeking beyond, you will still see him by what
follows. After the Lord had made the promise to Him and finished talking to
Him, the righteous man immediately did what was commanded of Him, <i>and this mark required by God, that is to
say, circumcision</i>,<b> </b>(Gen.
17:26-27) He immediately made it suffer Ishmael and to all servants born at
home or bought abroad. He himself was circumcised. He was ninety-nine when he
cut the flesh of his foreskin. <i>Ishmael
was then thirteen years old</i>. (Gen. 17:24-25) It is not without reason that
Scripture reports here the number of its years; it is to show the great
obedience of the righteous who was then in extreme old age and willingly
endured pain to fulfill the order of God; so we count not only him, but Ishmael
and all his servants; the operation must have been painful. It's not the same
thing, . my beloved ones, to cut healthy flesh and sick flesh; when the doctors
cut a sick limb the pain is not so great, for this limb, already dead, so to
speak, has only a remnant of sensation at the moment of amputation. Now, this
old man, so advanced in age, for he touched his hundred years, willingly
supported this pain, in order to obey God; at the same time he disposed his son
and his servants to show without hesitation the same obedience. See, what
virtue in this man, and how he commits his whole house to follow in his
footsteps. What I said yesterday, I repeat today; From that moment God wished
that this operation should be practiced on infants, so that it would be less
painful.</span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font><p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:10pt">Consider, my beloved, the
goodness of God and his ineffable beneficence to us. This circumcision brought
pain and discomfort; it had no other advantage than to have those who had
received it recognized and separated from other nations. Our circumcision, I
mean the grace of baptism, heals us without pain and gives us innumerable
goods; it fills us with the grace of the Holy Spirit and can be done at any
time. We can practice in childhood, in old age and in old age this immaterial
and harmless circumcision that delivers us from our sins and makes us obtain
the forgiveness of those of our whole life. God, seeing the excess from our
weakness, and recognizing that our incurable troubles required a heroic remedy,
as well as a supreme indulgence, took care of our salvation and allowed us to
wash away our sins and regenerate our souls; in this way we strip the old man,
that is, the works of evil, and we put on the new man, walking in the way of
virtue. But, I conjure you, let us not remain inferior (273) to the Jews,
ungrateful and insensate. These, having received the mark of circumcision, were
very careful not to be like other nations; at least not to have relations with
them; for, as to impiety, they sometimes passed them. For us, when we have
received baptism, instead of circumcision, let us carefully watch over our
conduct. No doubt we can mingle with the infidels, but remain faithful to our
virtues, and we must communicate with them only to attract them to the world.
so that the example of our good works may be a lesson for them. So the Almighty
has allowed this mixture of good and bad, pious men and impious, so that the
wicked profit with the good and the impious are brought to piety; for God has
nothing so much at heart as the salvation of our souls. So, I conjure you, let
us not neglect our salvation, nor that of our neighbor; do everything that
depends on us so that our conduct may please God; as to the next, let our
virtue so explode that, even while remaining silent, our example is a lesson
for all who can see us. If we are virtuous, we will derive a great advantage,
and at the same time we will be useful to the infidels; likewise, if we neglect
our conduct, we will be severely punished for it, and we will become for the
others an occasion of scandal. Thus, when we practice virtue, we are twice rewarded
by God, first of all on our behalf and then because of those whom we promise to
practice as well; likewise, if we do evil, we will be punished, not only for
our own sins, but for those where we train others. God forbid that none of
those present be in this situation; but let us regulate our conduct so as to
edify those who see us, so that we may present ourselves with confidence before
the judgment seat of Christ and merit his infinite goods; may it be so for all
of us, by the grace and goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, as well as
to the Father and the Holy Spirit, glory, power, honor, now and always, and for
centuries. Amen.<b> [Homilies on Genesis]</b></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
